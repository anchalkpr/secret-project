Thanking you
0 0 Those vehicles will in other parts of the country and pollute there ! I wish to bring to your notice that there are some products available in the market which reduce vehicular pollution to a very great extent . If the state owned OMCs add these products in the fuel itself all the vehicles will get the benefit of fuel savings and less emissions . Hon'le Finance Minister in his last budget has increased ED on such branded fuels by Rs. 2.50 per litre .that is more revenue for the govt.
0 0 Respected Minister Of Petroleum & natural Gas , This refers to the recent decision / suggestion of NGT ( National Green Tribunal ) that in Delhi NCR diesel engines vehicles of more than 10 yrs will /should not allowed to ply on roads . I wish to bring to your notice that if this is implemented people owning such vehicles will be at a great loss because they will have to replace those with new vehicles . These vehicles which are more than 10 years old will not be scrapped !
5 0 Namaste, India must go for Waste to energy to save oil, gas, coal etc. and to save envionment. India has huge amount of municipal waste which is currently disposed by landfilling. The same MSW can be converted into electricity through gasifier. Through this we can save fuel and can make our environment cleaner. MSW faification has huge potential and We are far far behind in this area.
1 0 respected sir, please keep the petrol price constant at list three months. for road furniture, you include some money in this price. people are wainting for toll off on every road. they have a keen interest in this. so you can cover this cost in petrol price. see any other factor that you get some additional income and it will help to promate the public transport.people aretalking negativeabout your party , they say they donot know how impresses the public. some little changes in the day today l
6 0 There can be multiple ways for conservation. few of them are -
1. People to be encouraged to use public transport. Provide better public transport - AC buses, Metro etc.
2. Use of solar energy. It should be compulsary for all new colonies for common lighting.
3. Rain water harvesting - It should be compulsary fao all new housing projects to have rain water harvesing system.
4. Use electric driven cars. The same should be made cheaper by cutting duties & taxes all over India.
0 0 Honorable Defense Minister,
In defense organisation work place and residence area are in nearby each other but defense personals uses four wheeler or two wheeler which is neither good for their fitness nor for import of petroleum product.There are lakhs of defense personals.There should be release a order by head of staff that if the work place is under 5 km from residence area then personals should not use car or bike for coming to duty it will save petrol and fitness of Javaans.    Jai Hind.
2 0 Place a water pump which can send the water on the top of the building and have a water tank on the terrace with a capacity of 50000 liters.
Now just drop the water through a pipe with high speed jet on the turbines and they will rotate and produce electricity. This will be enough to light up the building, use to run the lift, air conditioners ets. And also surplus electricity to be sold to other smaller buildings.
1 0 Idea for Power Generation 
Hi,
My idea is to erect water turbines on every building which has a height of more than 30 meters at a distance of 10 meters each. So if a building has a height of 100 meters then install 10 water turbines in a single line 1 below each at a distance of 10 meters.
Now have 1 water tank below on the ground floor with a capacity of 50000 liters.

0 0 Shri.Modijee, Let us try and promote the positive aspect of beef ban. Cattle which is termed as useless for farming, dairy and other physical activities could be used for its 'cattle dung'to generate bio-gas. Bio gas is a best option for house hold cooking, at least in rural areas.Only challenge being its storage and transportation.LPG saved thus can be sold in urban areas for automotive purpose (CNG supply is insufficient)at non-subsidized rates. We can save a big amount of foreign exchange.
0 0 population threat is more dangerous than terrorism in our country. Control them, it will automatically reduce so many problems of the country. Frame justified law to control it. Reduce use of subsidised fuel by quota system as per income group. Provide better access to cooking gas through hassle-free door delivery on demand to those who give up subsidy as reciprocal arrangement.
0 0 while i agree to the suggestion of giving up the subsidy by the affluent, may I suggest to convey the same to our elected representatives at central and states to give up all their perks and freebies enjoyed at the cost of exchequer or even to withdraw all the perks and subsidies enjoyed by them at one stroke and also to rein in them to follow all the laws and rules followed by the common man. I think with this, there will be some semblance in the coiuntry to start with.
0 0 why not ask politicians to pay for all medical services, Z-security, food and amenities, foreign and domestic travel they enjoy  with families and huge delegations
0 0 why not ask politicians to not take fat honorariums from Parliament as all they do is break furniture in the house, do rowdy behavior, make unnecessary demonstrations to stall house proceedings. why not ask politicians not to get highly subsidized food in all assemblies and the Parliament also. why not ask politicians not to occupy highly luxurious mansions at nation's cost? why not ask politicians to pay for all medical services, Z-security, food and amenities, travel they enjoy
0 0 Right from birth to death every Indian is preached save this and save that..why no neta is preached anything?Politicians can afford to enjoy life at our costs?Indian citizens are already bearing the brunt of one scam after another,still no neta has ever been booked.Legal authorities will NEVER find any evidence to book any neta at all, and that is an unwritten LAW.Why no appraisal of ministers work is done for all the amenities he enjoys?Netas are always above law ?
0 0 Modiji-all the Gyan is meant for citizens only or something is for the netas also?Netas who once enter politics enjoy a lifelong picnic..free food,free housing in mansions with amenities we cant even dream of,free security,free top class medical care, free travel etc etc all at nation's  costs?
0 0 Modiji is appealing to the public to leave the domestic gas subsidy so that netas can enjoy longer motorcades with that money?Why cant Modiji tell the politicians not to draw honorariums from the Parliament when actually what they do it break furniture,do walkouts,do tamaashas,watch porn in the Parliament?Why cant Modiji be fair and just?Why cant Modiji make the errant netas who break furniture and do rowdy behavior in parliament and state assemblies work/ earn and repay for the losses?
0 0 India Govt. is very good at preaching "Save Petrol" to its citizens,but all that is preached is not practiced by the netas themselves,when netas go anywhere they have huge motorcades... 15-20 vehicles in front and behind them,then why do they only preach us to "SAVE" why dont they put their speeches into practice and set an example?Netas want huge motorcades with red beacons and sirens and alarms,with Z-Security at public costs, public are only there to "SAVE" everything for the netas?
0 0 Dear Sir,Please make the prices for Petrolium prodcut for in round figure as we do not have fractions (Paise) in reality , if person fill up Petrol in scooter E.G. Fill up 5 lit at 64.51 rupees as 323 and not 322.55 this loss of 45 Piase do not go into Govt. Treasury, E.G. if sell of Petrol in Country per day is 50 Million ltrs, govt is loosing 22,50,000 rs which is unaccounted and should go in govt Treasury . This way citizen do not have to face frequent hike in prices which may get avoided.
0 1 Respected sir,
As our PM Requesting people to give up subsidies, fine Idea is super but majority of the people may not take positive, what I meant to say is, the people who give up subsidies they must be encouraged by giving some incentives like " Crore Pati of the Month" announce every month one crore pati per district by giving one crore to the family by selecting randomly this may attract the people and will come forward. I hope this Idea will definitely work.
Thank you
0 0 Idea for Urban Planners in Chennai:To ensure the faster development of satellite townships,the need to provide 3rd and 4th railway lines in between Tambaram and Chengulpet (30km) is the need of the hour.
I suggest to use the land in  existing alignment of abandoned MG line as elevated corridor with pillar and bridge structure for two more lines to deal with express and goods and leave the present infrastructure for suburban train system.Time and Cost factors and faster commissioning is possible
0 0 Idea:Need for Policy decision to sanction 3d and 4 th railway lines together at a time (Metro areas to augment suburban system) at once for optimal costs and asset productivity(example:Instead of sanction of 60 km length of  3 railway line,its better to sanction 30km of 3d and 4th line in phase-1 and balance 30km of 3rd and 4th line in Phase-2).

0 1 A Small Poem to encourage people to give up lpg subsidy
http://capankajjain.blogspot.com/2015/03/lpg-subsidy-give-it-up.html
0 0 Om+786
All new roads are to be planned so that there are separate lanes for bi-cycles and pedestrians.People are seldom time-constrained and feel it is not below dignity to reach their office by bi-cycles or on foot if there is road safety. About 50% of daily commuters are expected to use bi-cycles or go on foot if there is safe and favourable roads and paths!
Amen.
0 1 Sir, I am of the firm opinion that use of personal four-wheeler for going office both private and public should be banned. This will not only save petroleum, natural gas, diesel etc but also get the cities rid of traffic problem. Presently payment of Transport allowance is much prevalent in govt. and private sectors. Those who use personal vehicle for going offices should be deprived of Transport allowance baring women employees
0 0 Sir, I have an idea which I thought should be shared. Sir in production of electricity can be easily solved by making installation of photovoltaic solar panels for new house construction should be made compulsory.Since batteries cost the maximum amount in off grid solar system, people are reluctant.Transferring the electricity back to electricity board with dual line electric meter in case of excess production and receiving electricity from grid in less production and night.
0 0 Instead of using Coal as a source of power, how about we use natural gas which is more eco friendly.  Also for every state in India we must have a nuclear power plant as that will ensure cheaper electricity for a large consumer base.
0 1 Dear Prime Minister ji,
I know entire world will chase you down like land bill if you introduce the compulsory surrender of LPG subisidy by all MP, MLA, MLC (present as well as past) and class-1 Officers (Centre as well as State).
But, i know you can do it also.
Regards

1 0 I WISH TO PUT FORWARD MY PERSONAL OPINION ON GAS SUBSIDY, I REQUEST OUR PRIME MINISTER TO CUT THE GAS SUBSIDIES FOR ALL CLASS ONE EMPLOYEES OF GOVERNMENT SECTOR,SEMI GOVT SECTOR, PRIVATE SECTOR/OR PUT ONE INCOME SLAB UPTO WHICH SUBSIDY CAN BE GIVEN, WITH THIS WE CAN SAVE SUBSTANCIAL AMOUNT OF GOVT ACCOUNT
0 1 Use bicycles as far as possible in our daily life & use vehicle on need/actual basis, so that petroleum products consumption will reduce. Explore possibilities of getting oil from our nation itself & don't depend on others. Once we are self dependent on these, the rates of daily consumables like food, tptn., etc. will reduce automatically.  For saving of our India Mother, we have to explore and use minimum petroleum products.
0 1 actually there is a tax rebate given for those coming on 4 wheelers upto rs. 1.5 lakhs which can be reduced and encourage the people to use public transports and tax incentives to be given to them instaed of giving to those using 4 wheelers. if you promote tax incentive for 4 wheeler owners, definitely we have to forget conservation.
0 1 This is  on voluntary withdrawal of Gas Subsidy. We can very well embrace the social media to encourage people to  spread the message "IDoNotNeedSubsidy" and the saved amount can be passed on to one of social cause like  "Child Education" or "BetiPadhaoBetiBachao". Also total registered Number counter and amount saved can be displayed in the prominent website which will encourage people to better the number.
0 1 My suggestion is regarding cooking gas cylinders delivered to home. Why not the govt. devise a new plan for consumers to pay online for a cylinder delivered to homes. The PAHAL scheme is a welcome one. But there are no plans to pay the cost of the cylinder online. The consumer can now book a cylinder online and can know the status of the booking, cash transfer and delivery, but he has to pay only by cash during delivery. This results in overcharging by delivery boys which is a burden to consumer
0 1 Mr N Modi, if the govt can create more awareness for people to save petrol will facts at figures it will make a huge difference. E.g. If you put sign boards and banners at all signals showing that if each person turns of their vehicle for 30seconds it can save upto X amount of fuel per vehicle, so imagine all of India turning their vehicles off at each signal? They will be thousands of litres of fuel saved daily and a lot of air pollution will also reduce. Try this out and see the difference.
0 1 I think that PM Mr. Narendra Modi Should initiate a program "Cycle(bicycle) Chalao - Paryavarn Bachao Abhiyan" and encourace people of india to ride bicycle for a small distance.This small step has a wide impact,it saves petrol/diesel and also save enviourment.Please look into the matter.Thanks
0 0 Solar energy devices should be subsidized to encourage usage and bring down installation & running cost. Also all building more than 2 floors to mandatorily have solar heater installation for clearance of building plan
1 0 Why should Union Govt Cabinet, MP gets continious cheap state power when I have to pay 4/5 time the price to get 24*7 power through diesel genset
2 0 FM Sir, I think it is not only time to set precedence, like you have opted out for LPG Subsisy, but make it mandatory through law to future MP, PM and minister not to avail such. Strcitly go by your own principle for Pay for What you use for all services. So that mistake like by Previous of govt and current Delhi govt of free power , waiver of loan is never done in future for vote bank politics.
1 0 Respected PM, its regarding LPG subsidy chodo abhiyan.
First let the MPs and MLAs should leave there subsidy on LPG and the food serve on Parliament and also all bureaucrats/Government servant who is in on higher band should mandatory leave the subsidy. If all of you employees of Government of India include state government employee leave there subsidy then our 5-7% target is easily achievable and good message to public will go and the result more people like me will definitely join this event.
0 0 Upgrade the public transportation system. Public transportation should cost very low so that everyone can afford and should have the good facilities(so that even the rich should favor it). Don't worry about the losses because in long term if more people use the public transportation there will be savings on subsidized fuel, as the fuel consumption falls.
0 0 pm sir subsidy yojana ko vistar dijiye hum jaise lower middle class or upper middle class ke liye swechha se subsidy chhod sake to usme subsidy ka 50%,25% tak ka bhi vikalp ho to lakho pariwar shamil honge jo desh hit me rahega.

0 0 Reduce Diesel consumption by creating hybrid with renewable energy. Possibly take punitive action against over populating of SUVs which are Diesel & Petrol guzzlers. Popularize hybrid & Electric vehicles.Metro rail should be facilitated more for urban mass transport.Create Cycle tracks in city planning.Facilitate City Gas (LPG) in piping distribution with accurate overall consumption monitoring .Exploit more for natural gas at North East region of india, stop gas flares
0 0 Sir, It has been observed that apartments , areas, fully charged with PNG have families who have not switched to PNG. It should be made mandatory for PNG charged area to have Piped gas and LPG cylinders and subsidies stopped immediately. It should be made mandatory. I was appalled to see LPG cylinders in my society which has been charged and has PNG users for over four years.
0 0 sir , all indians if want to save oil & gas  there is no power to destory the  fossile  fuel .i request all the  indians  every body  have  a mood to save oil & gas.if  you use the oil & gas like your blood then it must be conserved
0 0 I think we need to restrict the use of Govt Vehicle for defence and other civil authorities by restricting the allotement of fule to those authorities....bcz one normal officer is using avarage 3 vehicle for him...his wife and for chieldrens......we should think about it.
0 0 This will help in saving huge diesel requirement and huge saving to govt. solar & bio gas stove at villages will save kerosene consumption in turn help villagers to save money.  2. Govt to derisk of procuring oil from few countries.  Usage of ETHANOL with petrol & diesel has to take off in big scale which will help the farmers/industries. This will help the govt in the oil bill payment. What was said in the election time should be implemented it shouldn't be a speech during elections.
0 0 India can be super power if we manage 3 things...1. Fuel (petrol/diesel etc.) 2. Dollar price 3. population growth... Fuel: India has to invest/explore huge oil reserves from NE/Rasjasthan/J&K/Assam & from both the oceans (Indian/Arabian). Govt has to support farmers in cultivating JATROPA Plants to produce Bio fuel. We have untapped resources this needs urgent attention both from Govt & private companies to explore oil. We need to move towards converting all our railway line electrified
0 0 Now a days we are hearing good news that cow slaughtering is stopping in most of Indian states. And we can use these resources to generate Bio gas from cow dung and make bio gas fuel and Electricity from that bio gas. And best part is that final product we will get as a good organic fertilizer which can be use to make organic farming. And these way we can reduce fuel cost and chemical fertilizer and pesticides. Bonus is that we will get organic foods.
0 0 The only way to save fuel for future generation is to IMPROVE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT FACILITIES. People should be made feel like public transport facilities are CHEAPER, SAFER & FASTER.
0 0 I saw all these big advertisement on conservation of fuels,saving energy. But do we really care about saving such valuable resources? I found the answer to above question as a big NO when I saw bigger ads on fuel stations about giving these valuable and lasting   energy resources, free of cost. Eg. 1000 ka petrol bharwao air saal bhar free petrol paane ka mauka pao. Also we have encouraged people not to save but use more fuels. We are not in a state to encourage people for spending more on fuel.
0 0 Dear sir,
Instead of using fossil fuels can we not use bio fuels.recently scientists in Bangalore have demonstrated a prototype to generate gas using vegetable oil, water and solar power in a reactor.  Half a kg of cooking is sufficient to cook food for 20days for a family. Can we not use such technology and reduce dependence on fossil fuel so that india has alternative solution.
0 0 Oil & Gas we are get from dead and decaying digging compost. For example:We are getting coal in Andhra Pradesh & T.S from Singarini Mines by digging the coal in this process so many people are dieing by falling into it.....
So why to kill a human for conserving petro chemical products my opinion is to use Solar Products. It help us for saving environmental pollution.
As petro chemical products are not renewable products so we should give them less priority when compared to solar products.
0 0 Dear sir,
every second, day by day and every year we are using fuels for our own use and it become costly and deficient therefore, i request the govt to use Ethanol to mix in fuel like other countries using.
0 0 Each and every construction sites made after cutting green belt then each and all terrace of construction sites used with put solar cell and government should make public interest to use public transport instead of bikes and cars. And government should provide public transport facility within city area to subsidized and covered every area to prevent personnel vehicle use. and Government is action to make low cost and modern designed bicycle or electric scooters ect.
0 0 every drop of petrol and diesel should be conserved.A lot of it is wasted at each and every petrol pump in fuelling bikes scooties etc at the time of finishing fuel .5 to 30 drops is wasted in single fuelling.Now coount no of vehicles multiply by no of petrol pumps in india.It is a personal experience.new technology is required for fuelling and patience is also required by both parties.
0 0 Also, re furnishing of roads should be speed up not only highways but large internal roads in the cities needs to be re-furnished. Sir strict road rules - like speed limits, lane driving is the biggest need of the hour now, parking, better roads will ultimately lead to the fuel saving and the fiscal deficit of the country will surely will reduce.
I request govt should speed up these project, we know your target is 30kms per day, but give instruction to state govt. for internal city roads.
0 0 Dear Sir,
After the sudden death of Late Sh. Gopinath Munde, our Rural Infra, Highway Minister Mr Gadkari said new Motor Vehicle act will implemented in 3 months. I wonder no steps have been have in these months. Why govt. is taking so long to implementing such rules as it will benefit govt. only in the long run. 
We all Indians nature is resistant to change. so if you apply few strict rules it will take easily 2-3 years to everybody follow these rules.
0 0 What Can Not be avoided is the need of fuel for Logistic works of all nature but by being strict with "Bharat Stage III & IV" standard and removing 100% of non-compliance Vehicle will help in both limiting Air Pollution and Fuel Consumption. Further the Most effective way is to improve Traffic by developing City Roads/highways such as to minimize number of Signals faced on any particular Route.
0 0 Sir, make a govt. organisation also like Indian railways, Life Insurance co. all public sectors, dept like public transport company, in distributing petrol. so that any sources people get fuel. Fuel must be free from all restrictions. And one more idea is state transport like central govt transport also can make poeple comfort. Open more and more agency like HP,IOL, BP,in states like karnatake oil co, Delhi oil co, Andra oil co, Rajstan oil co, etc. to easy reach people.
0 0 Request to authority concern to encourage for electrical bike (battery operated vehicle).I was riding yo bike ( battery operated vehicle) but forced to stop due to non availability of services by manufacturer in city like INDORE (MP)due non supportive attitude of govt in the matter.
hope govt would promote & facilitate to manufacturer of battery operated vehicles

0 0 This policy change should be done as early as possible so that run for efficient engine may start soon.
Kar ke to dekho.
it would give boost to auto sector,increased revenue due to higher sale,increased employment so more income tax.
Govt won't loose anything but greater revenue collection.
0 0 Conservation is a dynamic activity n v should focus on every field accordingly.
The base of tax n duties on automobile should be on capacity and fuel consumption of engine not on length n ground clearance.
A sedan with 1200cc engine is costlier than a hatchback with 1500cc engine due to length.Funny!
If this policy changes, a run will start 4 more efficient engines n ppl would get comfortable vehicles at less price.

0 0 I would suggest to evaluate 'Day light saving time'. This will allow different parts of the country -- East & West, to work more and utilize the full light during the day. If possible, use multiple time zones as observed in Australia. This will impact hugely in long run.
0 0 Finding more oil sources will help us in reducing money spent on oil import and petrol/diesel prices in our country, but this will encourage more vehicles on roads and more pollution. I am not saying we should stop exploring oil sources hidden in our country, but giving more priority for change to alternate sources is a must in current situation
Organizing proper public transports, proper planning of cities and using environment friendly energy sources will be a long term solution.
0 0 Govt should start investing in huge scale on Solar and Electric powered transport. Hope everyone is getting aware of facts that Delhi has become most air polluted city in India. This will be same for other cities of India in few years.
0 0 The main usage of petrol is in metro cities.And in all major metro cities like mumbai roads are dug up at least 4 to 6 months in a year which cause major traffic jams.This leads to more of petrol and diesel consumption.Govt should solve this problem by strict code of conduct on digging and maintain ace of roads.

0 0 70% of fuel consumption for propelling vehicles can be saved by running roads, themselves, with aid of electricity preferable wind & solar power. There will be no pollution; No raod, rail accidents. Oil import will be reduced, drastically. Pl refer world patent 1086/MUM/2012 at Sr.No. 30503 Indian Patent journal dt 06-12-2013. Will be cost effective since work done by millions of vehicle engines will be done by fewer electrical machines; & work by burning fuels will be done by electricity.
0 0 Dear Sirs,
Fuel cons are the area which will enable us save upto 20% fuel costs. Magnetized fuel high pressure pipes(non ferrous material) will help to burn almost 98% of burning of fuel inside engine cylinder. Railways and Shipping Corpn. Can start pilot projects to achieve this standards. By investing little amount will yeild huge profits only in fuel consumption. Added advantage in increased life of spare parts and less emission gives us clean environment. Willing to join hands with govt.

0 0 OGCF- I think bio diesel may best solution. Australia making bio diesel from sugar can and America making from corn. Battery operated vehicles should develop that can be easy way to replace oil and gas. Battery can recycle up to 70% after death. So it can cheaper and easy way to replace oil and gas. We should require battery booth in many places just like petrol pump and it will create huge new job and business opportunities. Also pollution level from vehicles will decrease.
0 0 Save Oil - Be Healthy. For covering short distances, use bicycle. Govt may reduce taxes on cycles and make suitable arrangements for safe parking. With public participation, authorities should encourage cycling in India as being practiced in China.
0 0 Exploration of SHALE oil in India should be considered.
1 0 Importance to electric cars should be given.  Some cities in the world like Paris have pledged to get rid of desiel cars by 2020.  India should do the same for its most polluted cities like DELHI. Will help reduce OIL imports and reduce pollution.

Unlike plastic recycling which creates harmful by products and does not remove plastic load on this earth; this process converts plastic into degradable useful products without creating or using any harmful chemicals.

0 0 3) Focused investments into battery technology to improve battery life. This will help us switch from fuel vehicles to electricity driven vehicles quicker and with no compromise in quality. Right now, high cost of battery replacement is driving users from purchasing electric vehicles. A "cars exchange scheme" can be started for people to exchange old cars (>15 years old) with electric cars.This will give initial push and get polluting cars off the road replacing them with clean cars.
0 0 2) All government canteens, defence campuses, universities, schools and other bulk generators of wet waste should switch to biogas to cook with input feed of ever available wet waste, leftover food and garden waste. This will provide import substitution for LPG saving us billions of dollars. Appropriate subsidies can be given and unemployed youth can be trained to maintain these plants as many have shut down for lack of proper maintenance.
0 0 1) To save auto fuel, every signal compulsorily should have timers which signal to the road user how much time is left till the signal turns green, thus he can switch off his vehicle.

 i from gujarat, in gujarat the use of cng in four Wheeler car is almost 75% but the GOVERNMENT OF GUJARAT and GSPC jointventure is not able to open GAS service Station more . as you know that The capacity of cng tank is 200 km. so much line on gas station and waste of time of people.
    i requested to prime minister to look into matter for use of cng by people more but cng station makes in large way and allow to people to open friendly business policy to start cng station.
thanks..
0 0 HOW DO UBER & OLA GIVE MUCH LOWER TAXI RATES THAN OTHERS & STILL PAY DOUBLE SALARY TO DRIVERS (i.e. Rs.40-50,000 AS OPPOSED TO Rs.20,000).ONE OBVIOUS REASON IS THAT THEY CHARGE VERY LESS COMMISSION-THEY ARE ONLY AGGREGATORS.ANOTHER POSSIBLE REASON IS THAT THEIR DAILY MILEAGE MUST BE DOUBLED OR TRIPLE DUE TO FACT THAT APP ENABLES CONNECTING PASSENGERS & TAXIS. ALSO, CUSTOMERS PREFER THEM DUE TO LEAST COST, BEST & EFFICIENT SERVICE & MORE SECURITY FEATURES.SIMILAR EFFICIENT MODEL MUST BE COPIED.

So we have to guide our countryman in proper way how to save fuel? 1)By using bicycle 2)Go by walk for short distance 3)Use the vehicle if it very much necessary 4)For political persons they will go by prestige(use of private  helicopter,private flight etc etc) 5)Don't go for opening ceremony (for eg one state to other in separate flight with their security,assistants) Like this think before spending unnecessary fuel
0 0 Plastic bags is a major concern. People need something apart to reduce the use of plastic bags.But there should be some replaceable thing which can be used in lieu of plastic bags. Since some things in the market cannot be brought by paper bags or craft bags. So bags made of cellulose can be an outcome for the problem. The government can direct the plastic bag producing industries to make bio-degradable plastic like bags made of cellulose instead of producing plastic or polythene bags.
0 0 Why not the government minimise 100% use of petroleum and impose the use of gasoline in all forms of transportation vehicles. Since the price of pure ethanol is much less as compared to petrol so it can be a great step ahead for a sustainable livelihood with conservation of petroleum products. The government should also request the auto-mobile industries to facilitate such features in new vehicles. Also the use of biomass as fuel is also a great mark for conservation.
0 0 Polythene ban : this is also very dangerous problem arising in India, many times govt imposed such bans but nobody following these bans.

1 0 How to give up subsidized gas? Currently there is no option to buy the gas cylinder without subsidy. Even though I can afford to pay full price, the gas agency is asking me to get aadhar etc and make me fall into the subsidy trap. Please tell oil marketing companies to have the option of non-subsidized cylinder for domestic use readily available, and for paying full market price. Also make it easy to get this full price cylinder without the hassle of aadhar etc.

1 0 Restricting the number of cylinders will jeopardise the family system. Me, my wife and child prefer to live with my parents so that they will not feel lonely. As such there are more number of members. Just for the sake of getting separate gas connection should I leave my parents and live separate ? Therefore allot number of subsidised cylinders on the basis of number of members in the household.
1 0 Even the non aadhar form compells us to give an undertaking that we will be obtaining aadhar. Is this not cheating the public as well as hoodwinking the Supreme Court ? STOP AADHAR SAVE INDIA. Why are you particular to get Aadhar enrolment done through private agencies ? Just to enable sharing with foreign govs ? Are we not justified in questioning the bonafides ?
2 0 What about the wastage of fuel by government officers ? For eg: The district collector, RDO and other officials travel to the same destination and back by different vehicles contemporaneously. Should they not be having pool vehicles ? OR should they not use the same vehicles. Officers feel it infra-dig to travel with subordinates. That mindset should be corrected. Likewise the fuel allowed for personal use of government vehicles should be taxed as a part of salary package.

2 0 Thus , I can just say that replacement of Solar energy and Liquid Hydrogen with Oils & Gases will lead not only in reduction in use of Oil & Gases ( ultimately conservation reserves ) but also reduces the Import of INDIA which may result in increase of value of Indian Rupee as compare to US Dollar
2 0 Similarly, Government as well as public should take initiative to set up solar panels and bio/ gobar gas plant in each house or each society for domestic consumption. While in each Government Building, Government should set solar panel to meet the energy requirement of government building. Similarly, in other commercial buildings, the owner should set up a solar panel. Moreover, Government can use water to produce liquid Hydrogen for meeting requirement of Oils and Gases .
2 0 Dear PM, I have an important & urgent suggestion about GOOD GOVERNANCE DAY, which is to be observed on December 25, the birthday of ATALBIHARI BAJPAYEE, our past PM. I think oberving a day for good governance will not serve much purpose. Instead please declare a period of one month starting on 25 Dec as GOOD GOVERNANCE MONTH. During the month all Govt and SemiGovt Depts should focus on reforming their working, procedures, accounting to improve efficiency and eliminate wasteful activities.
1 0 oil and gas resources are very limited. It is required to take steps not only to reduce the wastage but also to reduce burden of consumption on oil and gas resources by using alternative resources of energy that we use to consume from oil and gases .  We use petrol in vehicles , so instead of it the government as well as automobile company should take initiative for making vehicles that run on electrical energy of battery that should be charged with sun light using solar cell on its outer body.

0 0 2.	In Government Sectors vehicles are used roughly and miss use of fuel is done here in respect of private vehicle as the driver or the person who uses the vehicle does not refill fuel from his pocket.  As the government pays it does not bothers them whether the fuel is getting wasted or not.  Gov should limit the vehicle usage accordingly and maintain the vehicles as per order.
0 0 3.	In terms of electricity saving at least government offices can use solar system for lighting which will not cost much and can reduce the electric bill and save energy
0 0 4.	Government can encourage the Stadium authorities to use their roof for solar panels so that electricity can be used from solar energy and whenever games are not on they can supply electricity to emergency services such as hospitals, fire brigades, police stations etc.

Large companies like Infosys, TCS etc. should be asked to make residential accommodation available for their employees in the vicinity of offices, to avoid wastage of both fuel and time. Much can be studied from the townships of Steel Plants (I worked for 32 years), and also factories like BHEL etc. We should also get rid of traffic jams.
1 0 Lima Environmental meeting of nations just concluded...Our right to enjoy the benefits of technology, luxury, development, etc. is ok ...but at what cost? Unless there is a scare of INDIVIDUAL/MASSpunishment we do not feel obliged to even accept our own acts of guilt committed in broad day light. We shall conserve only when there is immediate scare of loosing this comfort forever.
Therefore, let only the best and most fuel efficient technology be allowed to do business in our contry.

1 0 Petrol sales should have a system like that of electricity tariff. Every house or individual should be given some liters of petrol at a minimum cost. If they demand for more they should be provided with petrol with extra tax which may encourage them to use public transportation system and save fuel consumption.
1 0 The following activities can be undertaken to emphasize the importance of oil and gas conservation during the forthcoming fortnight:
(1) Prepare a list of methods of conservation and advertise it through newspaper ads, TV ads, radio ads, banners at public places etc.
(2) Organize contests for school and college students on the theme. The contests can be drawing, poster, quiz and even poetry recital.
1 0 Use of mass transportation. Cars should be banned at busy areas of various cities and public transportation must be developed. People driving cars with minimum number of people should be made to pay tax so that they also use public transport.

0 2 #1. In India some of stupid and nonsense peoples keeping many vehicles one for son, one for daughter one for wife, one for other son........and so on. Kindly prevent such type of stupid royalist.
#2. Stop all the outdated cars and other vehicles.
#3. Closed all those industries who do not follow rule and regulation of manufacturing process.
0 0 There are more passengers than taxis. So let some shuttle taxis may be introduced to conserve oil. Same amount of fuel can take 4 passengers can take four passengers. Car pool can save oil and create business for individuals.  If 5 and 1/2 working days are replaced by 5 days a week in most offices, much petroleum can be conserved. For half day's work so much wastage must be avoided.
1 0 i think in india also there is no lack of  petrolium and gas ,, bt in india there is lack of research industry in this sector only few of engineering college presently research in this industry so it is obvious when demand is high then we have dependent to import ,,  so i think that is a time for indian government to thinking about opening new research centre and institute in this sector like iit

0 0 Dear sir
At local level, I have seen that on Delhi Gurgaon Expressway, jam occurs if a single vehicle breaks down, people do not know whom to call. Simple solution can be to make arrangements to tow away vehicles with in 4- 5 minutes if towing vehicles are deputed at designated at certain points and a lot of fuel can be saved. Also there must be some well published telephone no. To which need for tow away can be intimidated. it will save few lacs Rs worth fuel/day and few thousand manhours also

0 0 If we collect and give plastic waste to the government, easily we can convert it to 2.5 billion litres of diesel annually. Do oil and gas authority aware of this simple truth?
0 0 Fossil oil and gas fuels are mainly used for transport and cooking....raise taxes on these fuels and use the money to help electric vehicles.
For cooking fuels raise prices of LPG cylinders so that people are discouraged to cook at home....people should eat in restaurants most of the time....for that opening restaurants in every nook and corner of towns and cities should be encouraged....corrupt municipal employees who harass these businesses should be flogged in public

0 0 infrasturcture and good motorable road and use of e bikes  zero duty and sales tax on e bikes and batteries for it is a must in china 7 out of every 10 bukes on the road is a e bike
0 0 lpg subisdy is used fraudulently by all dealers without excemption and i am fully aware that lap are sold in black market allow market price immediately and incentives only for poor and medium people and not for rich
0 0 I am totally agree with our finance minister that subsidies are meant only for poor people
0 0 car pools can be encouraged by incentive directly transferred to direct benefit transfer systems
0 0 allow market price for petrol and diesel no subsidies is required.. subsidies are meant for only poor people.  transport disel consumption may create a price increase on essential commodities no problem till rail transport of done properly is the cheapest mode of transport
0 0 car pools by higher officers of central government  in the rank of secretaries, additional/joint/special secretaries, in this fortnight, which will have the effect on the entire babudom surviving on tax payer money like parasits, but not delivering anything substantial on job oriented economic growth of the country.

0 0 To keep the fast track railway infrastructure projects,on line assistance mechanisms may be thought.For example earth/gravel quarry permits by the Government of Tamil Nadu is taking about 6 months to 2 years thus rendering contract management a problem.Besides fast track projects are suffering with time and cost over runs.
2 0 Its a good initiative to have a solar park. But I would suggest one step ahead of this. Why can't there be "Health Park" and 'Solar Park' would be a sub-set of this. Municipal co-operation develops parks in the cities. In place of that think for a "Health Park", having track for morning walk on the outskirt of the garden. Think, if the garden is fenced with Solar and Wind plates. Suppose that in the morning and evening, chanting of ved mantra is continuing. In the mid of the garden there is Ayurvedic garden with plants such as 'Aloevera, Tulsi etc and on the track side there are fruit trees e.g. Mango, Guava, Pomegranate etc. and also trees whose wood can be sold e.g. Shisham, Jaamun, Sagwaan etc. While leaving the garden, People can purchase some items their only.  Also a fish pond in the centre of the park.
Think, in the same garden cultural activity is being performed.
Why we always think and govt. drains crore of rupees on a single task. Why we not think for an integrated approach! A day to day increase of crime is taking place because we are not socially bound together. We try to copy what we see on the TV while in a nearby flat or house, a great artist lives even then we approach TV or film celebrity. Dharm is a universally approach to keep us together but only few narrow minded persons divided us in Hindu or Muslims or in them sub-casts.
At last I would like to write a line of Chankya Sutra, "Sukhasya moolam Dharmah", "Dharmasya moolam Arthah", "Arthasya moolam Rajyam".
1 0 Set up new metro lines in Big Cities. Doubling the current capacity and introducing Airconditoned travel.
1 0 Suggestion for Swach (Clean) India :We must do something about stray animals on the road.We all  are aware about rabies death in India. IN western country people have to go to zoo to see buffalo,cow,elephant,camel,horse but here we can see all these standing in traffic.
0 0 I stay in Mumbai and lots of fuel gets wasted due to inefficient handling of traffic. We should introduce water transport immediately in Mumbai to ease the congestion on roads. Less traffic would mean fuel savings.
1 0 A common man like me is able to coordinate all activities in my family and office. Our government has got lot of manpower and offices to coordinate the activities. It hurts when you see that newly built roads are demolished by irrigation department, telephone department etc. It hurts a lot probably because I am aware that the tax I paid is not being utilized properly. Officers shall be made answerable for their irresponsible activities.Government must take measures to coordinate the activities.
1 0 1.Use of alternate energy for transport 2.Effective planning in managing energy 3.Encourage use of public transport 4.crating awarnes about saving of energy. 5.Adopting life in co-ordination with nature
2 0 Promote the idea of home composting to protect our environment. Nature has got its own way of composting. Let us do the same at home. Mix the kitchen waste with dry leaves, add little bit of curd to promote the growth of micro organisms, leave this in a mud pot which has got lot of holes for promoting air circulation so that aerobic bacteria starts growing and your compost is ready within few months. No smell. Your family, your environment and your plants feels good. Please promote this.sasidhar
2 0 We must make the process of  income tax payment attractive to all. What about providing financial support towards health care for the family of those who pay income tax? The amount that can be routed must be a proportion of the income tax paid  by them in their life time. Jai Hind.
2 0 The earth is our home. We need to preserve our planet for the future generations. We have installed solar multi crystalline panels (4000 watts) at our home 8 months ago to satisfy our desire to preserve the natural resources. This is more than enough for a small family. The distribution board has to be appropriately designed for optimizing the benefits. This is powerful enough to run most of the equipments.I request our government to provide subsidy towards solar inverters beyond1kw also.

0 0 Transport system in India needs  to be ovehauled.Metro rail in Delhi has reduced the pollution. This should be followed  in othet big cities. Shared online Taxi  services  can be introduced to decrease the pollution
0 0 I welcome  these kinds of activities. Why not have competitions on, 1. Best Fuel Oil saver devices for a) 2-wheeler b) four wheelers, individually? 2. Have a competition among Metros on, "No. One Saver on FUEL on a predeclared competition-day", wherein public will be encouraged to use public transport? -(ON a working day!) 3.Let Metros &Tier1, 2 cities declare designated streets free of motor-vehicles for ONE FULL WEEK-to show how much FUEL conserved. 4. States can award Best performing Depts
1 0 it is better to abolish practice of giving conveyance allowances in metro cities. Instead bus passes may be issued to the staff to encourage them to use public transport. We should also encourage peoples to use bicycles inplace of cars and two wheelers. the sale of diesel cars shall be discouraged by imposing high environmental taxas these are the most polluting vehicles.
1 0 In metro cities, add 10,000 new buses (half of them AC) and provide timely service with excellent connectivity. No standees in AC buses. 2 running personal cars consume area on road equal to 1 bus, but carry only 4 people at peak hours against 40 in a bus, ie 10 times road space. They add to traffic troubles, wasted fuel and added pollution. Car owners prefer outsourcing their driving effort if excellent service is available. Have peak-hour peak-direction surcharge for AC buses to make viable.
0 0 Adopting simple practices go a long way in conserving fuel resources in the long run though may not be directly connected, as all products need some fuel to be manufactured and processed. If all of us use the recycle -reuse mantra in our daily lives it will make a big difference on our demands put on imported fuel resources. Unfortunately the mantra is not put into practice in our daily lives and is only thought of as the responsibility of commercial industries.
0 0 1-In offices and other institutes where office works make use of printers, a culture should be adopted to use double side printing of paper rather printing on single side to minimize paper /ink/energy wastage. 2- employees and employers should use their own coffee or tea mugs to reduce use of plastic cups wherever possible. 3- old culture of drinking in mud cups should be revived.4- simple practices as use of pressure cooker for cooking against open containers reduces gas-use to a large extent
1 0 All man-made products should be numbered to the recyclable category they belong. Such recycling numbers would help determine the material of the product and hence its recycling procedure for re-use. Plastic cups, wrappers, glass containers, storage boxes all should be labelled. People need to be educated about this as well so that they know which products are recyclable. Recycling products can help minimize cost to consumers and keep the demand down for processing new products.
0 0 agriculture and commercial buildings should make use of alternate sources of energy such as solar and wind energy putting less demand on petroleum fuels. Subsidies in alternate energy sectors might help make the shift. industries can apply the recycle-reuse mantra for less fuel consumption.
0 0 motivate / educate people use more of public transport. restrict vehicles in certain streets,limit reg without parking place provision.what ever  limitations on car manufacturing is minimal compare to ;arger interest.
0 0 Should be fill full tank of Petrol/Diesel in your Vehicle. It makes Good Average of the Vehicle. If in the tank, the air is less, it make oil conservsation
0 0 A fencing should be done on the boundary of the river ganges. Only at some places fence should be opened for people. It will help you to protect our mother river.
0 0 Create Awareness to Student and parents to use cycle at least twice a week.

1 0 all secretaries, special secretaries, additional secretaries, joint secretaries in central ministries/departments and equivalent in CPSEs, statutory/constitutional bodies, should be asked to come in office in shared official vehicles. if this is done it will motivate all lower officers to follow it. secondly, there should be reduced rates of petrol/diesel for those cars which are running in car pool system. this will reduce traffice and fuel consumption
0 0 RACE2-INFINITY shall not be our Aim, Our Villages must be protected, Familiy culture culture shall be encouraged --- use of Oxen + rearing cows shall be encouraged-- Pass-on the financial benefit to farmers using Bullock Cart+ Animal Draft= giving Cow-Dung-Manure+ Bio Gas,Our Soil will loose fertility--without cowdungManure+ Joint Family culture is ending --Same must be re-established by Incometax Benefit & Financial benefit to Village HBL & use of tractors for farming shall be discouraged -
1 0 Corporate social responsibility Under the companies act should be used in reducing oil and gas consumption. It should put forward many ways for the reduction of consumption of oil and gas. Credits can be given in the line of carbon credits for not using this much amount of oil and gases under a period.Investing in the production of renewable energy for electricity and for automobile fuels should also be brought under CSR.

0 0 More researches should be conducted to develop and use thorium as a nuclear fuel instead of uranium.India has abundant sources for thorium at Kerala coast.Lack in researches are still the deadlock for thorium instead of Uranium. This will help in stopping import of uranium and also is ore safer fuel.The promotion of available nuclear fuels within the country will help in reducing consumption of oil and gases and also saving Forex reserves.

0 0 1.Automobile Manufacturers' domestic and export sales should be such that the manufacturers, after meeting their own import bills, should earn foreign exchange through overseas sales in such a way that their export realisations can meet with the import bills of Petrol and Diesel in respect of vehicles sold in the domestic market. 2. Active life of the vehicles be reduced and fuel efficient vehicles be supported by the Government.3."Off the Road", one day per week be introduced but for emergency
2 0 40% of fuel cost is in transport sector. subsidise industry engage in manufacturing hybrid car,cabs,TwoWheelers so that fuel import bill is reduced. Increase tax on fuel guzzlers vehicles more than 1000cc engines.Good roads will cut down fuel cost by over10%.pursuade people to use pubic transport by imposing parking charges for large SUV as surcharge. public transport is to be effecient,economical&cheap to persuade people to move.
4 0 Private companies and Government departments and offices should make it a rule that the employees should not use private vehicles once in a week. They should be encouraged to use public transport services or bicycles if they are staying nearby.For that efficient public transport system should be provided.
1 0 More exploration for shale gas will be helpful in reducing the use of oil and gas. The dependence on  OPEC should be reduced and other renewable sources should be found out.
0 0 The use of ethanol as automobile fuel should be promoted. As India is the second largest producer of sugarcane after Brazil this option will boost the agricultural community also. We can save more Forex reserves and also reduce the consumption of oil and gas. There by emissions are also reduced. Brazil had shown a good example of using ethanol in their public transport systems.India should follow and make use of this renewable source of energy.
1 0 Bicycle riding should be encouraged and use of uncooked food should be encouraged to save fule and gas.
2 0 CITY LIMIT SHOULD IMPLEMENT ELECTRICAL MOTOR WITH SOLAR CHARGING. THE SOLAR CHARGING SHOULD BE IN ALL PARKING AREA.
3 0 CYCLE AT HOME CAN SAVE 20 % OF FUEL CONSUMPTION WITH HANDLING 5KM radius OF INDIVIDUAL HOME. PROPER ROUTE SHOULD BE PROVIDED FOR CYCLE RIDING.
1 0 Banning the advertisement of automobile companies will help in barring auto sales as is in case of Liquor. Although decontrol of fuel is a good step but the Root cause should be eliminated.
0 0 No one looked towards the pace automobile companies are selling their products with luring advertisments. In November 2014 alone 1.56 lakh cars and 8.53 lakh motorcycles were sold in India. Are they running on water?  Are the roads multiplying at this pace?  Is there need for so much vehicles? Even school going kids possess motor cycle and scooter can't even they use a bicycle. Three cars in one home can be very easily seen. Earlier police used to petrol on cycles giving plenty time in the beat.
0 1 "New activities"'judicious use of petroleum'.Petroleum diesel kerosene are used in household of urban areas mostly-To conserve our limited stock available for longer time in faith to upcoming generation(s), like Conserving our Honesty Health family welfare at the worse stages of life sequences ...Energy conservation is prime duty as it will result into prosperous happiest beginning with our society than nearby than far away locations also.
0 1 We can provide subsidy on purchase of petrol and diesel. Private vehicles can be issued cards which will provide them monthly subsidy on certain quantum of usage of petrol/diesel. Any usage above that quantum will be charged higher than the market rate. This will induce the private vehicle owners to use their vehicles less. This is also be very useful since people take their vehicles out even if they need to travel only a short distance.
