11 6 Is Modi Govt. really want Incredible India? Just see the attached file where I asked PMO to have a check on the un-necessary high FEE charged by the schools whereas the teachers were not paid salary as per CBSE norms. CBSE reply is attached. It just seems protecting the culprits and closing the case without any grievance redressal. PMOs online grievance mechanism is of no use and the grievances were not taken seriously and it's for making Indian public fool.Will this platform do something?
10 1 My Suggestion - In Mumbai lots of fly overs and Railway bridges are made in last 10 to 15 years but none of them is painted so all look ugly and also it is getting damaged early due to environmental forces. Why they are not painted or why they are not included in the tenser technical Conditions ? it will look esthetic too !! it must be mendetory for all elivated structures all over India.
2 1 Historically, all countries, when they were achieving serious growth, there was no labor unrest. Those were the times where there was some untold understanding between the working class and the higher ups. The workforce was disciplined.
Tourism has the potential to add sustained plentiful GDP points.
Disciplined and focused 'Tourist friendly Service providers' is the need of the day.
Our history and geography has so much to offer to the guests, if only our people do their part.
10 0 If the 'Swatcha Bharat' initiative becomes a way of life in the tourist spots and the transport hubs, one box is ticked.
Then, ticking the second box 'athidi devo bhava' is tougher. Just TV ads won't do. The people who interact with visitors (from officials to autowallahs) must be given a crash course, after which a card saying he/she is a tourist friendly service provider. They must also be further sensitized on a continuous basis.
Do this and publicize this, the visitors will 'Double'.

0 0 Dear Sir please have a look towards road connectivity I come from a small district called Gonda in UP . The worst condition I have ever seen of the roads in this part of UP . almost no roads .
0 0 Also roads in Tirupati will be just smaller,full traffic,also no proper plantation of trees,water projects & in particular most of regions of AP right now it's Kurnool,Anantapur,Ongole,Chittoor west are facing water problems.So Siddheswaram project we need.Also water should be stored.And atlast to increase tourism,in personal I feel trains should come, for me these trains- Tirupati-Varanasi,Tirupati-Dwaraka since people of AP love Kashi,Dwaraka.These trains can cover most AP regions that's why.
0 0 Sir,if I tell about tourism sector in AP,really there is much.But there are some problems.For example,I will take Tirupati as an example which attracts more tourists due to more locations & pilgrimage centre.But speaking truth,it is facing several problems such as CONGESTION in railway platforms(no increment of platforms just 5-train will halt so much time in nearby premises,proper growth isn't there,Smuggling I needn't to tell(no trench nor manufacturing nor research nor stoppage),still many..

This is my sincere request to consider my thoughts on Public Transportation facility within our smart Cities.I would suggest that it should be Completely Free for all people staying in those cities. All expenses of public transport should be managed by applying PT Tax to all corporate companies as well as all commercial establishments(restaurants/malls/small scale industries/shops etc.) based on each employee working with them. Please think over this suggestion.

0 0 Honble' P.M. Sir your constituency has great potential for cultural TOURISM. I HAVE SPENT MY YOUNGER AGE IN VARANASI. SARNATH IN VNS IS A GREAT PLACE AND IS CONNECTED TO VNS RAILWAY STATION. FROM TOURISM POINT OF VIEW A MONORAIL/TOY-TRAIN IS REALLY GOOD IDEA BETWEEN VARANASI JUNCTION TO SARNATH STATION.
0 0 HISTORICAL TOURISM SUGGESTION: India's unique strength is its great history. We can use it to boost our international and domestic tourism. Govt can invite tenders on PPP basis to develop a village per kingdom within its area to present history in all glory. The village should be developed to showcase all aspects of the kingdom including palace, popular wars (field), capital, a village, etc, and sell artefacts of those times by local craftsmen. Apart from earning a lot, it can employ villagers.
0 0 Planting a tree can provide job to many people as well as source of income to Government. This can be used alternate way for "Clean India Mission". So many things are inter-related to One Idea. Hope some one from the Modi govt will contact me for more details.
0 0 Why can't the Govt Initiate a plan to plant a tree at every Individual house or apartment? If one  house plant one different kind of fruit tree at their premises and care for It, Within 5 to 10 Years down the lane they can see lot of differences in their lives. I have a very good plan to make this idea a grand success, which will make people take it as challenge to grow a tree. Which even gives India a beautiful environment, beautiful future. If Govt really interested Please let me know.

0 0 Yes Tourism industry can boost our economy as it affects people at all the levels. One thing I would like to state that government should focus on reducing travel fare especially of Railway,as most of the people afford to travel by Railway. Hike in fare of Railway tickets impacted the frequency of travelling of people. Its been more than a year since Railway hiked the fare yet there is nothing benevolent for common people. Fare of General & Sleeper coaches should be reduced to promote tourism.

0 0 I just watched your 18th edition of "Mann ki Baat" and you covered for promoting Indian tourism.Yes, our country is far behind in tourism as compared to the world But has the one of the highest potential of developing it.It is just that we are not able to tap that potential.In my attachment I have few suggestions to boost our toursim.

I was even more impressed with the warmth and affection of the locals, who were kind, helpful and welcomed us with a lot of heart. The purity of the nature was the most striking aspect. I have shared my experiences with all my friends and have requested them to visit Kashmir once

0 0 Public sector employees only exhibit "baap ka mal hai " attitude; unless they are companies and can be wound up there should be no public sector in most areas except where loss is the norm and strategy is the basis.It can be that government is a shareholder but never the business/commercial manager as it only promotes corruption--as in banks; public sector banks have failed to give credit to small and poor and reach out to unbanked;this is the case in all areas where govt runs business
0 0 Prime Minister Narendra Modi gives lots of emphasis on travelling and tourism. That's a good spirit and I support it fully. If the PM wants that every Indian should travel to the length and breadth of the magnificent country cqalled then he should take drasticsteps to make it very, very convenient and affordable. As of today tourism is not affordable; hotels are costly, good foood is out of reach of common man, local conveyance is neither affordable not honest and travel cost too is quite high.

In one and half KM stretch of Highway where the city is situated there are hundreds of liquor shops and Petrol Bunks and both these are sandwitched by cracker shops.  A small spark will destroy the entire area as all these are situated abetting each other.  You can collect intelligence reports on this and see another inferno do not occur here.

0 0 I witnessed special compartmemts in our raolways of spevially abled. It was encouraging to see such initiayives. But soon i realized that effort & its purpose had been defeated. Our stations still have overhead bridges to cross over to reach the desired platform to board the trains, no escalators, etc. that could provide easy access to the citizens, senior or young, abled or specially abled. Request our govt to take necessary steps to make this a reality.
0 0 Prince William and Kate's visit to India: PM Modi Ji- people like them should not be allowed to officially visit slums as the British Media follows them everywhere and they show the pics of slums extensively thus defaming India. All our developments in technology like "Mars Mission" get over riden by these pics showing how these people live in shit. Western media loves these pics and we NRI get ashamed infront of our western counterparts. Media makes people believe most Indians live like this.

Thank You,

0 0 Can we do something special and specific this summer to attract huge inflow of tourists in Kashmir. It is the need of hour, people over there do not know how much potential they have to earn money and also praise for their hospitality. Some kind of incentive to people of India (just one for e.g. Tax holiday on the money spent in Kashmir etc)  Also, if this does not harm peace process, tourists may like to take Indian Tricolor and hoist every where in Kashmir.

If we can build infrastructure with magnet repellent,rubberband techniques to pull up the trains and then have the tracks built in a way that it runs on gravity and momentum than we can save a lot of cost,  pollution and traffic.

0 0 Respected sir, I am an NRI who moved to India to set up a factory in Kandla SEZ, Gujrat . The kandla port has just become the first port to cross 100 million ton handling capacity. It is a very important place in India's international trade activity. Still there is no air connectivity from delhi or Mumbai. This is one of the biggest port and to reach kandla takes minimum 5 to 7 hours from delhi. If it becomes easy to reach kandla a lot of international  trade will be easily completed.

0 0 Bharatvarsha from centuries have a rich heritage. But with the time forts,cities, culture etc. were lost. All these can be revived to preserve our incredible heritage for which we are known to the world.These can be done with the participation of private bodies like industries,institutions,citizens,along with the government bodies. We in turn generate employment who will work for the revival.Once done we can showcase as our golden heritage and enhance tourism.

we shd make soccer compulsory in every school on the willingness of students.

0 0 Another way of making country smart is to install the solar panels with consent of all big firms all over nation which are tall towers and they require more electricity also. So by installing solar panels this can be used by same towers in most places like washroom and passage and in cafetarea. so that there will be less electricity as solar energy is free.Usage and this consumption of electricity can be used in village area which is required and this will automatically add to rural development.
1 0 I think we should think about climatic changes nowdays which is leading to humidity and nonseasonal rains and effectng our farmers. Mainly bec of deforestration for building of roads and building. So we should create a plan/LAW where we shd see to it that every builder shd giv some percent of land to greenery in every project and if there is any cut of trees it should be planted in an open grnd in same city. this might make the city more eco friendly and make our air pollution free.
1 0 I see that we have lots of mind and talent in Jail. We have all sort of skilled people in there and their skills are going waste, which can be used to build our nation.
Consider how much money our governments expend on maintenance of government offices towards electrician, plumber, computer operators, carpenters, etc. All government offices should be maintained using prison resources. This will save lots of nation’s money.

0 0 My suggestion for government to develop ropeway transport for our hill areas it help to increase tourism's and safe to travel.
2 0 Maharashtra is a beautiful state, especially during monsoon. Visit a small hill town called 'Panalah' around 35 kms. from Kolhapur. It is indeed a mini Switzerland during monsoon and arguably one of the finest small destinations for a weekend trip. Lovely place within nature. Incredible Panalah...Incredible India!!
0 0 Safe walking,is the need of the hour.To have a sight of Incredible India, the central business districts need to close all traffic, allow only walking freely.
1 0 I visited North East recently in the last week of December.
Gangtok - it was such a nice place, entire city is neat and clean and even the hearts of people also. They are very good.
It's a place one must not miss visiting.
There is a lot to learn.
Each and every individual shows his/her concern for the society which is clearly visible.
They even don't use horns of vehicles unless it is really needed.
And so the place is peace and calm.
0 0 Culture of the particular region also need to be promote before the tourist. The local/folk song/dance and other activities to be displayed to the tourists. this will help the local people and the tourists will also get the information about the place. thus we can also save our ancient and great culture.
2 0 India is the land of diverse culture and amazing natural beauty. North East, and a number of remote place of India enclosing natural beauty in its best. Those area should be promoted in terms of infrastructure, connectivity and advertisement.

1 0 Unless Indian cities get walking friendly and clean air friendly Indians will suffer from diabetes and other lung and throat complications;also unless title (it could be for time slot)for car parking is shown car cannot be bought must be a rule in some cities like Chennai where accident deaths are so high;ranking cities by walker friendliness,environment particulate pollution by area must be necessary
0 1 The Govt under PM Modi is doing great on Macro level. But on Micro level works are not visible. The people in the nation want some thing free gifts from government like free water, laptops, subsidised electricity, cycles, subsidised foods etc etc. Thus the uneducated class and even the s called educated class is not exception. They are least bothered about infrastructure & national security which is prime motive of Govt. To win next election micro level visibility is must.

0 0 * Congress is ruling from the opposition and BJP is failing to counter them in all areas.
* BJP's good work are no where visible on ground, may be i am wrong but you can't demonstrate it like other parties do for just a small work. You need to work for marketing and highlight big your achievements.
0 0 Though I am BJP supporter as a nationalist Indian, Today i writhing this because I feel shame for voting BJP. i felt regret today the way you handled #NITsrinagar cowardly.
* The Deputy CM of JK was shamelessly masking it as Mild Lathi-Charge. which proves that BJP is power hungry party. He has no moral rights to remain deputy CM. we need some tough CM for JK who can deal with PDP and put pressure on them to take tough actions.if you can't turn a small leaf, so better withdraw the support.

Mumbai darshan tour) from Morning to evening we will cover all the tourist places of Mumbai.If this govt give priority to this govt can earn money and same time provide indirect employment in Pvt Travels and Hotels.If we go to Agra we buy show piece Tajmahal, which will create local jobs.

This is about the diamond plant to be set in India. Let it not come at the cost of humongous amount of flora and fauna loss.
Biodiversity, once lost, it is perished forever. No amount of diamonds can restore the flora or fauna to be spent for this. So, I strongly vote to save the biodiversity rather than in making of diamonds.
3 0 Dear beloved PM,
PLEASE DO NOT ACCEPT THE RIO TINTO DIAMOND DEAL. It is going to cost us our greatest wealth, OUR BIODIVERSITY. We need to put our tigers and our natural habitat before diamond mines and everything materialistic. Please do not let them eat a thousand acres of our forests. Please step up against it

1 0 Sir if we can make a cooler water  pump such that pump remains on for 5 minutes and off for next 30 minutes then again on for just 5minutes and off for 30 minutes and so on we can save a huge electricity and water in coming summer season as making pump work for 5minutes is sufficient but we unnecessarily make it work continuously. This will save a huge amount of electricity from crores of cooler and can be a revolutionary idea like the LED . it can easily be implemented by timer switch

Nahargarh fort is located in jaipur,and is atop the aravali mountain range which is one of the oldest mountain system of India.Legend has it that the king of Jaipur,built it in the name of a sage Nahar Singh who came in his dream,and told him to built it in his name otherwise he won't let it stay,as the fort had mysteriously come down on many occasions,so the raja agreed to the prophecy of his dream.The raja had nine queens.

I have visited so many places all are unique .I wish to mention Andamans islands. Very beautiful also have great inspiration for our freedom fighters.central jail is must visit.A never ending saga of our national heroes. I bow to them.so many islands like Havelock ,beautiful sea beaches. Radhanagar beach is must visit.
0 0 we are educated and we are the people who are making other countries but we can't create our own country because people who siting on top and people who are siting in ministy they don't have any vision and they dont go inside any other country and see the progress. its very easy to go other country adopt all the good practise and implement in our country but our minister are outdated and our constituion is useless
0 0 i think gov should create continuous improvement department in each ministry. this department will continuously survey people who are taking their service and try to implement 100 initiave every year. we know to understand we are 100 years behind than other countries in technology and improvements. we do not good infrastructure good public transport good advance technology, easy to do business. Every place we are far behind. we are same people who are working in dubai, usa, europe
0 0 we should create Metro in all part of the country. Metro is running on electricity and cars are running on petrol. if we do not provide good public transport people will use car. if you provide good public transport we are less dependent on petrol. After creating good public transport increase parking fees, tax on cars so people will not buy that much car and our coutnry will be less dependent on oil country

0 0 India is having the Great Himalayan Mountain Range and the magnificent view of those snow clad peaks is a beauty in itself. There are many people who  wants to find peace and be away from city life. The remote places of the Himalayas should be developed in the way that they maintain their traditional activities and also away from road heads, ie not making them "hill stations".They will definitely attract the trekkers and adventurers towards them. eg Mana Village nr Badrinath; Bakhim,Sikkim etc .
1 0 Hampi, Karnataka  is an incredibly beautiful place.This is a major tourist attraction among foreign tourists, but not very well visited by Indians.

As their is no provision to keep garbage, used plates, water bottle etc.. passengers used to throw id outside. It should be duty of canteen or the delivery boy to collect all garbage. Each coach should have atleast one dustbin so that passengers wont litter anymore.

0 0 swacha Bharat is a very good concept.For that matter it may be a house,street,village,hamlet,town, city or the offices of Govt or Private or any public gathering places .Initially propoganda and publicity was given.Most of the officials have given good poses while cleaning streets, public places. Much political colour was added initially.  Swatcha Bharat Tax also introduced. My request if every owner, officer or concerned takes care of cleaning, no need for advt or color.every one to do own duty
0 0 In June 2015 visited Pachmarhi, Madhya Pradesh again after Mar 1993. All the tourist places have become over crowded resulting in drastic collection of garbage - plastic bottles, wrappers, diapers, etc. Charges for visiting toursit places have been forced by Forest department and that too enormously and with that guide is forced upon in the name of employment. Forest department should get the garbage collected from these tourist places and restrict number of tourists per day.

There is no need to add incredible before India . OUR INDIA WAS ALWAYS INCREDIBLE, IS INCREDIBLE AND WILL INCREDIBLE.
the Basic thing is just to learn, How to keep our proud clean, safe and secure. I wish our villages could developed so good that they should be compared in town/city and that day dream that you have shown us will automatically become true.
ALWAYS WITH & FOR OUR INDIA
0 0 Sir, I am from Mumbai and i wish our forests should be conserved and protected. Like Bhutan has in its Constitution that 60% of its land shall be under forest cover, can we not have like wise amendment in our Constitution as well. This will also conserve our wildlife and varieties of plants/trees and forests will one day protect us too. We can also connect our forests that are spread in adjacent states through biological corridor so that our animals can roam freely around. Thanks
1 0 Good Evening Sir,

Sir Please Find the Attachment of Complete Report. Thank you
0 0 Sir as u told that those students who were not able to crack any of the govt. exam within their stipulated age than they will get the chance to some reputed pvt. co. Sir my suggestions is that without doing this why dont u pass a circular mentioning this that those candidates who were preparing for last 5 years and not yet crack any one of the govt job will get atleast group D post but he has to show his admit card of last 5 years which proves that he consistently tried for it. This is justice .

1 0 #MyGov : Dear Sir - You have proposed that the government would like to give LPG cylinders to poor families who used wood etc. as fuel, which is a very noble thought. Just a view point, is it possible that the GOI promotes community kitchens with LPG as fuel on a large scale thru gram panchayats as this would enhance optimization of LPG use. Instead of individual houses having LPG cylinders, small villages can have multiple community kitchens. This can be implemented as a pilot project first.

1 2 In Dubai government has given clear direction to his tourist ministry to bring 40 million tourist in a year. we don't see any target from India government to his ministry. we are paying taxes but our government is not competitive. private company are more competitive than our government. I think british are more better than our gov. specially old minister and politician never bring good fortune to our people

The trip to Kashmir was  the trip of a lifetime.
The lush green meadows before the climb,
The pristine beauty of Gulmarg, in the background
Transported by cable car on to the majestic heights
The spectacular breath taking, vastness of the mountains
Unsurpassed, indescribable and incredible !
Kashmir -- a place every Indian MUST visit… and be proud of.

2 0 India is great, indeed. We just celebrated Holi, the Festival of colours. Went to Chandni Chowk, Delhi, ahead of Holi and happened to be part of such a nice, colourful and playful culture parade. What a luck! Did not have my camera but could not resist myself so clicked some pictures with my mobile. Some for you to taste love, dance, bonhomie and celebrations that this festival of colours is known for.
0 0 Take the craze of Diwali in Delhi, Christmas in London, Summer Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, Valentine's day in Paris and then add it to the month long madness of Olympic Games or the World Cup and cram all that into a span of 5 days and you still wouldn't know what you are missing if you haven't been in Kolkata during Durga Puja!

0 0 Hi narendra modi ji,I have an idea to make incredible india.Actually in real i dont want anybody to be poor and malnutritioned in india.I have one idea which you as prime minister can implement it in india so that nobody in india will be poor.See india has huge amount of population size 132 crores as on 2016.I want each citizen of india should contibute 1 rupee on the daily basis excluding poor people.The amount which will be generated on the daily basis should distribute to poor people.
0 0 Dear Sir...
There are many important and unknown historic places in India. I wish to give a suggestion to Tourism Ministry.It will be really helpful if a guide containing info about all important and to be seen places from each state.This will help travellers to know them and visit them.Every state Tourism Board must bring out this guide with photos and route maps.This guide should be sold at a nominal price in all Railway Station, Airports and Bus Stand. This will help to promote Tourism.

1 0 The attached Pic I took from Vijay Durga, Maharashtra. In India, The Important thing is, Every Structure, Every Monument has a story or History to tell about. Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his works are similarly fascinating and worth learning. The one who understood the IMportance of having control over ocean. I dwell into the similar thought when I see this or the other pictures of forts build in between ocean and that two with no such advance resources like today's era.
0 0 Haridwar heaven on earth.. One must visit it for pristine beauty of nature,to achieve peace of mind,to get ultimate happiness.
0 0 IN GOD’S OWN COUNTRY
My heart aches for a draught of sweet drink
Fresh from the swaying green coconut palms
As dusk descends on the serene back-waters of Kerala
The anchored house-boat, rests idly on the calm waters
On the bow,  an earthen  pot  dances , in explicable ecstasy
In tune with the lapping of the water against the sides of the boat
Each sip of God’s Plenty  from God’s Own Country
Brings an incredible sense, of peace, to my weary mind.

0 0 Sir,I belongs to rajasthan and from last 5 yrs I am working at patna,bihar. I am always worried about water scarcity and as i am rajasthani i faced water scarcity problem from my childhood but here at bihar, people waste too much water it always make me sad and I saw many govt water supply system needs maintenance
I just want to suggest please make an application where we can post picture and request to repair & Maintenance of water supply system so concern dept take action as soon as possible
0 0 Save water
Many of us use RO water purifiers at our home to purify the drinking water, but do we know that around 75% of the water fed into RO water purifier is wasted, only 25% is extracted as drinking water. For 1 liter safe filtered drinking water in the RO tank, 3 liters goes rejected.
This causes a tremendous Overhead on the Water Supply as well as Sewage Treatment system of Apartment Complexes. Here is very simple solution for it, use it for toilet flushing, washing clothes, kitchen etc.

0 0 Respected Sir,
Incredible India can  become incredible only if tourism is promoted to its fullest. The example was JAL MAHOTSAV  conducted by MP Tourism- it was excellent and very well organised. The problem in India is there are more than enough spots, however, facilities there are highly suboptimal.
I have an idea- choose 10 cities , spent 100 crores for hotels, good and direct connectivity , sightseeing and lavish food. Campaign for a 15 day package tour especially for foreigners.
0 0 My visit to Varanasi... It was a great trip for me when I visited the oldest & historic city Varanasi. I enjoyed the boat ride on River Ganga. I visited Sri Kashi Vishwanatha temple and Bindhumadhav temple.I felt so blessed when I took bath in Ganga River.This was my memorable trip after undergoing both hip joint replacement surgeries. One has to enjoy Hot Ginger Tea (Garam Adhrak Chaai) sold in mud cups.Also Lassi during the summer season.I could see many foreigners enjoying their stay here.

0 0 Let us bring to notice the developments and the status of progress of the schemes started newly by the PM. Advertisements of the schemes which are starting newly is done on a great scale. But how far is it reaching the people is not let known.  Actually that is more important than a sheme starting.  People have to know how the ones who have taken up the schemes are benefitted.  This will encourage more people to utilize the benefits of the initiatives taken by the Gov't.

0 0 Sir, For our country to become prosperous it should  become well irrigated and for this we should have nadi -jod project along with water harvesting schemes. This project would help in storing flood waters and in creating network for shifting water to the desired places. This will help in improving quantum, spread & consistency of rainfall and in increasing forest covers and in thus creating cycle of good monsoons. If importing gas from Iran is feasible why is network of waterways difficult ?

0 0 Dear Modiji,
One suggestion for addressing the plastic garbage issue that affects all our urban metros and cities - can we make it mandatory for all municipal and local bodies to have plastic recycled material used for all road repair works? If we need to revolutionise the Smart City movement this adoption for all plastic reuse in roads should be tied with allocation of JNNURM funds from Ministry of Urban Develoment and also Roads and Surface Transport Ministry.

Only govt authorised hoardings or banners can be allowed. This will make city clearly visible.Ask not to use electric-traffic  polls,tree,any public place material,etc.to misuse.make provision to penalise such defaulters with law and gov.deptt officers.
