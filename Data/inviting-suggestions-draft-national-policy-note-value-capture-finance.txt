0 0 There has to be an audit on the incoming payments that India is supposed to receive by certain international treaties such as the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), for example. Consider the IWT,1960 as an example here- as per Annex H, when the World Bank used to administer the treaty-X percent of A (working expenses)+B(Fixed expenses of 110,000 pounds) was supposed to be paid upto 1963. Later India and Pak were supposed to arrive at a formula for payment to be made by Pak. Pls ref attachment

5 0 General compartments in express train.
It is a main problem that, many express trains have only two general compartments.The people who have no reservations are deprived of their train journey due to heavy rush in express trains.
Hence request to consider to increase general compartments in express trains to avoid heavy rush and acciedents.
1 0 City Development should be well planned with infrastructures targeted for the population growth for minimum next twenty years. Majority of Indian population is not able to afford the high cost of real estate developments. One solution is to promote high rise buildings, wide roads, corridors (space) for future infrastructures, etc.
0 0 allow black money to come back in the country as tax free and without any punishment(for a limited period) if they invest the money in key and required infrastructure sector. in return investor will remain the owner and the profits will belongs to him. this will be motivation factor  and helps in bringing black mpney in the country.
0 0 When we common man talk of infrastructure we focus on interior roads with poth holes and are accident prone. Kindly implement an accountable municipal system all through the nation that is robust to control these issues, may be dividing few kms under a accountable micro municipal group makes it easier to handle, repair and maintain. Which is absent in the current system. A counter supervisory central municipal system to audit and to prevent corruption would benefit all.

If you can provide an opportunity for them they give best results.

0 0 when I say integrated development plan means it should cover measured area around any particular govt.'s new infra project wherein a special dp must be applicable and not the already existing one.
0 0 Hello,
As per my idea, when Govt. plans an infra project, say for example a bridge, it should not consider just building up a bridge, but an integrated development plan should designed such that if any private party trying take undue benefit or advantage of such projects should come under local &/or central govt. regulations wherein government is benefited as well the private party under controlled price. This will put chains on rich private investors and help genuine investments.

Draft National Policy Note on Value Capture Finance
The Government policy hitherto has been to make heavy investments in the vital sectors of the economy where private players were either barred or their entry prohibitively costly. The failure of the successive Government to monetize the gains from investments and reap benefits from Value Capture Finance has been basically on account of peculiar Public Sector Culture and near absence of accountability, except to s

0 0 An Infrastructure Deposit scheme should be launched through Banks as similar to saving account .A depositor should be given higher rate of interest a comparison to saving account. And deposits under this account must have a lock in period and Tax exemption may be given on such deposits.An appreciation certificate may also be imparted to the depositors recognizing their contribution for the nation development. With an  unified rate for the compensation for the land acquisition may be given.
0 0 R&D and production capabilities of defence establishments such as HAL, DRDO, ISRO, NHAI, BRO, shipyards should be expanded and multiplied on war footing despite financial barriers.

Let us gear up our nation to thwart future national security challenges which are foreseen by experts. Defence friendy thrust is a must.

Please save them before too late. Save it.

Our country has a glorious heritage.This is being damaged beyond repair bcoz of our negligence and apathy. ASI is hardly contributing to lessen the damage.

Today TN & kar are fighting for water but in feature inter state should also face such problem. So to overcome this problem the River union should be completed at war level, stop all mega project except defence to cover River project.

0 0 Apart from just monetary value to be shared, there should be a mechanism in place to make such private owners / industries responsible for the cleanliness of the area. This way a non-monetary benefit is passed on to the Government in the form of achieving the goals of Swacch Bharat campaign.
Examples can be investments in equipment/motor vans which can clean the roads, placing of bins at short distances, recycling of waste.
0 0 New plots and land given to private colonies on basis of terms and conditions firstly pass an act in Parliament regarding to new properties sold on basis of terms &condition if in future land is to be needed by govt. Relating for ambitious projects it can be taken by govt easily and govt. have agree to pay 3times more than market value or provide land in other place or market.

2 0 The Governments are incurring huge expenditure at infrastructure without addressing the primary issues of why the need has arisen. The cities are bulging, requiring better infrastructure and thus attracting more people which nullify all efforts. The case study can be for Delhi where we have all Ministries and Headquarter. Can't Ministry of Textile, Shipping, Commerce & Industry or Education etc be established at say Surat, Chennai, Mumbai and Chandigarh respectively. This would de-congest Delhi.
1 0 RAILWAY HAS AMPLE PROPERTY BUT USELESS SO IN MY OPINION BIG SHOPPING MALL,SCHOOLS,HOSPITALS & OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICES MAY BE CAN MAKE USE OF THOSE UNUSED LAND ON LEASE.
0 0 Providing Water to districts like Latur by train was a great achievement. it is indeed difficult to address problems of Water starvation in remote parts of India. Only physical transfer of Water is possible for states like Telangana. Trains can serve as efficient mechanism for Indian states starving of Water. States with excess Water need to conserve and store Water. This Water can be moved to regions affected by water starvation.
0 0 Instead of talking about poverty line now talk about lifting families above prosperity line which may be defined say as the minimum wage GOI declares;Institutions like NABARD should be mandated to focus and lift people above prosperity line and not poverty line which is ridiculous at $1/day
0 0 Most important value capture keeping future in mind is of saving rivers and river water and river sands.This has to be done making task forces of states which share river .All dams,ponds, iondustrial activity, pollution must be controlled by states evolving a joint law including tax on food stuff;also interlinking rivers can be poart of the same task force;please note several rivers have died and these need to revived and IITs and IIIT need to study all rivers for sustaining them
0 0 One suggestion for VCF.  India should have a new Capital. In 1920, when Capital was shifted to Delhi, it was thought to be the centre of India.  Now in view of the security threat from North Western front and the current confusions in governance issues in Delhi, I feel Government of India should think in terms of new capital somewhere bordering UP, MP and Bihar (on the lines of Washington DC of USA).  Many smart cities are being created, why not one of them becomes the New Capital of India.
0 0 If government is serious on getting the maximum output and finish projects in time the only way that the projects should have fund allocated before start of project. The vendor or contractor is paid on time bound basis of bills of contractor and marking the lowest a contractor can go. The next step should be in case of dispute which is normally payment related to be resolved time bound (one month). Tender conditions cannot be one sided or again st the law. you can projects before time.
0 0 To arrange finance for infrastructure and development is possible under PPP mode and BOT model as happening in case of constructions of highways. Govt. may always increase the stamp duty of surrounding land to get the benefits of such new infrastructures and development. A new development cess may also be introduced which may go directly in the kitty of Central Government. However there is also a need to fix the period upto which the private party maintain such project to recover their cost.
0 0 There should be more accountability for public sector contractors engaged in roads, parks and public infrastructure. Severe punishment should be incorporated in terms of hefty fines for poor quality of work and blacklisting for repeated instances, in the proposed policy on value capture finance.
For example, a municipal park in our locality is renovated multiple times in the span of last 11 years, with public spend of more than 10 crore rupees. The same is still not fit for use.
0 0 Ref: Tensions between States (like Karnataka and TN) on sharing river waters. Right time now to call a meeting of all States, tell them Centre will fund enhancing value delivered by rivers by 50% thru better sharing, yet better utilization of water. A Commission may be set up to identify the current water availability & utilization of water, link rivers, use modern methods like drip irrigation to utilize water better, to give 50% more value. Let Centre bear the costs from its River Linking Fund.

If govt collect only Rs 1/- for Each Citizen each day it will amounting to Rs 125 Crore in a day and Rs 45,625/- Crore in a year, so such huge fund will will help in reduction of foreign debt.
1) Sir for Collection Debit Rs 1/- from each Bank Account
2) collect Rs 365/- as direct tax mandatory and amount is small for individual but big for govt
3) Introduce flat Rs 1/-as welfare cess
4) Open one account of govt in which such amount can be deposited.
Sir Plz think on it.
0 0 Now the time came, we should bring the #MPs and #MLAs salary under taxable amount. They are already getting all the basic facility free of cost, then, why their salary is not coming under taxable amount. Every citizen of India is paying tax except #politicians. Pleas bring them as well under tax umbrella.

1. Govt should be selective in applying VCF charges only to actual beneficiaries from infrastructure projects.
2. VCF charges can be recovered in form of infrastrucutre cess, additional cess can be charged on product, service sales transaction.
3. Additional cess can be charged on top of stamp duty to recover VCF charges.
4. Govt should be careful on not to over burden citizens with levies & taxes.Govt is already taxing citizens to make funds for executing projects.

1 0 If government looks to charge for water and commission desalination plants along the coast lines, may be we can reduce over dependence on seasonal rains and have a source of water that will not exhaust. City dwellers can be asked to pay for the water consumed. Will also help conservation efforts. Saudi Arabia has a water pipeline with desalinated water going from Jeddah to Riyadh.
1 0 Developed cities like Mumbai are currently in overdevelopment and there is just no space to increase infrastructure. There should be more tax breaks for people willing to move to less developed areas to reduce infrastructure pressure. Also, overdevelopment takes a severe toll on health and well-being. In Gurgaon, it is now almost now over-developed. DLF Phase 1 to DLF Phase 4 used to be 10 minutes drive in 2004 and now it is much much longer. Peace of mind cities are essential.
0 0 After land is procured by a builder or a developer, it should be developed with defined number of years. Failures to do that result in lower values for future parcels that may be sold. Also, infrastructure for nascent development is a high cost, which needs to be split and premiumised for others who may wish to continue development. Also, as part of infrastructure efforts, it is time to meter water consumption and bill consumers accordingly. It will help conserve and also sustain good projects.
0 0 Dear Sir, With respect to the Land and Property developers and owners. I think the main problem is not how to provide them land, freedom from bureaucracy, provide ease of license, ease of labor, ease of  operations. The main concern is how to pass on these benefits of government efforts to the common, middle-class, fixed wage earners (leave alone to the poor or the ones who are BPL).I think the criteria to run-approve their projects must include the rules and terms they use to deal with EndUser.

0 0 In respect to improvements in custom process, I want to suggest that, all the procedure of billing should be made online, there should be common system of  billing, which can easily be cross verify by online process, It will be more transparent & fair, the chances of fraud can be minimised, further, it can be verified from initial stage of borading of goods to unloading and release of goods from port or godown, while physical movement should be made under CCTV camara  etc., best wishes

Those who are interested to sponsor the roads and other infrastructural activities, poverty alleviation schemes, other economic activities etc.  required for development  may be encouraged. Contracts should be awarded to right/clean person in case of roads and other fields so as prolong the life of roads & other things.

0 0 Just like the "GIVE IT UP" option for LPG subsidy, why doesn't the government start a "GIVE IT UP" scheme for RESERVATION of the reserved categories who are economically able and do not require reservation any more! The seats/posts vacated in such a manner may be provided to economically weaker people of the society who need them.
0 0 In continuation of my previous massage My suggestion is to realease retention money or security deposit of contractor after completion of defects liability period by RNB on approval of the organisation using the facility or infrastructure. This will surely improve the quality of work and less maintenance problem of infrastructure!!
0 0 I have seen the PWD and R&B departments don't force the contractors to repairs the defects during defects liability period of construction work. The complaints regarding repairs and maintenance are made numerous times to these departments but they seem least bother about it. The amount of retention money or security deposit is released to the contractor by PWD or RNB without approval of the user who are actually using the building or organis.
0 0 In respect to improvements in custom processes, I want to suggest that, the procedure should be simple and maximum use of advance technology in paper work as well as movement in physical goods. Loading and unloading of goods from vessel should be speedy and accurate without damages of goods, CCTV camara should be installed at all the area of port and also in offices.further, Godown or storage of goods should be updated with advance technology to move the goods with comfort and safety,best wishes
0 0 Sir, I suggest that government should have a commercial flying licence scheme for budding pilots to start there own small airlines with even a two seater aircraft. Commercial licences should be cheap with a cost not more than 1 lakh. Govt should allow small private airport's with a one time licences fees to accomodate small single engine aircrafts. This will revottionalise flying,building indigenous aircrafts, connect India, boost tourism and improve employment.
0 0 It is true that there is going to be substantial value enhancement whenever government spends money and the roads and infrastructure there gets even doubled or tripled because of that. However, it may be difficult for govt to redeem as they simply say "Did I ask for this?", "Where is the appreciation realized by me?" etc. There is a very easy solution for this. Government can INCREASE the property value and on sale, the STAMP DUTY solvages revenue for govt and share by State and Center.

1. Earn from advertisements. Most of the govt properties roads or other public places are fully packed with lots of adds which also gives unhygenic view. 1/1

0 0 There are basic flaws in our system such as
1. Land is considered as asset.
2. Money is the only criteria of judging person.
3. We created a society where ethics, morals, values etc. Have become cowards words!!
In Gujarati, there is saying Jar (money), Jamin (land), and joru (unchaste) are root cause of all fights.
If you look at our current system, we are exactly moving towards disaster.
With this background, the solution lies in the same.

4. Set cyber audit system.

0 0 Sir,the basic issue is leakage of govt investment. On average 30 to 80 percent of govt expenditures get converted to black money or losses every year and this is the reason why we are still a developing county. Its is well known fact that current govt procurement system or tender system is the major source of revenue leakage. Now the time has come when we have to re set the smart mechanism, my suggestion is to set national accounting protocol for such player involved in this. 1/1

1 0 In respect policy about value capture finance, I want to suggest that, there are require some changes in accounting method in government concern, Though govt. is not profit oriented concern, but, the real position of sources and application of funds and the investment made in project, the value of assets and liabilites etc. should be maintained and prepared, it should be very much useful for speedy growth, by analysing the real position of financial statements of such assets & liabilities,thanks
0 0 Two quick things that will boost the national interests.
1. Farmers need to adopt community farming or corporate farming. Farmers can lend their land to corporates for farming under regulation from government or teach to their local community as one learn from a new things. Make a place for that farmer to reach out in each village and details will be jotted down on paper. If it is found helpful it will be distributed to each farmer in that locale.
2. Start Railway Engineering in IIT's.

0 0 Respected Prime Minister,
I hope one day you will definitely come out with this idea with various modifications and announce it in your Mann Ki Baat Programme in Radio.
Thank you once again, Sir for giving me this opportunity to speak out my views on this big social problem which is ruining the life of common man who lives in villages far from urban areas where medical facilities do not reach.
With deep respects and full of hopes from you, Sir.
0 0 Respected Prime Minister,
We have to plan for the future.  Start a new course like 3 years duration in medical field. The Science students with B.Sc and M.Sc should be trained in this field with basic knowledge in medical using latest technology along with practical training and they should be posted in the rural areas where the qualified doctors refuse to work.  This is the only way we can solve the problem and we don't have any other option left, if at all we are interested in this area.
0 0 Respected Prime Minister,
After so many years of freedom, I find very little change in common man especially the poor farmer.  He is not cared at hospitals, he is not given ambulance, he has to carry the dead body on his shoulders, the poor man cannot afford the medical facilities  and the list goes on.  We rarely find medical facilities at rural areas, they have to travel all the way to the district headquarters for the medical help, we have very few doctors in India compared to population.

2 0 Dear Modiji,
I have a suggestion for Solar Power generation. Instead of acquiring lot of farm land for Solar Power plants Government can use Kilometers of National Highway like rooftop model. for every 100 or 200kms Government can install sheds like setup and install roof panels like you have implemented on River Canals. Similar concept Govt Can adopt and save lot of form land. That will protect roads from extreme heat increasing the life of roads and fulfill the power requirements. Raghavendra

0 0 The NPS scheme being run by the government can become more efficient and the volumes may increase tremendously if the return on annuity (which presently is meagre 4-5%) after maturity is linked with government bonds and the interest income is made tax free. There should be a rider of only one annuity linked with one PRAN and only NPS corpus to be invested in order to check misuse. This will ensure sustained funding to the government and social security to the retirees.

In a way, any infrastructure development result in land value going-up and this result in benefit to state governments by way of increased collection on account of stamp duty. it is the duty of state government to give account to central government for increased revenue due to infra projects. This abnormal increased revenue of state govt should go into infra fund for more development, for first five years.

0 0 Respected Modiji,
I have noticed that when ever a new road is laid in the city they don't remove and reuse  the older layer of the road but just dump new tar mix to build the road. The problem due to this is that over a period of time the level of the road rises above the house/building level thereby flooding the houses/buildings during rainy season. While at US I had seen they have a machine which removes around 2 to 3 inches of layer from the road and the new tar and gravel is filled in.
0 0 One point which occurred to me is that some of the VCF tools, I gather, lends to add to the state's treasury and it wasn't very clear to me how this additional revenue (which is through the value added from the infrastructure projects) is adequately passed through to the relevant departments and how this pass-through is guaranteed in the legislation/policy. I suppose, making this pass through very clear and transparent, and binding if necessary, can help with continued reinvestment elsewhere.
0 0 The policy note I felt was well written and the value capture tools outlined in the annex seem to be quite good, and to be completely honest, I wasn't able to conceive of anything more to add to the list presented.
0 0 Govt.of Îndia has to make right to gain ownership right to back to govt.. In case of selling property to people pass bill for new properties of govt with term they had full right to get back for infrastructure project.

In various centre funding projects either fully or partially has to inspect more and more times by various officials changes their location duties to inspect project work and material.

0 0 Sir, aap Swaksha Bharat Aviyan ke liye bahut paisa laga diye par isme jitna sudhar hona chahiye utna nahi hua, mera ek idea hai ki kyu na government dust/kachara karidane ka kam kare (2-5 Rs per kg), isse log apna kachra lalach me sambhal kar rakhenge bechane ke liye aur koi usse sadko tatha idhar-udhar phekega bhi nahi.

0 0 A uniform charges for change in land use should not be levied as I earlier wrote that at same locality there can be two landlord one who want to stand on his own feet and other one want to make profit by changing land use.
0 0 Govt. should also help to public to get benefited by approving cheep lone to groups of unemployed youths of the gram panchayats through the highway/railway/corridor is passing.Therefore the land use charges has to be less for underprivileged society along such highway which has a opportunity to start their own business.For this purpose govt. has to decide case to case basis that the land owner if want to change agricultural land to other use than what is the purpose of the deal,amount of deal

The area will develop land rates will go up and when new constitution takes place more revenue will come to govt. The area selected should be in a planned manor such that it's beneficial to many parties and overall improvement in the area.
