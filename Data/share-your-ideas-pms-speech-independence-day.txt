3 0 LEAVE THE OROP FOR OFFICERS - LET US READ THIS INTERESTING ESSAY ON LEADERSHIP BELOW OFFICER LEVEL
Leadership Below Officer Level in the Indian Armed Forces*
By Captain Balamurugan R Subbu**
?Leadership is a complex phenomenon, leaders are both born and made, but mostly made.?
General George S. Patton Jr.1
Introduction
The above quote reveals complexity of the leadership phenomenon. It is a phenomenon which comprises various personality traits like bearing, courage, decisiveness, endurance and initiative etc. Modern psychology claims that different personality traits are responsible for various types of leadership. These traits cannot be analysed in isolation. Blending them leads to an overall leadership style. A widely accepted definition of leadership describes it as ?an act of conducting, guiding and persuading?. It has been recognised that for one man to obey another with some enthusiasm, there ought to be something in common. Any individual from a group can become a leader subject to a chance given to him. It is a proven fact that these traits always form part of the overall personality of an individual. These inherent traits in a person can always be improved upon and brought out by regular training.
2 Till recently, in the Indian Armed Forces it was a moot point that we do not have able leadership below officer level. During the period from 2000 to 2010, when induction into the officer cadre was short by 20 per cent, this weak link in our junior military leadership was identified clearly. Today,when the Armed Forces are facing shortage of young officers, do we have sufficient leaders below officer level? With the severe shortage of young officers ? in units/ sub units, can we continue to employ young officers to perform all minor tasks? Why can we not employ Non Commissioned Officers (NCOs) and Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs) instead, to perform these routine tasks confidently? To find an answer to this question, we need to carry out a systemic introspection. The quality of leadership below officer level is very crucial for the Armed Forces. The burden of work on young officers can be reduced by employing JCOs / NCOs for routine duties? which would relieve them for employment in more complex tasks.
This essay explores the answers to the above questions.
Role of Senior NCOs and JCOs.?
The British Indian Army was led by British officers to uphold loyalty to the British Crown. But, the personnel below officer rank (PBOR), the natives of India, were separated from the British officers by language, socioeconomic status, local customs and life style. To bridge this gap the British Army felt the need of having junior leaders of similar background as the natives. They were entrusted with some additional authority to command and control a group of soldiers during operations and peace time. In 1929-30, they were given the status of ?below
officer rank?, but above the natives. The authority and powers of these junior leaders were not laid down in any manuals / documents. British officers in command (in field) were privileged to employ these junior leaders according to the situation.
After 1947, the Indian Army retained the same colonial concept. It is true that the existing system is time proven and won laurels in the past operations. But, the system has failed to adjust with the changing environment. What are the factors that have led to this situation? Do our JCOs and NCOs have the ability to take decisions in dire situations? Do we impart adequate training to them to carry additional responsibilities, distinctly apart from the tasks given to them in the colonial days? Do we impart training during induction period to enhance their utility commensurate with their ability and potential? The answers to these questions would mostly be ?No?. Apart from these factors the system has some inherent weaknesses. Weaknesses. Inherited perception and thinking led to notable neglect in upgrading the standard of leadership training of PBOR. This
weakness needed more attention, especially after Kargil War. Following weaknesses have inhibited the growth of leadership qualities in PBOR :
(a) Age factor of JCOs.
(b) Levels of education and intelligence.
(c) Limited exposure to various situations in initial years of training and service.
(d) Aiming for personal benefits from higher authorities.
(e) Introducing regionalism, nepotism and favouritism.
(f) ?Chalta hai? and ?Sahab se pucho? attitude i.e. avoiding excellence and responsibility.
(g) Fear of being looked down upon among colleagues and losing face.
Organisational factors which have contributed to these weaknesses are discussed in the succeeding paragraphs.
A. Intake Standard.?
Since Independence enrolment of the Other Ranks (OR) in the Armed Forces are based on recruitment rallies and drives. No test to evaluate the qualities of character and leadership of a recruit is conducted. Later, on becoming a NCO / JCO, the organisation expects him to display leadership qualities to meet varying situations? whereas, throughout his career these aspects are ignored. Then it becomes a herculean task to train the individual to imbibe the required qualities to reach the expected standard.
B. Leadership Training in Service. This is an important facet of military training. Leadership training should start abinitio from the recruit training stage
and it should continue to be upgraded at various stages in an OR?s career. Unfortunately, this aspect has been given very little attention and
importance.
C. Reluctance in Taking Decisions.?
To keep their own tail clear, the PBOR always follow the principle of getting back to the immediate senior, whenever in doubt. They are unwilling to take minor decisions? and whenever they do, later they do not accept responsibility for the same. This aspect got highlighted very clearly while examining the incident, when in 2008, a JCO failed to save his ambulance from a mob in Jammu & Kashmir. Personal Factors. As per Freud?s Theory in Psychology, every individual has some personality traits which control his behaviour in day to day life. If an individual?s character and integrity are questioned, as a matter of rule, then he cannot become a successful leader among his subordinates. The recent developments in society have produced varying effects on the character of an individual. These trends have not spared the Armed Forces as well. The
Armed Forces have not modified the system to check and balance the effects of these social trends, and the responsibility to keep his image and integrity untarnished, is left to the individual.
D. Centralisation of Responsibility.?
As no mistakes are accepted by the higher echelons, various authorities at the middle level do not take any chances. Even for petty jobs an officer is detailed? although the same could be easily done by a NCO / JCO. It leads to lowering of morale of both the officers and the men. A leader below officer level is not even allowed functional independence to carry out his task. To reach the stage of combat decisionmaking in war? a section/platoon commander (which essentially implies a NCO/JCO) has to learn to take decisions during peace time soldiering. Due to dilution of authority and overcentralisation of responsibility, JCOs / NCOs get into the habit of looking over their shoulders all the time.
E. Curbing Initiative.?
Initiative is the essence of a leader?s character. This quality, amongst other important factors, helps him to come out with innovative ideas. There is a growing tendency in the officer cadre to curb the initiative of NCOs / JCOs. The NCOs and JCOs need to be groomed in a planned and progressive manner by decentralisation of responsibility. Rigid Frame of Mind. It is said that to get an old idea out is more difficult than to introduce a new idea. The present higher echelon officers (because during their younger days the strength of officers was sufficient) believe that no OR can be a good leader. Some of them believe that only officers should be employed to accomplish all tasks. This thinking has led to neglect of the idea of imparting leadership training to NCOs and JCOs.
Remedial Measures Reorientation of Leadership Training. Today, employment of Armed Forces is not limited to conventional war situations only. Their commitment in internal peacekeeping, counterinsurgency and low intensity conflicts etc. has grown over a period of time. Due to shortage of young officers and unsatisfactory state of leadership standard amongst NCOs and JCOs, it would be difficult for the Armed Force to perform their enhanced tasks/role with
required efficiency. Since officers would not be available to take decisions everywhere, NCOs and JCOs have to be trained to take vital decisions at
lower levels of leadership. To meet this requirement leadership training for junior leaders below officer level needs modification and reorientation by initiating following measures:?
(a) Recruitment Procedure. Evaluation of a large number of recruits for assessing leadership qualities is a difficult task. The present recruitment procedure should include a simple psychological test to identify key leadership traits. Result of this test, in the Record of Service, would later help in selection of right individuals for nurturing leadership qualities during their service career.
(b) Induction Level Training. Result of psychological test should be used as a base during initial training at the basic training establishments. Firstly, a discreet check on character and leadership traits should be maintained during this phase of their training. Thereafter, the parent units should take on the responsibility of guiding individual soldiers to attain their full leadership potential.
(c) NCO Level Training. During the initial stage of training in the units, periodical review of leadership traits should be conducted. These reviews should highlight the positive and negative character traits clearly. At the end of about 10 years service, a formal training capsule on leadership training should be conducted to select NCOs for training at regimental centres. They should also be tested at various levels of responsibility like detachment, section and platoon. These evaluations could help in ascertaining the level of responsibility that can be given to individuals. Suitable candidates should be subjected to section / platoon level tactical exercises. Successful NCOs should be screened to assess their eligibility for promotion to the JCO rank.
(d) JCO Level Training.?
When a NCO becomes a JCO, he generally experiences a period of stagnancy in his career. At this stage, he is neither part of a working party nor is he a working party commander. Therefore, in day to day functioning he needs to be given more responsibility, as this will give him confidence to shoulder bigger responsibilities, both, in peace time duties and as a leader during operations. On becoming a JCO, he needs training capsules on leadership so that he keeps abreast with the newly commissioned officers. Officers with adequate maturity and experience should guide the JCOs to become better leaders.
Role of Senior NCO / JCO
?No man is a leader until his appointment is ratified in the minds and hearts of his men?.
? DAG Hammarksjold
The responsibilities of a NCO and JCO should be defined in doctrines / pamphlets of the Armed Forces.?
These should be followed in letter and spirit at unit / sub unit level. The employability of a NCO/JCO, to take on the duties / responsibilities of a young officer, should be increased. This would encourage him to take decisions more confidently. Any person who fails to meet these responsibilities should be identified, and counselled to show improvement in a given time frame, failing which he should be wasted out to maintain functional efficiency of the organisation.
Knowledge and Exposure.?
In modern society, anyone who selects Armed Forces as a career is well informed and educated. As he moves ahead in service and gets promoted as a NCO / JCO, he tends to ignore the importance of knowledge to develop his leadership qualities. Competence comes with knowledge because experience alone does not make a man to grow to his full potential. A NCO / JCO should be given adequate opportunities to improve knowledge relevant to his service and trade. He should be encouraged to keep abreast with the younger generation by being open to new ideas. This would enhance his ability and confidence to work with subordinates. Even as a young jawan he should be exposed to take right decisions in complex situations, as part of a detachment to carry out important tasks. This methodology will pave the way for developing his leadership qualities.
Appraisal System.?
The appraisal system for NCO / JCO in vogue needs revision to meet future requirements. New features should be included to evaluate his character, professional acumen, level of initiative, willingness to take responsibility and other desired ibutes. The officer cadre should ensure that the new appraisal system is fair and judicious.
Role of Young Officers.?
When a young officer joins the unit from the academy his interaction with men starts through NCOs and JCOs. They help him to understand the men who will follow his command in peace and war. He should establish a positive rapport with them and take care not to hurt their emotions through immature conduct on his part. Young officers should understand that the NCOs and JCOs have spent most part of their lives in the Armed Forces and are a reservoir of inherited military wisdom. He should, therefore, endeavour to help them to become good leaders by entrusting them with more responsibility. Officers critical appraisal should be directed to reinforce the confidence of a NCO / JCO. Middle level leadership in the Armed Forces should give adequate freedom to NCOs/ JCOs to perform their duties confidently.
Comparison with Other Armies
In modern armies the concept of having competent NCOs has survived? but the concept of JCO has met with moderate success. The systems being followed in some foreign armies are enumerated below :
(a) The US Armed Forces.?
Comparing the United States (US) Army with Indian Armed Forces would be an inaccurate hypothesis. 1. In the US Army the role of NCOs in combat is vital. As a young NCO, he is given responsibility equal to, if not more, than our JCOs. 2. The NCO would be assessed for this on various occasions (to reach this level in his unit /sub unit). 3. His position is quite well defined in the organisation, alongwith his role, responsibilities and duties.4. The JCO like appointments in the US Armed forces are more at the formation and administrative level. The percentage of such appointments are very low in comparison to the Indian Armed Forces.
(b) Armed Forces of NATO Nations. Being a forerunner to the Indian Armed Forces, most of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) nations are still following the concept of JCO rank. Functioning and grooming aspects of their leaders below officer levels are very concisely explained in their tactical / operational doctrines. Studying these concepts indicate where we have failed in our Armed Forces.
(c) Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). SAF may be smaller in size? but, there are some aspects which we need to learn from them for betterment of our Armed Forces. In SAF the concept of JCO is given very less weightage. Induction of NCOs in SAF starts with a ?Reasoning and Psychological Test? at the age of 17 to 19 years. After selection they attend three years Graduation Programme in Defence Institutes. These NCOs, being backbone of SAF, become ?Specialists? or ?Subject Matter Experts? (SME) on completion of studies. These SMEs are young in age with high potential and are able to carry out all kind of tasks during operations and peace time. After 10 years of physical service SMEs are promoted to the rank of Warrant Officers (WOs) who are equivalent to our JCOs. On becoming WOs, they are mostly employed in administrative duties? unlike the Indian Armed Forces where a JCO is expected to lead a platoon in battle. This system in SAF ensures that an NCO is competent, intelligent and young to lead a platoon during operations.
Recommendations
The modern warfare is characterised by small detachment actions in specific tactical situations. In the prevalent system in the Indian Armed Forces, where the average age of JCOs is 3840 yrs, they would not be able to cope with the physical requirements of modern warfare. To that extent, existing system needs to be amalgamated with a new system. The salient features of the proposed new cadre are as under :
(a) Age Profile. Age profile of NCO/ JCO needs to be reduced to meet the basic requirements of modern warfare. With the reduction in age profile an NCO /JCO will be high in receptivity and more confident in taking additional responsibility to lead a detachment in peace and war.
(b) Formation of a New Cadre. Apart from the present JCO / NCO cadre, an additional stream of direct JCO / NCO cadre needs to be formed.
(c) Basic structure of the New Cadre would be as follows:
Features of the Proposed New Cadre.
(i) Educational qualification for the New Cadre would be 10 + 2 with preferably Diploma in Arts / Commerce / Technical field (specialisation).
(ii) Psychological test to be conducted during recruitment.?
(iii) Grooming and on the job training be given for six months at unit / sub unit level.
(iv) Younger age profile increases the employability in various conditions for an NCO. He is more flexible and receptive during initial military training.
(v) On completion of 10 years of physical service NCOs should be given an option to either go out of service or to get promoted to JCO rank (through selection).
(vi) Younger JCOs (30 to 32 yrs) would be more capable than the existing JCOs. As a JCO with a younger age profile, the individual would be available to the organisation for more than 10 years.
(vii) The present ratio of JCOs in the Indian Armed Forces may be reduced. Their employability should be more in administrative than operational roles in the units.
(viii) After 15 years of physical service as a JCO, he may be sent on retirement at the age of 4245 years or seconded to Para Military or Central Police Forces.
Conclusion
The NCOs and JCOs in future need to be broadminded: having depth in character, being tough, competent, better in man management, well informed
and balanced in thinking. These qualities would help them to provide better leadership at the lower levels in modern warfare conditions. The need today
is to identify the weaknesses, short falls and problem areas in leadership training of our PBOR. My intention in this essay is neither to project a bleak
picture nor to raise an alarm about the lack of leadership qualities of NCOs and JCOs. The need of the hour is to have professional soldiers? who are
competent, willing to take on responsibility and do not have ?followers? attitude of ?sahab se pucho?. There is a definite need for reforming the system?
else it may lead to failures during the hours of crises and need. This weak link has the possibility of remaining unnoticed during peace time but would
get highlighted during operations. Such changes are not possible in a short time frame of one or two years. A clear plan and road map should be
prepared so that we have combat ready Armed Forces, befitting our aspirations to be a great power.

1 0 there is no stress on corruption and accountability of official to delivery their duty on time

0 1 I fully agree with the PM, steps taken by govt against corruption. But there is a great need to stop corruption where govt personal are in direct contact with people. All over India one unique helpline number (like 100 for police) should be given where people can give complaint. From helpline complaint should be transferred to concerned anti corruption branch. Today corrupt people have no fear and people don't know where to complain.

15 2 sir can u bring about a rule of not circulating indian flags made of paper and not to sell them on occasions of independence day and republic day. because next day these flags are seen lying on the roads and in dustbins.I think we should teach the citizens to respect our national flag.

0 1 sir plzz include this
this is in nation's interest

0 2 PM Sir, you must take this great issue to the world forum- which is the crying need of our times. Being Indian, in nutshell, we can summarise it like this:
CCCIIIWWOHHHHAAMM... Comprehensive, Combined, Cozmozen's, Inclusive, Integrated, IndiaWorld, Wholistic, Holistic, Hygiene, Harmony, Happiness and Allied Missionary, Movement.

10 0 Sir,

And please speak on Gender Equality again sir.

18 0 Before 20 years, every school invites respected person of their village to addressed children on morality, value education. These persons become role model for every student and they learnt that money is not praised, knowldge is praised in society. But these tradition is gone and now rich man are become role model of every child.

6 2 How can we trained farmers with latest technology and infomation ? Can we teach them by agri students in every sunday in their village ? By doing this, Agri student will have more social responsibile and better understanding of farmers problems.

5 0 Understanding of Child pschycology & nutrition is very essential to every mother. Can we teach them with the help of experts ? College students, health educator can teach them in every sunday in their village schools. Govt should start a mission as ' Sunday School ' for farmers & mothers.

6 1 Our educated youths should take initiatives to establish science club in every village. It will be true tributes to our missile man APJ Abdul Kalam. If every village have a mandir, masjid, gurudwara or church then why not a science club . Science is the true religion.

7 0 Please addressed our youth to play minimum one hour everyday. We are proud that we have largest youths but maximum youth dislike physical labour, which cause tremoundsly increasing dieabetis, heart attact in the country.

2 0 A soldier join Army very young age (17-23 years) for Nation, but they retire at very crucial age (37-52 years)(as per rank) when they need. They have jobless at that stage when they need more money for fulfill their family requirement.

Respected "Pradhan Sewak Mahoday",
Shree Narendra Modi ji
As you wished in your popular Radio Programm, "Man Ki Baat" that people should send you Ideas, Opinion, Thoughts, choosing & selecting as subjects of PM's Red Fort Independence Day Speech... "I am the Creator, I m the Universe".' "The Universe is within Me"
                Not only this, today we are in search of LIFE & Aliens, apart from hoping to make settlements on other favourable & inhabitable planet in our solar system & outer space in the universe.?

Solar Home. Yes we can do that. We have unlimited solar energy in India. This would be the best we can implement and it will be impacted a lot.
Government Roles:
1. Subsidy (If possible)
2. Reduce import duty from solar energy equipments
3. Most Important: Research
We can call IITs or other technical institutes to come forward to give inputs of research in the solar energy sector. The prices and government appreciations would be the great announcements to be hear for them.

Indiscipline and corruption are hindrance for the development of our Great Nation and both are interrelated. We believe you will overcome it
My suggestions:
1.Compulsory Military Training of 2 years for gents after 12th std:, analyzed best suited to be absorbed in Defense Services to fill the shortage.
2. Engg: Education to be practical oriented (even by increasing duration) rather than present system of classroom based; hence Make in India will be fulfilled.

1 0 Sir, at lower levels of administration it is very difficult to get the work done from SC/ST employees. Either they do not know how to properly do a task or if they do know, they demand for bribes from public and because of the stringent provisions of Prevention of Atrocities Act, they threaten to falsely implicate their superiors, if their superiors ask them to perform their duties.

1 0 Sir, It may be your political or constitutional compulsion to speak in favour of RESERVATION or not to speak against RESERVATION, but it is true that the reservation system in present form has caused immense damage to the MERITS, TALENT, and moreover to the very fabric of society. Our country is lagging behind because of  two reasons 1. RESERVATION and 2. CORRUPTION. The overall  quality of administration has gone down. SC/ST employees threaten to falsely implicate superiors if asked to work.

1 0 Most honorable PM sir, let us make the BJP/modi ji's era India with no disable person as often we saw most of them in holly places or tourism places in India & also destroys India's image which is not hidden by anyone.

2 0 Respected PM ji, I want you to speak on the topic of Reservation on this auspicious day of Independence. On the basis of "give up LPG subsidy", there may be other movement like "Give up reservation". I have observed that there are many self-respecting families who have acquired good positions by using reservations. And if motivated they may give up the reservation of their children. This way, other reservation needy and poor families may benefits from this movement. it is just a suggestion.

2 0 Dear Mr Prime Minister Modi ji,
I would request you to speak on "Innovation in India" and how it can be nurtured in India - especially in the private sector. Innovative thinking is very very important among Indian citizens and it is the only way to create wealth among common man. Innovation is also the way to create great products across the world - Google, Apple etc...
Request you to speak on "Innovation in India" and how to nurture it among the citizens of this country.
Thanks,
Ram

1 0 Respected Mr. Prime minister, We have faith in your ideology. However, when we go to  govt. office the dream seems very distant. The procedures/processes and the executors of these have no idea on how much resources they are wasting by engaging in delaying tactics, corruption etc.A simple reissue of passport can take up as long as months, an active PAN card can be cancelled with annual taxes being deposited for a salaried employee with no reason, can we avoid these as its a huge notional loss.

0 0 Respected prime minister, most of the citizens of this nation remember all of their rights but forget their duties towards the nation and society. They talk big on patriotism but at working level they fail. They even cannot understand that these acts are the steps of nation building, like- switching off lights in public place (hostel,college), keeping campus clean, not spitting everywhere, plantation,complaining to PHED for broken water pipe,respecting women-not harassing them,not breaking queue

0 0 Respected Prime Minister,
I'd request you to give a speech which ENCOURAGES YOUTHS to involve in AGRICULTURAL FIELD. According to the young generation,occupation as a FARMER is considered as LOW-LEVEL occupation. Most of the EDUCATED PEOPLE choose to be a doctor or an engineer or an artist or a scientist,etc. But no one choose to become a FARMER. If this continues,farmers population REDUCES as time passes.And there will be hardly countable number of farmers in the country.

0 0 Respected Prime minister,
I'd like to suggest you to give speech about our NATIONAL GAME.Because in India if we ask a kid to name the cricket players he may be able to tell all the players,and even international players.But if we ask to name any 1 hockey player there will be no answer.Not only the kid but even if we ask an adult also there will be no answer. So make our citizens aware that our national game is Hockey not cricket.I'm not telling to discourage cricket but to encourage HOCKEY.

0 0 Respected Prime Minister,
In India due to the extensive use of fuels there may be scarcity of fuel in the upcoming years.Hence I kindly request you to encourage and make aware to farmers to grow plants like JATROPHA and HONGE which yields BIO FUEL. As JATROPHA is a hard plant which can grow on any type of soil,under any kind of agro-climatic condition,can easily propogated through seeds or stem cuttings. It grows very fast.Moreover it is not grazed by animals even during the periods of drought.

1.A 'SALUTE' on behalf of all citizens to the army,navy and military officials would be a great tribute.
2.Motivate 'YOUTH' of the nation,stressing their importance in realizing,Dr.APJ kalam's 'INDIA 2020' mission
3.It would be great if you could talk about tree plantation and insist school children to take part in it.
4.Please insist on making 'self defence'classes(karate etc) for girls mandatory at school level.

0 0 Our Parliament mansoon session was a failure due to handful peoples protest. Why not include some clauses in our law like nobody should protest in any kind inside the houses when sessions are going on. Any MP if absent on session day will loose his allowance and salary on prorata basis, nobody should speak more than the alloted time etc.?

0 0 Deadly diseases are increasing in the country. One of the main reasons for this is food adulteration and excessive use of pesticides. Almost everything we consume today is adulterated. For e.g. most of the fruits and vegetables we eat contain pesticides more than permissible level. Formalin is used for preserving food items. Some people even make artificial milk. Even the water we drink is polluted with pesticides, mercury and battery pollution.
Please something seriously for FOOD SAFETY.

I am civil engineering student.Ihave question about the reservation of the sc/st/obc. why reservation affects our regular life & career.Sir i am not the only one who have problem with reservation there many talent can be demotiavte by reservation. I have an example of my friend my one friend got rank near 2000 but he didn't get admission in main campass of i.p.u delhi.But my second friend got 16000 rank nearly and he got main campass of i.p.u because of he is s.c.

0 0 Being from defense background I have been seeing while travelling from Kanyakumari to Kashmir that the streets containing around 15-25 Tubes/LCD bulbs and  religious places having good watts of bulbs/Tubes are switched off around 7-8 AM and even some places it may go up to 10 AM. Same thing if it rains and even unnoticed after sunlight shine.

0 0 Many of our jawans and military officers have lost their lives fighting against Pakistan. Why not we construct housing projects for our Jawans and officers in border areas and allot to them and post them in these areas so that they will be with their families there and familier wirh the area so that no intruders will dare crossing the border. If any jawan or officers dies fighting enemies, their family should be given a house free of cost.

1. Discourage black vehicles as they have higher crash risk. They also consume more fuel.
2. Use bright colored school uniform to add visibility and thereby reduce accidents.
3. Use fluorescent paints/bright paints for cycles. No more black cycles.
4. A complete ban on advertisements involving dangerous stunts by drivers / riders, as kids children and youth will be influenced. Youngsters will imitate the same , small children will do it in future.

balajanasakhyam which is Asia's largest youth development club. I visited many such youth clubs in Trivandrum from that i came to know that most of the students are aware about it but none is comming froward to attend it .Sir, it imprtant please make the  students aware of it and we can hope for a good future for India

0 0 Sir, Since your speeches really pierced into everyone hearts and soul kindly make a request to switch off the light of Street and religious places early minutes of dawn i before 6.10 AM so as to save thousand Watts of current daily in one Village/Panchyat which we can utilize to many villages where poor farmers are in the dark as I have been doing daily this while going for morning walk at 6.10 AM in my village Narakal, Cochin and saving electricity for my country. Being from Defense background

0 0 One point everybody knows that India is a very young country w.r.t average age(around 29) of Indians .Key point is that if India has to become Superpower then next 5-10 years are very key for us and if we do not work hard during this time , we will miss this opportunity to become superpower for ever . This happened with Japan.So ideally a country needs to work hard when its Young to attain developed nation status .
Prime Minister should mention this fact in his speech and exhort people.

0 0 More than 1,50,000 people are killed in Road Accidents. Annual economic loss due to road accidents more than, Rs. FIVE LAKH CRORES. i.e. more than the double India's defense budget. 
Our financial experts are concerned about the GDP growth for the next year.
They are worried whether it will be 5.5 % or 6 %. Yes, they are concerned about even 0.5 %. But they are not concerned about the 3 to 4 % lost every year in road accidents. 
The issue has to be addressed with top priority.

Implement a new programme to transfer the facilities of Urban areas to our Rural areas under the name of late Sri.Abdul Kalamji.
Digitization of RT offices by linking vehicles with Adhar will help us to find out unfit and unauthorise vehicles
Improve our public markets under a Swachbharath

0 0 Ask to whole India to stop drinking crap like Coke and Pepsi. They are using huge potable water. And farmers are dying without water.

1 0 increase and apply the awareness on road safety and health yoga ,Environment and public health increase safety levels within government organization  identity the hazard and control implementing safe system on public road system

0 0 Swacha Bharat is a good idea but it will be a failier if sufficient waste bins are not kept in appropriate places. Many times after eating banana at road side I have to throw its skin there since no waste bins nearby. Multinational companies will be willing to install waste bins on road sides free of cost if a part of it is allotted for their advertisement.

0 0 15 August suggestion WORKING WOMEN s should be given more benefits.

0 0 Respected P.M
Following are a few suggestions that would help in the management of the election process
A voter should have a smart voting card just like he has an atm card
That smart voting card should have relevant data such as assembly, constituency,EPIC NO, serial no. Personal details etc and it should have a password like the pin for an atm card
The smart voting card should also have a swap machine provided by the Govt.
The voter should be able to cast his vote for his assemly constituency from any part of India
Hence the voter's vote will be counted in the same list as per his assembly constituency
The voter should be able to vote from his workplace too
Advantages:
There will be no bogus voting
There will be a considerable rise in the voting percentage
People will have a clearer view of the election
This are a few suggestions by a common citizen.
The Govt can work on and enhance these ideas with the help of experts

0 0 I wish that PM Modi should request peoples of India to keep their place of worship I.e. temples neat and clean. This work should be merged with clean my India campaign. It is generally seen that our temples specially in north India are not neat and clean. Place of worship should be clean. People of this country and PM should do something to get the temples clean. Thanks.

इंडिया की सोच वालों को भारत की हर संस्कृति सभ्यता पर शर्म आती है ।हिंदी का प्रयोग करने वालों को अपमानित किया जाता है ओछा समझा जाता है ।
इतिहास गवाह है की जिस देश ने अपनी संस्कृति पर गर्व नहीं किया वो देश पतन की और गया है ।

1 0 we Indians have tendency to criticize that we do in lok sabha also so instead of teasing each other we all should shake hands and work together rather than teasing on mom and son

1 1 plus instead of all these we should use tabs for education it would be less expensive over books plus students of village would not have to carry heavy loads and walk they would just carry a tab and walk so i would like you to stop cutting trees i 9 year old have a great faith in you that you will just at least read it

1 0 Sir, "Give it up"! It need not have to be pinpointed as to what you give up! The movement can start from as small as a gas subsidy to the President giving up his huge cavalry! In one of your runups to the LS elections you mentioned that placing the Budget papers in the Parliament was shifted from 5PM to 11AM only during Mr. Vajpayee's Govt as it was quite silly to follow the timings of the British Govt in an Independant India! Sir, India's Prez is neither from the BritishRaj nor a Maharaj!#GIU

1 0 sir you have discussed related all the topics but I student of class 3 wants you to discuss on education importance of education one thing i would like to suggest you that (don't take it as a taunt )America being the worlds richest country use the old books for students like it takes the book from previous class student and distribute it in new students but in our country lakhs of trees are cut and a new books are published each year so instead we should do slight change in old books and use it

1 0 Dear #PM sir, I have some suggestion for your #15thAugust speech:
*Please Introduce the self protection classes for girls like karatte, judo etc. , because police cannot protect girls or women's everytime and everywhere.
*It's important that the government takes a strong stand to maintain integrity of net neutrality.Cannot have internet based apps licensed or regulated,This defeats the purpose of the internet.
*New Colleges and Courses should be introduced in various universities.#MyGov

Sir. I am from kerala,also NRI return . Sir we people work overseas a long period after they came back to our mother land.About 80% of the people working overseas get a small money. They make this small money there and sent this money to our country.That small money also helping our country's economy.so Your govt need to start a loan scheme for NRI returners to start small scale industry,agriculture,animal husbantary.That hellpful for them

0 0 Respected Sir,
Kindly share ideas and views about providing Good Health/Medicine/Hospital services to our people. Pharma companies are killing the people by doing all unhealthy practices to bring their targets upto the mark by canvassing doctors and medical shops. Even if, the low cost medicine is available doctors will prescribe the most costly medicine available in the market just to satisfy the Pharma giant. Better hospital services needed for a healthy nation.

1 0 Sir,
We are living in the age of e-mail and mobile phone, but still in India our Govt. Departments use tonnes of paper for correspondence which is quite avoidable. The office order can be sent from official mail ids instead of sending huge number of paper prints.Similarly huge expenditure can be prevented ( on official tours by officers) by arranging video conferencing and phone calling. Kindly see the matter.

1. How can we make our children more responsible towards our society. If they plant trees in environment days or in their birthday ?
2. Every school should invite respected persons in various fields to addressed our future generation.

0 0 Respected sir,
I hereby propose a revolutionary suggestion to make our beloved motherland  an alcohol-free country and thereby saving millions of families from poverty and misery.
As Mahatma Gandhiji wished in his dreams,the first step towards total prohibition is to control the availability of alcohol.
I suggest the sale of alcohol in the country controlled through the Ration cards like the subsidy items.
I also suggest to deny sale of alcohol to BPL cards to save the poor families.Regards.

0 0 #IndependenceDay,Dear Pm,Indian citizens are enjoying an unimaginable freedom which cannot be compared to some of the countries. Indian citizens here are like Free birds. The sad part noticed is this freedom is being misused. Small changes in habitual action such as to stop spitting and littering in public places can add still more beauty to india's freedom rather than misusing them. Also people should stop damaging public properties and follow traffic safety rules. I urge you to stress.

0 0 Respected Sir,
             Salute to you Sir in enabling the citizens to interact with the Prime Minister of this great nation. My suggestion is that the caste based reservation that is in place in the country should continue; HOWEVER, THE RESERVATION FOR A CITIZEN HAS TO BE ONLY ONCE IN A LIFE TIME; EITHER FOR GETTING ADMISSION TO AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION OR FOR A JOB OR FOR GETTING PROMOTION IN A JOB.With best regards.

0 0 Sir;
Kindly declare “Bal Surakshya” (protection to school going children) for kids “the future of our country”. Strict action may be taken against school teachers/authorities (especially in private English Medium Schools) who are harassing kids mentally/physically and emotionally on the name of performance.Some Private English Medium Schools do this to achieve excellent result and thus commercialising education. This destroys creativity, innovation in thinking and natural mental growth.

1 0 Sir, We have the INDIA Gate which honors the Indian soldiers martyred in WORLD WAR-1 but none for INDIAN NATIONAL ARMY(AZAD HIND FAUZ), which was instrumental for our INDEPENDENCE. Unfortunately they were prosecuted in India(RED FORT TRIALS) not honored.About 35000 soldiers of 60000 strong force were martyred but we don't honor their memory.They were not even inducted back in Indian Army.
Sir, its time to give them their due. Its time to honor the real heroes of INDIA who gave us independence.

0 0 Narendra Modiji,
                A slong as the Composition of Rajyasabha is like this with a lot of stomch and heart burning will be creating troubles.and will not allow Rajyasabha function.So to pass GST Bill some other Route should be explored.

1 0 Respected Sir,
It is a kind request to announce a "Comprehensive One Rank One Pension Scheme" for our brave Ex-Servicemen by removing all procedural obstacles as this is very much required to boost the morale of armed forces and create a strong desire amongst the youth to join it. The issue is not only of money but mainly connected to the prestige and pride of this important job. I am sure that you can easily push through the scheme and get it announced in the very early part of your speech.

Please consider attached points in your Independence day speech.

0 0 After the unproductive monsoon session due to complete breakdown of discipline with an intent of non-national issue by the Congress but purely prejudicial, a passionate message from you on the subject will send out a clear message that you and your government mean business in the interest of the 125 crores Indians that includes all sections of the population.

Medical College, Health Department, PWD, Irrigation, Various Education Centers, Naga Maha Palika etc are come under these  sector. Some time even minister and MP, MLA also come.

After seeing our President Kalamji's (the most honorable exit from the physical world I have ever seen), wish that no holiday be declared on his death, at this juncture it might be very appropriate to call upon all honorble living dignitaries to give a similar clarion call.

1 0 Dear Sir, We shouldn't have to celebrate our "INDEPENDENCE DAY". It shows that, we were once been ruled by others as we were the suppressed, vanquish, concrete or subdued people at that time. when we celebrate this day, the countries that conquered us once will be proud themselves by thinking, how much power they had at that time to conquer a vast and broad HINDUSTAN by using there ideas and outlook. Don't make them feel like this.

I would like to tell one thing that we don't have a good road to travel even though we are paying road tax. why don't you enact a law which will held responsible the particular ministry,who is paid for doing his duty in a responsible way. They are telling that they don't have money for road repair but if PM or President comes, then they will make the road just like heaven. so sincerely I request central leaders to visit kerala regularly.

3 0 SAVE TREES:It's good we are moving to e-Governance,e-Kranti which reduces the paper use and save trees.But now a day thousands of trees are cut down to widen the roads.Bangalore (once famous Garden City), on an average loses 10,000 trees each year.The reasons are Infrastructure projects like road widening, flyovers, Metro rail, etc.If the same continued then Garden city should be renamed to Concrete city.Please do Abhiyan for saving forests as u did for cleaning India so that we can save nature.

1. My questions - Why didn't we call Joint parliament session even congress in not allowing important bills like GST and landline to pass in Rajya Sabha.
2. Rafale deal is in trouble again. Why can't we settle that in even 4 months ? Then what is quick decision making if we still cannot pass through Red tape. Nothing could be more important

0 0 Respected Prime minister,
Unemployment is one of the major issues that our country face for decades.Minister of labour should pay more attention and care about jobless.My humble suggestion is that Government of India must introduce labour card to all citizens doing all kinds of job whatever it may be including farmers,industrialist,professional,government/quasi government employees and even to politicians.The labour card shall be linked with Adhar.By doing so government subsidy can be minimized

0 0 My suggestion for Independence day Speech is to declare MAAF-i award:

MAAF-i award should be similar to Guiness Book/Limca Book of records and should be linked for the "Individuals' contribution in India's Development.

1 0 The work force in the IT sector in India is affected with the interstate life time road tax. Its high time we abolish it. We IT people travel between states to as part of our job assignments.

1. Implementing TWO CHILD PER FAMILY POLICY to control fastest growing population of World.
2. Installing PERMANENT DUSTBINS AT EVERY 20 METER in cities to make success for #SwachBharatAbhiyan. Here "Permanent" refers-- not like to fix only when any leader visits and install them on the way they visited only.
3. Encourage & aware RURAL PEOPLE/FARMER TO UTILISE RESOURCES by increasing Small Industry.

Sir, from Mother Earth we get the potable water and which is safely preserved as long as it’s under the ground. Still in millions of houses in our country, this nature’s precious gift can be seen going as waste, while pumping from bores.
I wish my Prime Minister to touch the issue of saving ground water during the Independence Day speech. If the issue is made a national issue, certainly we can change the water scenario in less than a decade.

0 0 the practice of cheating in exams and getting degrees by fraud is increasing day by day, in order to curb such practices a voluntarily program can be initiated where eminent person (civil servant, doctor, engineer, professor etc) should be encouraged to interact with the students of his/her village about the need of hard work and honesty in studies or every field of life. in order to inspire the young minds we need more and more local heroes.

0 0 इजराइल के पीएम का पुत्र सेना में शामिल होने जा रहा है,इजराइल में लगभग हर नेता,मंत्री और सांसदों के पुत्र सेना में शामिल होते है,भारत के नेताओ को कुछ इजराइल से भी सीख लेनी चाहिए

हमारे यहाँ भारत में तो नेताओ के पुत्र तो सिर्फ सांसद और मंत्री की बनना चाहते है और उनके नेता बापो ने जितना बड़ा घोटाला किया है उससे भी बड़ा घोटाला उनके पुत्र करते है और वोटो के लिए आज के नेता आतंकियों को अपने पार्टी में शामिल कर लेते है और आतंकियों का खुला समर्थन करते है और वोट के लिये देश में आतंक फैलाते है

1 0 Younger generation is not inclined to take up farming. In order to encourage them into farming farm income must increase consistent with other options available.Unfortunately technology related decisions are taken on ideological grounds not for their scientific merits. Let farm policies be framed on the underlying scientific facts.As we lack storage facilities, we are unable to hold stocks till we get the nest price.We need good storage & marketing facilities. We need robust AgriInsurance policy

0 0 For future of Green India can we pledge on 15th August tat every one in PMO,MP,MLA, person who is working in parliament & in govt offices can plant a tree & pledge to take care of that plant till next election or retirement let govt & his employees set an example not big corporates. Link the growth of plant with the person individual career & financial growth.Why not tax reduction for planting trees/plant. We need to secure environment than only we can enjoy freedom. Jai Hind

SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS.as these are under state govt. and state govt. are corrupt,so start govt. schools and hospitals funded by central govt. in each district. coumtry will develope only when its people will be educated.

0 0 Though our farm yield has increased whether it is food crop or fiber,our farmers are not happy. Income from farming isn't adequate.Many fall in debt trap & take extreme step of ending lives.Agriculture Ministry is concerned only about food production not farmers welfare.Restructure this ministry as Agriculture&Farmers Welfare Ministry.Ravichandran,President UFEI

You are an astute person.This suggestion may sound "chote muh badi baat". Yet as I love you, I will take risk of writing.
Raja Prithvi Raj Chauhan was a great warrior but also kind to his enemies.Mohammed Ghazni attacked him 11 times. Raja won each time and pardoned him. On the 12th occasion, Raja lost. Ghazni promptly blinded him.
Congress is modern Ghazni. Hit them hard. Be like Shivaji. Income tax returns,businesses,investments are few areas to attack.Regards

1 0 Dear SIR, India is far behind or just being a developing country due to this corruption. Hence, we loose our ethics and integrity. But i don't think it can be ever stopped, even developed countries are corrupted. So, my suggestion is you can ask the PEOPLE of INDIA for at-least 1 year in every field not to be corrupted and hence, tell them to FEEL the change in THEMSELVES & OUR INDIA (JUST 1 YEAR).

0 0 Respected Modi Ji, I feel that inculcating the national character among all citizens of our country, is the need of hour and it can be rooted from childhood from the school-days by my dedicated teachers. I still remember well them by names. Present days private schools have become a business centres for earning huge money in various forms with exploiting the parents of boys & girls with dismal contribution towards patriotism.Honesty & courage is the biggest human property which taught in schools

0 0 Respected Prime Minister Sir, I have following suggestions :
1. Consideration of making kennels or enclosures for stray dogs at Panchayat levels and feeding them which should be taken care of by govt. and local bodies.
2. Institute Agricultural and forestry and horticulture awards in line with film awards.   3. The trainfrom Karnataka to Kannur should be extended up to Guruvayur or a new express train started which can be named Pilgrim special.

0 0 Happy to know about this thought provoking action. I would request you to include the "Importance of pursuing Higher Education in India", as many of the Young folks flying away for Foreign countries for higher studies. And also widen the opportunities to Learn Better in our IITs, IIMs, etc.,

0 0 Corruption today can be called a malaise attached to the largest democracy of the world i.e. India. From getting your birth certificate to your driving license to getting a loan passed to build your home, nothing goes without giving a bribe.

0 0 Respected Sir,
Generally we the civilians are unaware rather insensitive about the difficulties involved in the Military life.
For graduation, we have to choose any one course among NCC, NSS or ordinary Physical Training. But this compulsion was not there for those students who externally pursue graduation.
I would like to suggest that these NCC/NSS should be separated and must be made mandatory to every person before that person attains the age of 25 years, as a part of National Policy.

0 0 Honorable Prime Minister, My regards as a citizen of India for your strong will to make India better than before. Its my honor to be part of that and thanks for giving such an opportunity to share my ideas.
Respected Sir, I want to propose an idea which is very much align to your swach bharat mission. Sir, My idea is to implement a "clean school project".This should not be a self initiative but a strict rule to include one academic subject towards cleanliness and planting trees.
Thanks,

0 0 Dear Sir, we draw your attention to urgent issues concerning our bhashas.  1. Destruction of a language is destruction of life,  of a whole civilization. 2. Bhashas are indispensable in the exercise of democracy &  for effective governance. 3.   As sources of indigenous knowledges they empower our citizens. 4. Their use in modern economy is essential for equality of opportunity. 5. Skill development in Bhashas is essential for Make in India. 6. Digital India should therefore integrate bhashas.

0 0 Respected Prime Minister ,REGARDS. Please make some very strong policies for making  the education system free of corruption.Admission in Medical colleges,engineering,IIMs should not be a matter of a few privileged people.Please include in your speech your plan for common men's children's higher education in reputed institutions.Getting admission to such institutions  should be accessible to everyone irrespective of class,high /low merit,poor,rich.Please make it accessible to everyone.

I hope you would also agree to the fact the members of Honourable Parliament have wasted the valuable public time and money.
I would like to ask one question why this money should not be recovered from their remuneration?
Can there be an Accountability Bill for the MPs?

0 0 VERY VERY URGENT - I don't how the msgs are screened but I request you to consider this for today: SIR PLEASE ASK PARLIAMENT HEAD TO CREATE A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT TO SOLVE THE CONCERNS OR ALLEGATIONS MADE BY ANY PARTY ON ANY INDIVIDUAL SO THAT IT DOESN'T HAMPER THE REASON PARLIAMENT STANDS FOR & PEOPLE ARE PAID FOR - ITS A FORUM TO DISCUSS THE COUNTRY GROWTH AND NOT INDIVIDUALS.

Thanks to you!
Please sir think about it...

0 0 Sir we should talk about importance of constitution, 70%people don't know about constitutional rights,acts, , this leads to anarchy, like protest of people on SC judgment, riot, tension in society, so every person should atleast read constitution once,,
We should make awareness about IMPORTANCE OF CONSTITUTION
And about rights like freedom of speech, freedom of expression,,,,, that's the need of society

0 0 sir,i think your topic for speech should be india-hand to hand because make in india can only possible if every single citizen of our country undrstnd its value every citizen who is educated should help others to undrstand exactly what is make in india because if we go in villages there are many small workers whoes work is not less than a famous artist so what is required to do is to encourage that talent so if any one who know this type of talent post that info in site like mygov.in ..

0 0 WE CAN'T STALL A NATION GROWTH JUST FOR A PARTY CONCERNED ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL PERSON......Please make necessary changes in the parliament and ask everybody to focus on country's growth and not pulling each other legs. All the people who wants to see India grow will back you for this. Its pathetic to see what congress doing by just concentrating on single issue related to an Individual person where the whole nation (1,284,576,902-1-congress) looking for changes and growth in India.

0 0 The PM should discuss about its foreign security policy, opposition roles in barring important rules & act. Should also think about the "giving up of subsidy" which the common man think that it only applies on them.  Mister PM should also tell his views on improving education system in India.

0 0 We have to improve our primary education system to eradicate all most all problems faced by our nation. Now our system gives least important to primary education up to tenth standard. The government is trying to run away from this responsibility by not providing sufficient funds and infrastructure to our schools in government sector. You may try to strengthen our primary education system. For this first abolish the contract appointment system of school teachers in government sector.

0 0 sir please ask Congress to give proofs to show whatever they are claiming or to KEEP QUITE. Parliament is not running for Lalit Modi or any individual for that matter and it should not be a stage to discuss the same.

Please ask them to go to court, if they have proof for their allegations and if proved, court will take the proceedings.

0 0 As we all know that female foeticide is a crime and social disaster. All the laws should be strictly followed by the every citizens of India. keeping a close watch on the pregnant women for six months. A special committee is to be formed within the federation, where main job would be to keep a watch on pregnant women.Activate advisory, planning supervisory committees to work closely with the district administration and block-level officers of various departments like health, nutrition, police.

0 0 My suggestion is for providing special treatment to Parents, spouse & childrens of Shahid & On duty defense persons at any Govt. as well as private offices by providing special ID cards by defense ministry. By availing the special treatment to their families will not only generate sense of pride in the hearts of Solders and their families but also ignite feeling of respect in common peoples heart as as well (that too on regular basis and not on some special days only). Just imagine Sir.

1 0 I would request you to think about:
1) Stopping any further growth in Capital Cities, as each State is thinking of growing only their capital forgetting the other locations in the state. Of course without disturbing the Heritage places of each States.
2) Remove Caste System in education and Govt Jobs. Every State board and Central board is having the same syllabus and question paper for the exams, then why to discriminate the effort of a student. Let them get the seat based on performamce.

0 0 How about installing travelators (similar to ones in airport) across the town to help commute from one place to another?
This self power generating setup can be done at a certain height above ground level either close to the main roads or above the service roads
This will help individuals (with less baggage)to reach the destination much faster than any other mode. With the option to walk (instead of stand)on the travelator, the individual can cover large distance within a short period of time.

2 0 Sir,
 A hard warning to Pakistan is the need of hour.
Our legislative institutions are heading towards dysfunctional state. 
Appointment of a commission for fixation of pay and allowances of people representative.
Emphasis on agriculture and improving conditions of farmers.
Enhancement of education and defence budget.
Kindly mention these points in your budget speech.

2 0 sir,As we are entering into the realm of smart cities, we need to be careful about the Environment too. Development and Environment should go hand in hand.
I propose a unique idea of ‘Environmental Ambulance’ to serve the Ecology and Environment.
we want to create Love and Respect for our environment amongst our citizens.
The ‘Environambulance’ may be called PRAYAAN (A Journey towards better environment).
Providing education related to environment and ecology and Creating awareness

2 0 And According to me,its a request to you pls take up the issues of reservation also.At least do something for unreserved student.due to reservation many student feel problem infact they do not get a good job.mai ye nahi kahti ki aap reservation khatm kar de but you should change something.and congress ko muh tor jabab dijiye.. Modi ji aap se bht umid h..

1 0 sir,I suggest you to develop women and children centric gardens around the city and villages Woman is mother,woman is symbol of love and piety still we have neglected her in many ways.
she is not safe and very much delimited by self raised restrictions and social obligations.
I have thought of providing her some relaxed moments where she can be joyous, contemplative & lighthearted consequentially get herself reinvented, reanimated and relaxed.
It is one of our Endeavour to women empowerment.

0 0 Ideas, Opinions, Topics & Thoughts for PM's Independence Day Speech.

2 0 plz. ponder upon the scarcity of drinkable water and fresh water and ever increasing polluting of water bodies.Local water bodies like bawadi's,Vav's,step wells and lakes are in derelict condition  in Rajasthan and all over the country.these are beautiful built structures and will be very much needed in future for fresh water needs and can be tourism friendly.I been cleansing and maintaining these still we all countrymen should take part in cleaning and making fresh water a reality.

0 0 Another sector where the Government should give attention is old age. Even the pensioners are struggling to meet their medical bills as after 55 or 60 when they retires they carry many diseases with them for which medication becomes a necessity. Therefore   free medicines and treatment to old aged people or at subsidised rates. The private hospitals, pharmacies and institutions can contribute part of their huge profits to these. aged > 60 yrs may be given old age pension <=2000.

0 0 Dear Sir, let me start by wishing you a Very Happy Independence Day.
1.Revisit all the schemes and missions that you had started last year and most of which have already stopped working. Rather than starting something new, if you can make the bureaucracy take up these stalled works, India would be a better country to live in.
2. Do show a way for educated youth of the country to participate in nation building activities, like teaching in schools
3. Bring reforms in Bureaucracy, long overdue

0 0 It must be made clear to the youth and citizens that every one couldn't be given Government jobs. They must be encouraged to become job givers as you mentioned in  your speech during the inauguration of Digital India Week. Hence entreprenurship development activities must be given emphasis.

0 0 Sir,Request you to take up issues of poverty and education.In India these two thing are main issues.Sir aap se request hai pls aap apne wade se na mukre.Today every Indian feel proud to be you as a PM aur apko hero mante h aaj ke yuva,aap se gujarish h aap rajniti ke samsayo me jyada uljhe huye nagar aa rhe h aise me aap se desh ki jo nagrik ho khush nhi h..And I think One thing is also important issue i.e reservation.Pls go ahead through this.

2 0 Swatch Bharat Abhiyaan got stopped somewhere. The local bodies should be empowered to fine the individuals or groups who throw the wastes on the pavements and road/waysides.It has to be made the responsibility of every individual to clean and keep their environment clean.The Residents Associations could be empowered for this.Incentives or promotional plans may be made in collaboration with shops and merchants in that area. Individuals should be fined for urinating or excreting on the roadside

0 0 Sir,due to lack of proper facility and awareness people living in backward areas of villages do not understand any need of sending their children to schools.Some people even force their children to do work and earn money when those children are expected to go to school.The issue of child labour is more common in the children who are orphans.The proper guidance and implementation of certain solid actions are expected from your side as soon as possible.Please think about it.

0 0 Dear Modiji,
I would like to give one suggestion regarding the importance of registered residence associations (APEX Council) in India. I think probably their involvement also be very important whenever doing any development in their cities and towns. Those kinds of changes should definitely help your effective agenda implementations in each state of the cities and towns.  Kindly provide more transparency to the registered residence associations about the developments like new roads etc....

0 0 Sir,
Request to take up issue of increase in property prices in last 10 years(since around 2004). Its submitted that property prices in country specially metros have increased multifold (mostly in range of 15-50 times the prices of properties in 2004) while avg income per household for corresponding period increased only 2-3 times, thus creating a wide gap in property prices & income of avg middle class indian. request to look into it to bring down property prices linked to avg family income.

0 0 Dear Prime Minister,
I'm writing to you because it seems that now our words can be reviewed by our government. Earlier it was not like that and I really thank you for building such platform where anybody can just share their thoughts. I'm glad to know that your first task is almost complete (equipping the schools with separate toilets for boys and girls). This shows that your government is capable of taking responsibilities and can fulfill them in due time. As a citizen of India, I'd like to hi

0 0 Respected Prime Minister
I would like to suggest that Elementary  education upto 10th standard should be   made free and compulsory .   Further a topic on morals and values should be added to  the curricular .  By this we are not  only educating  the youths of today  as far as academic    is concerned  but also teaching them right  morals, values , conducts  etc… which  they will abide   at a very young age .  By doing so we  are providing complete education to the children.

0 0 Sir, I think its time that your speech addresses the cancer of the congress party. Also I think you need to elaborate on your achievement from the previous independence day and also your plans for developing till the next one. As a nation, we are seeing growth happen but this is interrupted due to laws and regulations  being stalled in parliament. I hope this is also elaborated. Apart from these I think our neighbors should also be sent a clear message to ensure that they know their limits

0 0 After 10th standard,  short courses of 3-6 months  should be provided based  on childs strength and also family requirements such as on agriculture  , manufacturing , services etc.. .
Request you to kindly revert back on the above.
Many thanks

1 0 Deadly diseases are increasing in the country. One of the major reasons for this is Food Adulteration and excessive use of pesticides. 
This has to be addressed by strengthening the Food Safety department in the country, at national level and at state level. 
Food Safety department has to be completely reformed in line with FDA of USA. Simply enacting laws and rules will not help. Existing rules are to be strictly implemented. Food sampling has to be increased many fold, may be 1000 times.

0 0 DEAR PRIME MINISTER,
I would like you to speak about the growing population and its impact on the growth of our country. Because the people of our nation must know that it is difficult for any government to create employment opportunity for such a fastest growing population. More over a family must have that many number of  kids where in they will be able to fulfill the basic requirements of food, clothing, shelter, health and education so that this children become an asset to the nation

1 0 You could urge citizens to care about ONE POOR FAMILY. Not financially, but to keep informing about their rights, new schemes , help them take right decisions financially or in their career making.

1 0 The most serious issue of road accidents to be addressed. It may be noted that more than 1,50,000 people are killed in road accidents in the country. Economic loss due to this is more than 5 LAKH CRORES. i.e. more than twice our defense budget !!!

0 0 now a days i feel that our country is being divided according to the communist. if we works all together for country not to be divided according to communist, there is a question raise in mind what can i do for that ?
firstly make a leader of all the communist and then organize a meeting and then listen there problem, and then according to there problem we make the solution .

0 0 #PM Parliament Functioning:- I would request to please introduce No work No Pay at the time of parliamentary session are held. As this elected members of Parliament dose not spend their money for travel, stay , food etc at this time. This is our Tax payers money. Now a hardstand should be taken to ensure that if you don't let run the parliament you are not entitlement for any perks and all expenses should be borne by them. "Carrot and Stick Principle" which is applicable in Industries

2 0 Defense Bank A/c
Govt. should open an PAN India account for our forces (Air/Land/Navy). People can donate money in this account which should be tax free. Media should be involved to spread awareness & information of this account. Top 10 donaters should be awarded on 15th Aug. & 26th Jan. in front of citizens of India. Then there will be more than sufficient fund available to process all major & minor requirement of defense. Also People of India (Industrialist, businessman, Donators etc.) proud

2 0 LAND ACQUISITION and GST Bill could be briefed to people that how much it's beneficial and necessary for India. So that outside pressure could be created at parties.

0 0 3.	As you know the govt. is spending a big  amount  in professional courses like Medicine, engineering etc.  Those who are taking the benefits of govt. fund should give this back by service.  So they should compulsory  serve in India for a minimum period of five years, Rural service.

1 0 Health care:  There should be some regulation in the fee structure for doctors, hospital’ labs etc.  Now it is not there in India.  As you know a doctor can take Rs.1000.00  or Rs.50.00  depending on the place of service.  There is a needed MRP or MPR (Max. practice price) here.  This is most important if you think the poor also should get good healthcare facility.

0 0 It's not the people just fear to Donate ORGAN, but they most people don't even know that such thing happens.

1 0 1.	Parliament   :  All the elected representatives are answerable to the public.  Any one disrupting the house should be debarred for 10years.  For salary, attendance  for whole day should be made mandatory.  On the percentage of attendance MPs pay and perks to be decided  because it is our money  and we want to know the productivity of each representative.
	Before considering an increase in pay to the MPs there should an opinion polls with 	80% participation across India.

0 0 Rape have still not deceased in the capital. You could say something about that including whole India's state.

0 0 India has huge paucity for ORGAN DONATERS. People still fear to donate the organs or even blood. We have huge population. If 10 Lakh people can leave subsidy. Then definitely many can pledge to some organisation to donate BLOOD/ORGANS.

0 0 This year let the country know that we are not divided and will not be,not on the basis of religion,nor on caste.So,in this regard lets pledge that we will not cast votes on the basis of these dividing factors.Lets pledge we will have clean politics and policies not based on appeasing a particular class that will serve as future vote banks but policies that will serve people and build strong foundation for a stronger nation.Let year be the year of celebrating togethernes irrespective of division

0 0 Pls urge ppl for ORGAN DONATIONincluding eye donation and blood donation. They must be promoted at large.

0 0 Sir, The main prblm facing the people is non devopt of Rds. In Kerala even in Highways, the average width is less than 15m.  Due to political influence, land acquisition is impossible. All the Agri/Wet lands are being converted to Dry lands for constr of ms bldgs. I suggest that all the lnds adjacent to rds be acquired and permitted to constr ms bldgs in the rds leaving sufficient space for smooth tpt below the bldgs keeping all safety measures.so we can protect our Agrl, Wet lands, Envrnmt etc.

1 0 Agriculture Census
While undertaking  my research on agriculture sector, i faced difficulties of existence of crop yield data at village level, since the agriculture department of  state  not having the data at micro level. At that point of time this idea clicked in my mind that in every village, village panchayat with the help of panchayat secretary can conduct the agriculture census. By this, real time data on agriculture can be available readily.
this idea posted at ideas for CM at MP

0 0 dear sir,
there should be special programs and packages to support NRIs and their dependants living in India.

0 0 appeal citizens to have 'prem bhav' each other which has solution for many problems which happened in our daily life and tell them that 'gandgi'is a negative thing which spread darkness in our life and stops growth of our children, our family,our nation and world. Because people get ill due to it and and they curse somethiong else or sometime to each other.

0 0 As I pass through many inside areas, I found that many people have no good roads to their home. They can just walk through the path, which is also a good distance from main road. Even though roads are the right for the property, it is only enough for walking. In the present situation and progress of the country, I believe, everybody should get a path where at least a maruti alto can pass through. If government can make it a law, it will beneficial for lakhs of poor people.

1 0 Hi Sir, I have a suggestion about the law. The judicial system, the protectors of law and the leaders should have more punishments than the normal citizens. If it happens, they would be more cautious and alert which will force even the public to protect the laws. A student fighting with another student and a teacher fighting with another teacher and a principal fighting with another principal should be treated in different perspective. Equality doesn’t matter here, though the crime is same.

0 0 Sir,
Please take care of our farmers and agriculture.
The population is going like anything, however the earth is not growing. What we will do for our next generations for food and water? where is land for agriculture,Acres of land being converted for residential and industrial revolution, every one is moving to industry or business, the farmers are not getting any benefit,
We have a hope on you, hence please take care our farmers and their land.

0 0 When roads needed to be broadened, instead of widening roads, build another road parallel to this road 50 m away	 so that shops and employees will not lose their income, in addition there will be more shops along another road and more income developed to more people. Also land take over money can be decreased about 50%. Another advantage of this is there will only one side travel in one road which will decrease lot of accidents due absence of divider. Three lines in one road, one for fast travel

0 0 Caste based separation is one of the reason that stops India to move together; and caste based reservation encourage people to be in their own community and to marry from same caste . Why cant we encourage inter-caste/inter-religion marriages and introduce reservation for those people who marry from different caste/community. On a later point we will be where the people are out of caste and just "Indians".So we can completely avoid caste-reservation as Ambedkar dreamed in "annihilation of caste"

0 0 Sir, 
Namaste. 1. am happy that your government has a great foreign policy. Please continue the good work there. 2. This is the time to get a direction for Indian exports. I have a detailed plan to work on increasing the India's exports so that we can have a better balance of payments position. I need time with your officials to talk about it. 3. Your independence address should rejuvenate our industry 4. Please address tax issues. Please don't raise them anymore for any sectors

0 0 re Swachh Bharat Abhiyan - an integrated message re the work so far, and the path ahead, will be very helpful to keep the momentum from flagging. One way of describing the work so far, and the path ahead is a "Motor Car Model" Details of model are in chapter in book by Syama Prasad Mookerjee Foundation on "One year of NM Govt - Redefining Governance", published last month, editor, Dr Anirban Ganguly. It can be a very powerful way of conveying to the country re the Abhiyan.

1 0 As part of CLEAN-GREEN India, develop a programme in-order to reduce the usage of paper in the govt. departments as well as to dispose off the unwanted papers in various govt. offices

0 0 The Central Government must start orphanages, homes for old age people and beggar homes in all the districts in the country. Then ban begging. This way we can cut down the crimes,  of kidnappings of children for begging . Moreover the activities of some of the NGOs who are engaged in anti-national activities can be curtailed by this move. Some of these NGOs are getting huge funds from abroad by highlighting the poverty in our country.

0 0 Every citizen can plant one tree a month for next twelve months in his living area.The trees can be rain forest trees specially procured from Latin American countries.Government should distribute free of cost.These trees will fetch enough rainfall and drought can be a thing of the past.Mr Lee had done this in Singapore.Therefore we can also do this in India.It should be a mass movement by all Indians with support of Government.

0 0 Sir, Can we give our children an experience of richness/diversity of India when they are at school? There are over 1000 Kendriya Vidyala (KV) and over 600 Navodhaya schools (NS) located across the country. What if we facilitate 7th or 8th standard students the option of studying in some other KV or NS on a mutual exchange basis with the host family? The student would see new place, make new friends,stay with the new family and learn new culture. Richness of India experienced. Jai Hind.

                 I am a civil service aspirant. I am very much annoyed of the detrimental effects of Global Warming in our society.I sincerely feel that our youth can contribute a lot to reduce it. 
    For that i personally opine and request the government to promote the usage of bicycles among youth through 'PEDALLING INDIA'scheme against the widespread usage of motor bikes. The govt can promote this through PPP initiatives. This can also reduce life style diseases.

0 0 Dear Modiji;

2)Why not central govt corporate with State govt to start Govt owned hotels/Tea stalls across the country.

1 0 Most of the Indian rupee goes in purchasing the crude oil,petroleum to reduce this cost alternate methods like cycles,walking,boats etc.very useful but motivation is required.

0 0 Announce the formation of an All India database of missing citizens and another for 'lost and found'/vagabonds/child beggars.. Matching the 2 databases with even a small percent of success might help thousands of lost and loved ones to be found all over India.

0 0 I just want to add a word on Reservation also. it is the time to remove the reservation criteria on cast. On financial background we can set up the reservation criteria. Now rich people from backward community is getting reservation and all benefits from the govt. and poor people from forward cast compelled to bear the burden of the liabilities.

So i want u to appeal from such important forum to seek right timely help for Depression so that we can save young backbone of our country & save lifes from suicides.

0 0 Proverty is one of the main crisis we have. I know we are having several policies to help the poor people. But most of them are discounts or benefits which they can avail. My suggestion we should have a clear plan for how to help them to go above proverty line & self-sufficient. May be by providing agricultural land/assisting them to start small scale business.

2 0 Sir we need to modify our education system, state syllabus etc according to the needs of developing world. Because nowadays government schools are facing difficulties to survive. Private CBSE/public schools are growing. Its not egg, milk and delicious food which attracts students to school its the best education from the school which develops their personality, culture, thought process etc  through acquiring knowledge which is adequate for future.

0 0 First of all behaviour of some parliamenterians inside the Parliament and its remedy.No one has the right to play with the future of the country as some are playing. They must be condemned on this day,as the soul of Gandhi ji is crying.The country and its people are very very anguished. These people are doing anything by enjoying everything. I request u sir please don't let them do as they wish and get away.U fix the accountability for each peny of tax payers money.U will be remembered forever.

2 0 PM should address nationalizing rivers and water resources, also need to talk about connecting revers to avoid rain water wastage. As Gandhiji stated, agriculture is backbone of India, so agriculture as a subject should be included in secondary education curriculum. Today many highly educated professionals want to cultivate and do agriculture, as lack of knowledge in agriculture all hesitate to proceed further.
Should focus on digitalizing, E-Governance in all govt sectors to reduce corruption

0 0 i have a plan in black many corrption

0 0 I think that PM should try to evoke feeling of Nationalism in the country. we are not from different states,we all are of India. The incidences of terrorism along the border are increasing he should cite the bravery of two guys who nabbed the terrorist. apart from this i think he should extend the idea of selfie with daughters. swach bharat abhiyan needs a mention again as not much has been achieved on ground. mention what happened in monsoon session due to power-hungry people.

0 0 यह सुनकर अच्छा लगा कि सक्षम लोग सब्सिडी छोड़ दें। अति प्रसन्ता होती अगर सक्षम लोग आरक्षण छोड़ देते। इक्कीसवी सदी का दौर है और नियम बीसवीं सदी के। तब की बात कुछ और रही है और अब समाज बदल रहा है, कुरीतियाँ ख़त्म हो रही है। मानती हूँ कि पिछड़े इलाकों में अब भी बहुत सुधार होना बाकि है तो क्यों न आरक्षण पिछड़े वर्ग को दिया जाये।
#PM #IndependenceDay

0 0 Abhiyan like 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' should be launched to achieve 100% literacy (every citizen should be able to read and write his native language).

0 0 #IndependenceDay My idea may not be big enough but if included in the speech might help.  
- Giving way to ambulance so that lives are save
- To tell citizens how they can be useful in boosting Indian economy
- Inform about those bills that were not passed in Monsoon sessions becoz of some selfish people

0 0 Some should be done for removal of Reservation System

0 0 An important point of reference in the Hon'ble PM's address from the Red Fort needs to be as to how to draw up mechanism so as to see to it that education reached the last child in the remotest area of our country. THIS IS TO SAY, ON GROUND, NOT ON THE TABLE OF THE BUREAUCRATS OF VARIOUS HUES, AS IS THE CASE PRESENTLY, NOTWITHSTANDING WHATEVER IS CHURNED OUT VIA DIFFERENT OFFICIAL CHANNELS. THE GROUND-REALITY SPEAKS ABOUT VOLUMES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE DONE, JALANDHAR CITY BEING NO EXCEPTION.

0 0 I have a scheme in one year no person of 18 years or above will be  unemployed.

1 0 By increasing marriage age of girl to 21, which is equal to boy, we can control population growth. By this girl can complete her study. At least they get graduation degree that may lead to getting a job. If this in place first delivery will be at the age of 22. Then they think about maximum 2 children. This is one of the best way to reduce population growth with out imposing any rule. By imposing law to reduce population may bring criticism from various religious leaders.

0 0 Hi sir,
     Your thoughts are very good.I like to give one point here related to our Educational system: Our education system are very good but not effectively implemented in schools and colleges. Peoples those are finishing their studies they are expecting campus interviews only instead if any schemes for young peoples, to utilize them it for new business opportunities by providing appropriate facilities by govt., may increase the employability.The knowladge problem with both staff &Students.

0 0 Sir,
Fake Institutions are depleting the life of a youth. Even some prestigious colleges are giving admissions to the 12th failed student. Indeed this is decresing the quality of an ENGINEER.
Lakhs of student appear in the IIT/AIEEE exams and only thousands of student make their selection. I hope we will se more govt courses and govt institution which will help students to get job. Kindly look into this matter. #PM #MyGov

0 0 Dear Sir
I am proud to be an Indian since our system is better than most of other nations. Our system is always enriching with lot of values as well as justice. We need to continuously upgrade our system for the equal justice to all people. Caste based reservation is very good effort by our system for justice to poor and backward people. Any system to improve backward is good but please make sure the target/ quality should not be compromised

0 0 Hi Sir,
I've seen many students who are going to the schools but due to the regular absence of teachers in govt schools and  proxy attendance by teachers, these students are not having regular classes.
There was also in recent news 98,500 govt schools are running by single teacher.
So this shows that we are not inspecting the schools regularly and due to this primary education is really lacking.In recent days they are cases where child labour is incrsg in port areas around gujarat,A.P etc.

0 0 “TECHNOLOGY”.
Since my 1st visit to USA (out of India for the very 1st time), I realized the power of Technology. I remember you had described @ bringing in ‘Technologies’,in your speech after you become PM and I truly admired the same. Sir, ASAP we need to implement AS MUCH AS electronic media/technology/gadgets right from roads to our homes! an Eg: just 1 mandatory INDIAN ID card, linked with PASSPORT,bank/PAN details,vehicle registration, insurance.. Similarly-speed guns/cameras on highways.

0 0 Dear PM,
I would like to suggest two points,
1. To make Swatch Bharath more effective, waste containers should be kept in easy reachable areas in all public places & should be maintained properly by the respective departments.
2. Agricultural sector in INDIA should be given further more importance along with other national development schemes. Agricultural contributions from each states should be evaluated at National Level. Organic Farming should be promoted.

0 0 If there could be any such arrangement where people could be employed locally then a huge consumption of fuel in transport sector could be checked which will surely drive a sharp cut to air pollution and the time wasted in traffic jam too. Thus where in one hand we could enhance our productivity by utilizing the wasted time, in the other hand it would support our movement against Global Warming. Moreover if the official work could be done by sitting at home then there's nothing better than this.

0 0 According to me, the independence day speech should contain broad details on the achievements made on the announcements made in the last independence day speech.  It should also contain some concrete details on the achievements made on the Development front in the period up to now. A concrete roadmap for GST and Land Bill will impose confidence into the people and hence should be included in the speech.

0 0 For a developing country Like INDIA what is the NEXT chapter. One thing is Digitization which we are on top of it. But there is something serious which is holding back us from the "Developed" tag
Yes that is nothing but the Non-proportionate Population against the Infrastructure of our country . I think this is the high time to enforce the law to control the birth rate like in case with China..We must initiate a campaign to make the people of INDIA aware of this from the grass root level...

0 0 please implement GST .Govt department mai GYAN AUR VIVEK ke adhikar ko khatam karo and fix the liability of assessing authourity, if anyone doing wrong because of there position they should pay for it.

0 0 Respected Narendrabhai,
It is nice that you had started Cleanliness Movement.  The System needs thorough cleanliness.  You need to take some Harsh Actions.  Not allowing the parliament to run is also Corruption.  I appreciate your stand of suspending the MPs.  Please withdraw their salary and perks for those days.
As a good indication to nation, please also declare the return of parliament perks for yourself and your colleagues during parliament closure days.  Wish you All the Best

0 0 and the experts should speak on each of the clause(not a single one should be left)in the bill as there remains no room for doubt..This program should be broadcasted 24*7 on few of the national channels  including a radio station...This program should be executed under your honorable flagship...This program should be undertaken for all the bills pending in the parliamnent after the success of one..

It's an honour to write before u.I would like to share my opinion before u which is in nations interest.M deeply hurted the way parliament is being functioned & crores of rupees are being wasted on each day proceedings without any outcome.Say on GST bill u can setup a platform at particular place(as big as a rally but at particular place) with few of the experts whom a particular timeframe is being alloted say 72 hours & this program is broadcasted as big as an election campaign..

0 0 Respected PM Modiji,Quality education at all levels should be focuss of your naton building,particularly primary education.If it is taken care other things will beautomaticlly follow.Certain points to ponder.1,reorganize theschools in the rurai area and make them effectively functioning units.22,make sigle teacher schools as pre schools3.a vey strict recruitment of meritorius teachers4.every unit
      of school must be well equipped say within a radius of 5km6bus   transport from every villge

0 0 Respected Sir
I may like  to add in your speech for all citizens of India to do their duty or job Honestly . If they do so, most of the problems in the country will be solved automatically. For cleanliness one should not throw waste items here and there. Reg. Employees if they feel that any of his or her blood relation can be in the Queue they can do it fast and correct.

1 0 Sir,
I feel this independence day you should  declare about scraping MCI screening test for our students studying overseas.
Sir,the students are studying in universities recognised by our MCI,they have same syllabus,well established examination and all.But again a filtration barrier in our country called MCI SCREENING TEST,are choosing US and western countries to continue their profession.
I request you to propose an initiative from this govt.to get the medical students to serve our patients.

0 0 Dear Modi Ji,
As a resident of Assam and would like to turn your attention to the persistent problem of illegal Bangladeshis here. They make huts in hills, grab land, cause unrest; many cases of theft have also been there. Parts of Kaziranga, Lower Assam, Guwahati are their safe haven. The Aadhar card which is now optional, Should be made mandatory in Assam. Also the Indo-Bangla Border should be properly monitored and fenced. 
Or else, welcome a Greater Bangladesh here.
Yours Truly

0 0 When doctors, teachers, technologists, scientists ...all have a code of conduct for their professional behavior and practices, to be followed  either by choice or by force,  why have we ceased to expect the same of of our elected representatives? When the PM and his team (let go party affiliations)   are working hard to push India forward  with refreshingly new reforms, why doesn't the political class put the country first above all other things? Time for a strict code of conduct in  Parliament?

0 1 Dear Sir,
My suggestion is to share your vision to make India a super power by 2020 or 2025 which will inspire entire people of the country to work towards this mission.

1 0 Sir, organ donation is 0.34% per a million people in India, i.e. about 1 person per 30 lakh people. It's sad that thousands die every day waiting for organs. Please mention about "organ donation" in your Independence Day speech so that more and more people will be inspired to donate their organs after death. This should also become a popular campaign like the ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.’ Also, make sure that the poor should benefit the most because now this sector is mainly under private hospitals.

     I am from kerala . many people are victims of cancer and thyroid diseases. These are due to improper use of pesticides  .steps may taken from govt side to test the vegetables curry leaves ,fruits ,grains and pulses before reaching consumers.If harmful amount of pesticides are found in any consumable item it should be banned and licence of dealer cancelled. labs for testing food items for pesticides artificial colours and flavour must be set up to prevent cancer deaths.

0 0 Dear sir
I wish you could include topics such as majority suppression currently prevailing in India.Since India is a democratic and secular country, there is no logic in sorting on basis of religion and caste for various govt sectors for education and employment. I find this sort of laws and actions as an act against the true idea of the word secularism and is a dishonor  for those who possess the real right. I support the idea of uniform civil code and request you to speak on it

1 0 I wish you all a Happy Independence day in advance. I would like Mr. Modi (our respected PM) to add some word's to his speech on Independence day. Please request our Indian brothers not to address anyone as Muslim, Hindu, Christian or any other religion even at their own mind, consider everyone as their brothers and sisters and address everyone with a smile on your face which is not at all difficult to anyone. It is more easy and valuable to make a peaceful nation rather than a super developed.

Dear Sir, 
The River flowing in and around Kalyan west, from Gandhari Village to Durgadi Fort, if properly cleansed and the surroundings are cleaned & revamped, it will not only save environment, but will also give new lease of life to Flora & Fauna of River, and may also create tourism opportunities, and resultant creations of jobs for the needy.
The thorough cleansing of river , may help in supply of clean potable water, fishing opportunities, etc.

0 0 Differentiating others taking ourselves as the correct version of human race.We should teach them that all are different. The cultures, the habits, the upbringing. We must respect these differences.Because I feel somewhere this creates a thought that others are wrong. This only shapes all differentiations later on as the child grows.A small change in our daily discussions will go a lot more in making our next generation more adaptable and acceptable of differences.

0 0 This one is to urge all parents esp mothers.An educated mother, staying in an urban area, we must understand how much influence our daily discussions have on our children's upbringing.If we stop one thing at home we can bring a big change.Stop discussions like"all punjabis are like this, all haryanvis are like that. all bengalis have this habit.he talks like typical backward caste.etc" This list is endless.If we stop making such judgemental comments, we stop shaping our child's mind negatively.

0 0 Can we have a law where all religious organizations must sell their wealth to India Govt. after a certain limit less than the market price.  Eg:  Thirupati/Padmanabha Swami Temples selling gold to GOVT. less than the current market place which boosts our country's reserves (I am a die hard HINDU)

Dear Sir, 
In India, there is lack of the Palliative Care for the Critically & terminally ill,  Our National Policy document on this susbject of 2012, itself says, that out of total approx. 950 Palliative care Units, approx 800 or so units are based in Kerala.  This shows that in Rest of the India, such patients are not getting the proper care and attention.  The Comprehensive Policy & Implementation in this regard is desirable. 
Yours Truly

2 0 Sir, in your I’day speech, please speak to abolish reservation in education and service. It is not required now as many undeserving people get undue benefit. The standard of education and service goes down. If you want India developed, look at other developed countries. Please give financial support to all socially and educationally backward students who really need help, not blindly to a certain community. Candidates should be considered on merit, not on caste. Give special support to girls.

0 0 The King is the best example for the public, Hence I like to see the Ministers and MPs are giving away their free allowances, subsidies and perks and pay what ever they uses as the general public is paying without any discount and delay. And If minister and MPs does not accept this idea, they are free to leave the post as there are plenty good persons who are ready to take the same on the terms I mentioned.

2 0 Respected sir,
Independence Day is very important for army men as well as people sir on this ocassion please give them the happiness by clearing the issue of "ONE RANK ONE PENSION". This issue is pending since last so many years. Thank you

0 0 Sir
In Present World Following 3 Types of People are found in Each Religion & Country
1 Fundamentalist & Extremist -5%
2 Conservatives & Orthodox -15%
3 Liberals -80%
Research on Lifestyle ,Prosperity, Opportunities ,Growth , Happiness etc..of all above 3 should be Done by World Research Bodies / NGO/ UNO.
Statistics of above all will bring huge Awareness of which " Way of Living" is Best and Natural Way of Living and also in each religion it is heavily emphasised upon.

0 0 For e.g., if a person is aware of any such vital information to share with the govt., he should have a platform to securely inform it to the govt. and there should be dedicated govt. team to enquire it and stop the threat. Same time, for correct information, the govt. needs to reward the messenger heavily based on the importance and critical level of that threat. Soon there will be many messengers start using the platform and would in turn reduce the anti-govt activities

0 0 I personally feel that the people of our country can help the government for pro-actively identify and stop these threats in a better way if we try to collect the details ahead of time, identify the seriousness and act swiftly. I think in some cases, the individuals can help inform these activities to the Govt. if the government is ready to listen, act and reward.

0 0 The activities could be anything - for example bribing, smuggling, illegal deals, terrorism, robbery etc. 
Impact of each of these activities is different. Some times this could go as worst as many of our citizens would lose their valuable life or getting wounded badly, destroy the places and infrastructure, create panic to the whole world, expense to investigate, destroy the growth of our country, threat to economy, investors would not prefer to come to our country etc.

0 0 My idea is related to the importance of improving the security level inside our country. We need to have best systems and processes to protect the life of our people and showcase the value that we give to our citizens. 
Today we know that there are multiple anti-government activities are happening inside our country and it is sad that many times we will come to know only after they destroy something drastically or we might not even aware such thing happened.

0 0 Sir,
1. Please do something to bring up the poor people to a higher level.
2. Please do something to avoid farmer's suicide. They are feeding India including the rich.       if they are screwed everyone will be screwed shortly.

0 0 Please issue an amendment that Article 30 of the Indian constitution shall *explicitly* apply to all religious communities, and not just minorities.  Religious freedom requires that every religious group be allowed to create and manage its religious establishments, subject to public order and laws.  Grant equal rights to all religious communities, independent of their share in the total population.  Namaste.

As you know in most  of the schools, young girls are being raped. To avoid this we should have schools separately for girls and boys. Girls schools should be managed by all women including Principal, Teachers, staff etc vice-versa for boys. This is not an easy task. But we need to do something on this.

0 0 Sir,
1. We were getting petrol @ Rs. 80 when international price for crud oil was $ 140. Now the international price of crud oil is @ $55 or less. Why can't we give that benefit to people instead of increasing the tax?
2. Can we expect to get the black money in the foreign bank accounts as you promised before election?
3. The order from supreme court is "AADHAR CAN MAKE MANDATORY FOR GAS SUBSIDY & NOT FOR ANYTHING ELSE".Now for the provident fund (PF) accounts it is making mandatory. Why?

0 0 Swasth, Swach, Sushikshit, Sasyashyamal, S(w)adeshi, Surakshit Bharat should be our Goal. 
Swasth- Healthcare (have one Govt. funded EXCELLENT hospital per district) - NOT STARTED

Daily I see lord Ganesha's Idols, which are under the some stages of their make up for the upcoming festive season. So, Please speak atleast few words about the celebrations with Gnesha Idols which are not colored with harmful and fancy colors. All these chemicals causes long term water pollution. Instead of buying these fancy Idols people can buy idols which are not painted.

आज देश मे प्रदूषण का स्तर बहुत तेज़ी से बढ़ रहा है। आम आदमी का खुली हवा मे सांस लेना मुश्किल हो गया है। छोटे छोटे बच्चे श्वांस संबंधी बीमारियों से ग्रसित हो रहे है जिससे देश का भविष्य अंधेरे की तरफ बढ़ रहा है।
देश मे बढ़ते प्रदूषण के स्तर को देखकर पर्यावरण के प्रति चिंता होना लजिमी है। आपसे मेरा नम्र निवेदन यह है की कृपया हर राज्य मे CNG से चलने वाले वाहनों के उपयोग पर बल देते हुए ठोस कदम उठाएं तथा स्वच्छ भारत अभियान के तहत वृक्षारोपण को इसमे शामिल करें।

0 0 Less than 1% of Indian youths are studying in IITs/NITS. IITS/NITS cannot provide education to all students. 'The best brains of the nation may be found on the last benches of the classroom. Govt should give more concentration on the education of students staying in our villages and remote  areas of the country. Govt can start State institute of Technology in each and every district to provide better education to all students. Proper funding should be given to all govt institutes not IITS.

0 0 I have my suggestion for GDP growth, environment improvement and education reforms.  Added that as a pdf document.

I feel this can make a huge change in india.

Thank you for such a great initiative of crowd sourcing. My suggestion would be 1) When we talk about development we also need to take some action on how to protect our environment. 2) In Kozhikode Kerala, an initiative called Operation Sulaimani was started providing free food for most deserved. Can we start a pilot phase in some selected districts 3) Some measures on decreasing the increasing trend of road accidents.

1 0 Dear dear Modi Ji, I'm a huge fan of yours.
My suggestion is to change the name of Independence Day to something like National Day may be? Because, the word independence comes out of dependence. Mother India and her children were never dependent on anyone that we are now independent. On the contrary, the foreign invaders were the ones who were dependent, and now independent of India. You see what I'm saying...?
I shall write to you whenever I think I have a good idea.
Thanks and regards,

These department should be helpful to the people and help to do a trustful and a truthful way. If possible please include a suggestion how these departments can be helpful for the people.

2 0 सरकारी नौकरियों में जाति आधारित मौजूदा आरक्षण प्रणाली विभिन्न जातियों के बीच मतभेद निर्मित कर रही है. आरक्षण की व्‍यवस्‍था ऐसी हो जिसमें भारतीय समाज का integration और अखंडता सुनिश्चित हो. अत: इसका लाभ ऐसे अभ्यिर्थियों को मिले जो अर्न्‍तजातीय विवाह करते हों. सरकारी नौकरियों में आरक्षण में वहां प्रोत्‍साहन दिया जाना चाहिये जहां एक ऊंची जाति वाले ने निम्‍न वर्ग में विवाह किया है. आरक्षण की इस प्रणाली से राष्ट्रीय अखंडता को बढ़ावा मिलेगा व भारत में जाति व्यवस्था का क्रमिक उन्मूलन सुनिश्चित होगा.

Ho'ble PM,
There is an important aspect that we should emphasize on. Punctuality. People must respect others' time. For example, if a parliamentary session of 200 members is scheduled to be held at 10 am and 1 member comes at 10:01 am, then we lose 200 mins, i.e 3 hrs and 20 mins. OMG!! So my view is like ''Clean India'', We should have a vision for a ''PUNCTUAL INDIA''.I'm sure, this move will boost our respect globally and contribute towards economic development.

दुनिया मे सबसे जादा धूम्रपान और मद्यप्राशन करनेवाले युवाओं की संख्या हमारे देश मे तेजी से बढ़ रही है। दूसरी बात हमारे देश मे आज भी दहेज लिया और दिया जाता है जब की ये दोनो बाते गैरकानूनी है। तीसरी बात हमारे देश मे भ्रष्टाचार गंभीर समस्या बन गयी है। मुझे लगता है अगर कोई भ्रष्टाचार करता है तो उसकी बीवी और बच्चों ने उससे सवाल करना चाहिए की ये गलत काम आप क्यों कर रहे हो।जय हिंद।

1 0 Sir,it is indeed a painful paradox that the people who feed this nation are themselves left with no food.So,this is indeed the right time for the clarion call to the youth of the nation.."GAO CHALO, KISAN SE MILO".thank you for this brilliant and unprecedented oppurtunity given to the people of this nation by the honourable Prime Minister.Sir,you indeed lead by example.

0 0 Sir, in continuation...since the government is already formulating an agriculture insurance policy, a NATIONAL AGRICULTURE DAY may also be declared apart from the KISAN DIVS being celebrated in december.On this day the intelligentia can contribute novel techniques in the kisan channel and urban population can be encouraged to spend time with their rural counterparts the farmers themselves.This would indeed bring about a sea change in peoples attitudes toward farmers.

0 0 Since its beginning, Indian Railways has been distributing human toilet waste through its trains all over the country at the expense of Bharat Sarkaar. Being the biggest railway network, it can contribute a lot for Our Country's Swaccha Bhaarat Abhiyaan by providing Green toilets in its trains immediately. No other PMs have the courage to implement this. Please compare with the other railway networks of the world when you visit developed/developing countries.

0 0 Dear Sir,my humble suggestion is for you to galvanise the nation with the slogan 'GAO CHALO,KISAN SE MILO'.This will create an awareness in the urban population regarding the dire straits of the farmers.Field trips can be organised for school children to visit farmers in their fields on KISAN DIVAS for them to get a first hand view of farming and its problems.This will cultivate in them a scientific temper for future research in agriclture.

                There are a few things which only a strong Priminister can only do in our country, one of those is addressing the reservation issue. I think now is the time for replacing the cast based reservation with income based reservation.it's a controversial issue but an important one for our country's progress.
                The selection process of the civil services also should involve psychology based and physical test like we have in ssb for the armed forces.

0 0 only thing which could change every thing in this country is EDUCATION we are having 75% literacy rate but number of educated are very few in numbers,only an EDUCATED SOCIETY can reap the fruits of DEMOCRACY a well civilized educated and rational society,the day we will achieve this goal no any other goal will be tough enough to achieve.... so i would like mr PM to take this issue and integrate EDUCATION in all his polices,so that those policies could be implemented rationally.

0 0 सर, बहुत दिनों से एक बात मन में आती है कि जो ये लोग फूटपाथ पर रहते हैं इनके लिए कुछ होना चाहिये। जब दिल्ली जैसे शहर में भी इन बेचारों को देखता हूँ तो लगता है कि हमारा देश अभी भी गरीब है। एवं अंतर्राष्ट्रीय स्तर पर भी देश की छवि ख़राब होती है। इन लोगों को भी एक अच्छी जिंदगी जीने का हक़ मिलना चाहिए। केंद्र एवं राज्यों की सरकारें मिलकर इनके रेहबलिटेशन के लिए कार्यक्रम चला सकती हैं। मुझे लगता है सर इस बार 15 अगस्त पर आप इनके लिए कुछ करें। सादर प्रणाम।

Could not give this anywhere else in mygov!Thanks

Make this Independence Day more special with independenting people from reservation (i.e., from Education, Govt.Job Recruitment etc). As our MAHATMA GANDHIJI make independent india in 1947, you make indian people independent in 2015.
As you and all indians want the development of this country, take one step in our reservation scheme. Make all people equal and then see the real Growth of INDIA.
We hope that you will think about it.

1 0 Please bring this reservation issues and I don't think anybody with Brain should oppose it. If Ambedkar sir was still alive he would have done this change decades ago and India would have been most developed and desired country. Low caste people can't afford, yes we can understand, let us support financially if they deserve and not by giving easy seats and reservations in everything. I am not opposing any caste, their are beggars even in the so called high caste group.

0 0 My suggestion is inorder to increase the economic,
(1) Encourage everybody to buy Indian products.
(2)Similalry the product should be quality product even a simple product. We should not compromise on quality. That will save energy and money.
Thus we can avoid buying foriegn goods more. Because quality as major factor we are buying other countries products. Why we cannot create quality products and we will give value to Rs.

On 15th August can 1 minute line that "Every Indian should respect all Language Speaking People" and Hindi is India's National Language ,so all Highly Educated and Elite Class People should Respect -Non English People too.

1 English or Non English
2 Hindi or Non Hindi
Above Inferior Complexity-Creating Mentality and Attitude among English Knowing People is Hurting Feelings

People with brain & merits should be encouraged and promoted. No reservations for caste, equal opportunity gender based is acceptable but if any group can't meet the eligibility, talent can be swapped. Financial assistance can be given to lower/upper caste based on their needs and eligibility. This is the reason we are still a developing country & non of our universities are top-listed.

0 0 Nowadays when the budget of families is under financial pressure,people want to get quality of life, hence they want to grow. We are a country full of aspirations. But what stops us from the childhood is the high fees which we have to bear, if we want to grow better. From pvt schools,to pvt colleges to pvt postgraduate colleges. We still manage on school level or college level. But when we have to choose post graduation colleges, the fees goes straight up to many lakhs. How can a family who has taken car on loan,has married her daughter by taking loan,has got its scooter on EMI gonna manage a hit of more than 15k a month which goes as interest to banks for the educational loan as the interest rates are so high. They are simply doing business. Not just this much pressure is on the families these days, that they are compromising education standards for lesser fees. I feel very bad about it, but what can we do other than killing our dreams and going for a sub standard college with less fee. Other than that the student has to pay the EMI of more than 15K for the next 10-12 years,compromising everything due to it. This is the case of a huge percentage of India's neo middle class who wants to grow more and more. I could personally tell you my state, my family is paying 2-3 EMIs of my sisters marriage,1EMI for car and some EMIs for insurance. My family daily worries that how will they manage when I'll get into some MBA college in this year's end. We never expected from previous governments, but we do know for what ideals this new government stands and we salute that. I recently got to know about Delhi governments initiative on educational loans I was very happy to hear about it. I would have been more happy if I would have heard such thing from Central Govt of Mr.Modi. But still I believe that you would stand for the cause of students and families. Please sir bring an educational loan scheme so that we could fulfill our aspirations in return benefiting our motherland. Please sir help us, the educational loan percentage is very high and even the fees of Pvt good MBA colleges.

As a step in making India independent in all aspects I want you to talk about the education system in our country.There is a vast increase in the number of educational institutions in our country,but the number of students who understands the purpose and value of education is really less. education is for enabling each and every person to think and act right. So kindly urge our youths to understand what education is & ask them to be a social being with concerns & dreams for the nation.

Instead of setting new institutions, old NIT should be recognised as IIT.We in India are facing a lack of good teachers.An independent commission can be set up to train the teachers.

0 0 kya sach me Indians Aazaad hein?? before independence Indians were tortured by the bloody britishers but now indians get tortured everywhere and every moment by indians.public srvnts not doing their duties perfectly but still getting high salary which is the money of people who still fighting for their rights and officers still taking bribes directly and indirectly.All public works meant for root people have estimated to benefit officers, contractors.now people tortured byour own indian police.

0 0 Honorable PM Ji,
             We are expecting the industrial job opportunities related announcement in the highly proud moment of the 68th Independence day. The defense vehicles,Helicopters,Airplanes and related spare parts may be manufactured in India under "Make In India" scheme in coming years.

0 0 Whenever the congress spokespersons pass a negative comment on your party do not allow your spokesperson to stoop to their level by pointing out their mistakes. There is no point in doing that. The Congress was rejected by the people only because they all did it wrong and so no point in pointing out their mistakes, which are already well known to the people.
In case you have gone wrong somewhere & if others point it out agree and be magnanimous and say the mistakes would be corrected.

0 0 Honourable PM Sir,
 Can we declare next one year as a value system year, where leading figures in Public will strive to create right impressions in the minds of people / their followers.
In general as children follow their parents , followers imitate their leaders.
 people follow what leaders Do and not what they Preach.Can we set an example to Young Generation by being less selfish, more accommodative. Please advice people to have "After You" feeling in all their communications/actions.

0 0 Respected I would like to give my heartiest congratulation on naga peace process.look east policy should be your main agenda for this Independence day. it will boost the trust between mainland india and eastern part of our country.development of the region will bring  more prosperity to region.it will also  led the other insurgent groups to lay down there arms and join the mainstrem of society.so that we can focus more on kashmir and othe fronts of the na tion where we have to counter pakistan.

0 0 Dear PM Modi Sir,
Be rest assured the people and I even now think you are the best person in the country to occupy the Chair of Prime Minister of India.
Having said that, I would like you to be not afraid of anything or anybody, be it RSS or Vasundhara Raje or Sushma Swaraj or Arun Jaitley or Shivraj Singh of Vyapam scam.
People of India had and even have a hope only in you. If you disappoint them by being "SILENT' on many issues plaguing the image of BJP you will be responsible for it.

Midday mill,Aanganbari,etc so I request u plz try to make such bill which will close all these yojna and make a powerful bill in which some seats are reserve in private college for poor children who goes to aanganbari.

1.	Whether Independence means , not allowing parliament to function.
2.	Observing respective religion procession and putting people to discomfort as happened during Kanwar Yatra
3.	Staging protest march to Parliament  with unruly mob.
4.	Character assassination to gain political mileage as done by Congress general secretary Gurudas Kamat
5.	Media can show any news without caring for its consequences as in case of Yakub Menon.

0 0 Respected Sir, I would like to suggest you that we should think about the children of down trodden class who are enrolled for primary education but many of them never complete their primary education. such children join the school ,but gradually, they  become irregular ;only attend school  for scholarship ; slow learners and  feel inferior than others. As we know education is the only way to defeat poverty.Need to focus on primary Education for children of poverty stricken people. Thank You!

0 0 First of all I would like to give thanks for the same. This is our 69th Indian Independence day  which would be celebrate on 15th August 2015.

For this some special things/announcement to be launched/broadcast on this day which are directly or indirectly beneficial to the citizen or the nation.

The idea of swatch bharat was really appriciable. But the major drawback in implemenattion of same in all cities is lack of dustbins by the muncipalities/local governance. When people use any item including fooding may be in town or roads there is no place to dump the garbage. An iniciative in the same shall help in creating swatch bharat.

0 0 Health Departments must change its Attitudes for promoting  various Effective Therapies.

0 0 Sir, Please sensitize people in two subjects. First no-silence on any type of crimes. There must be a special number where everybody can report of crimes happening or to happen. Even one can post some proofs. The identity must be protected. Second is asking distressed farmers to call a number before taking extreme steps. The district administration must ensure such things do not happen.

0 0 Manniy Shri Narendrabhai, kindly speak on awareness regarding quality of education among students. Yen ken prakaren....to receive degree is causing a big chaos....e.g. medical professionals have degree but do not to know how to diagnose disease and treat the patient.

0 0 Respected Sir,
The following burning issue may be highlighted.
Steps needs to be taken for control of population growth in our country with the various schemes for people having only one or two children.
To move country in fast track, control population growth is essentially required.

0 0 Government Health Authorities must review the Adverse Effects of Treatment and find out the reasons for the increasing number of Patients & New Diseases, and if necessary change in the Health Policy to provide proper Health to every Indian at reasonable cost.

0 0 On the occasion of Independence day The PM of our nation must have speech on Poverty in India.
The BPL (below poverty line) ratio increasingly day by day

0 0 PM MODI TO SAY EVERY INDIAN SHOULD KEEP INDIAN FLAG IN THEIR WORK PLACE ,HOME ,OFFICE, WHICH ARE MADE BY PRIMARY SCHOOL STUDENTS AND WILL BE THE FIRST STEP OF MAKE IN INDIA AND MONEY MADE BY SELLING FLAGS WILL BE USED FOR ALL INDIAN PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN DEVELOPMENT COST OF ONE FLAG WILL BE 2 RS. THANKYOU

0 0 Modi Sir,
Congratulations for independence day! i would like to share my idea to give some focus on the cities traffic and cost control. Everyday we say there is a huge chunk of new cars on the city roads hence the idea is to start a campaign to ask people to buy pre owned cars. This will benefit the overall economics by 1) non relevant cost of new car cost reduced for the purchaser 2) control on people tendency to keep buying new cars(reduce some traffic) 3)saving on fresh production car cost

0 0 Hon'able PM of India I would like to suggest my views on the issue of day by day increasing Unemployment in our country. This has become a crucial issue now a days. Many of us don't get any job because of lack of factor such as poverty, costly education , infrastructure, faculty , increasing population etc.

0 0 Self Reliant therapies are Original System of Health. It is wrong to consider them as an Alternative as suggested by Modern Health Science. Please review the Health Policy and Promote Effective Therapies because Health should be the top priority of any Government.

0 0 Honourable Prime Minister
Namaste!
On the forth coming Independence day of Bhaarat Bhoomi, I hereby suggest the following 2 things to be mentioned in Your Honour's speech -
1] The present Govt will do everything in its capacity to retain the Culture and Traditions of our country
2] The present Govt, in the forth coming years, aims to make India - A great business hub, great service hub, great Agriculture hub, great Education hub and a great Defence Hub.

0 0 Dear Sir,
Problem:Insufficient equipment’s or technology in our Defense-I feel really shame when other countries muscle up to fear us with their advanced equipment’s in their defense line up. Solution:I humbly request you to introduce the Volunteer National Security Tax with minimum 0.5%/1% contribution from the citizen’s salary pm on this Independence Day. How:VNST should be deducted along with EPF so that we can make sure that we aren’t wasting this funds on staffing or managing. Jai hind!

1 0 Dear Prime Ministerji,
Independance should be some group action , like we have done for the YOGA days and not a usual speech with full of Ideas

0 0 1. On Birthday He or She should adopt a Tree Plantation near house, Gram Panchayat, Municipal Council.
2. Adopt Community Marriage (Samuhik Sameelan) this will not only reduce expenditure in Marriages but also the drift between Rich and Poor.
3. Adopt everyday for some noble cause like help old age citizen, physically disabled to cross road, remove stones from path to avoid accident, Education to poor children and even a day spent with Ill in Hospital.

0 0 Government must clarify clearly the parameters of Good Health, Correct Diagnosis, Effective Permanent Treatment without Adverse Effect, so that various Effective Therapies can be compared on those parameters. Modern Health Science Experts should not be permitted to comments on any therapy for which they have got no knowledge.

0 0 Whether it is possible to have same Parameters of two Similar Patients. So How medicines manufactured in the factory can be considered as reliable, having no side Effects. Therefore Government must promote Self Reliant Drugless Therapies which are more Effective & Reliable and are having no side effects. Necessary amendment in Health Policy is the need of the time.

0 0 Contd:Clarify the dubious people of India on the importance of bills like GST and Labour Reforms which are meant for Economic Reforms-II(as it happened in Economic Reforms-I in 1990s). Some more issues include Corruption, Food Safety, International Relations for economic boost, policies meant for enhancing economy to an export based one, Safety of Women, Development plans of North-east, Land Bill,Farmer Suicides, Special Status to the undeveloped states. These are my views to be included.

0 0 I suggest to pay heed on wide range of issues. To start with, terrorism in the wake of current attacks on the Indian soil and along the LOC and International Border. Reiterate the stance on flagship schemes such as Swachh Bharath, Digital India, FDIs, New policy on Education, strengthening of providing basic Healthcare and infrastructure so as to achieve UN's Sustainable Development Goals 2030 (Caution: We failed to reach Millennium Development Goals-2015 in some aspects such as IMR,MMR etc.)

0 0 Suggestions on 15 August 2015 for the announcement from Lal Qila (Red Fort) Delhi.
1.	Announcement from Red Fort, New Delhi about soldiers of Indian Army.
2.	Announcement from your side to appreciate the Army Officers, JCOs and Jawans include Para Military Force.
3.	One rank one pension for Army.
4.	Announcement of the 7th pay commission
5.	Double pay of the soldiers of Indian Army in 7th pay commission.

0 0 Thank You Modiji for giving this wonderful opportunity.
What I'm thinking is Like Swatch Bharath, You please kick-start a mission-"GREEN BHARATH"
Making Green our nation requires utmost importance. You can inspire the Youth.
Also pls speak about Educated India as Skill India

0 0 PASS GST BILL IN THIS SESSION AS ITS DELAY WILL HURT EACH OF 127 CRORE INDIANS : TWO PERSONS RAHUL AND SONIA, CANNOT HOLD COUNTRY TO RANSOM. PARTY REJECTED BY PEOPLE SHOULD WAIT FOR 2019 ELECTIONS. LIKE SUSPENSION OF 25 CONGRESS MP OF LOK SABHA, ASK CHAIRMAN TO SUSPEND ALL 68 CONGRESS MP OF RAJYA SABHA AND GET IT PASSED BY REMAINING. MISSING DATELINE OF APRIL 2016 WILL HURT ECONOMY AND BJP PROSPECTS IN FUTURE ELECTIONS. CONGRESS IS ONLY INTERESTED IN DIVIDE AND RULE AND NOT IN GST REFORMS

0 0 Government should not Blindly follow the Modern Health Science and Review the Adverse effects of Vaccinations also from the Scientific reports available all over the world.

0 0 Hello Sir,
 More then 500000 people die every year waiting for organ donors in INDIA.As 13 AUGUST is called organ donation day.So from your  medium i want to tell all the people of INDIA to donate one organ or whole body after death so we can save someone life .I'm 20 yrs old and today i have taken pledge to donate my organ. As a youth of INDIA i'm thinking like this so plzzzz kindly get aware of this ..

0 0 'Mata,Pita,Guru daivam.'I would like the PM of my country to talk about 'Guru'.In many schemes such as 'Padhe bharat, Bade bharat';'Beti bachao beti padao' there is stress on child and education but what about him/her who bestows the education to children?.Guru(Teacher) is the one who can attribute knowledge to lead one s life independently.Why are we not seeking to to create a platform(job providing scheme) to increase the strength of Teachers in the country? Lets think of "Intelligent" INDIA.

0 0 Government must adopted Holistic Approach in Health and Review the Reliability of Present Diagnosis system which is considered to be most Scientific and Correct.

0 0 Dear Prime Minister,
Thank you for the opportunity. I sincerely believe the updates on the existing initiatives and known issues would be addressed. To add to it, my expectation would be to hear you address the nation in bringing a harmony and discipline among the citizens through the righteousness in the individual minds, as Dr. Kalam said. The root cause for many problems that we face today is selfishness driven indiscipline and not live the way our forefathers taught us for centuries.

0 0 Dear PM sir,
I would like to hear from you, on this independence day about:
1. Made in India.
2. initiatives to maintain and increase the quality of education and research in India
3. Progress made so far in swachha bharat abhiyan
4. imposing some screening methods on media news coverage, as we know, we need to respect freedom of media, but the media which dedicate 18 hours in a day for discussion of hanging of terrorist, punished by court of law, surely needs some rules to guide

0 0 Why is India not working faster towards robotics? Our country is focusing on skill development. We should consider robotics for not just automation of production processes but also to help people when they are not too productive in later years of life. Budget allocation towards automation in industries should be encouraged. Cities enabled with technology/robotics for old people or disabled should be considered in development plan.

1 0 Dear Modi Jee, Now the time has come to take decision for running parliament by hook or crook, to much of loss just becoz of congress. why not you will take hard steps to arrest lalit modi from uk and take decision all people who have involve in IPL. Kuch toh app ko bhi karna hoga, People are waiting for your speech on 15th aug so do as per public expectation otherwise people will also forget you.we love you and know you are honest but any circumtance ,u have to manage the situation.Thanks

0 0 Government must review Health Policy on top priority to incorporate all Effective systems of Treatment. In modern Health Science Mental & Spiritual cause of Diseases are almost ignored so such Diagnosis can not be considered as Reliable and So Treatment is also not Permanent.

0 0 Respected Sir
We have to set a target of ZERO PLASTICS TO LAND FILL BY 2022 in the country in Swacha bharat abhiyan
•	Plastic waste collected from house hold should not be allowed to be taken to the landfill. Instead it should be recycled or taken to the Plastic waste processing plants.•	Plastic waste collection centers to be set up separately in every dumping yard across the district.
•Energy recovery oriented Plastic waste to fuel/gas/power Plants to be encouraged in every district..

0 0 Dear Sir, WE feeling embarrssing that you are not taking hard steps against congress mainly rahul and his family, take immediate action on robert vadera and open all illegal purchase of land in haryana then you see the result.How u r facing problem for passing GST in Parliament and how they creating problem.

0 0 Aadhaar enrollment is big scam and looting every citizen in India by contractors and govt employees. For enroll Aadhaar one has to pay Rs 100 to the agency at Rayachoti, Cuddapah district in Andhra Pradesh. Now election commission is linking Aadhaar to Voter id, how can one understand Transparency in Govt policy. Firstly it is done in wrong way, secondly CEO dependent upon Aadhaar status. Now Supreme court has said aadhaar is an option. PM sirjii people are frustrating please do something.

0 0 Sir,
We hold our National Flag at heights with pride. We feel proud when our Flag is held high among the other nations flag during sports and other events. But we forgot the man who designed our National Flag? Even many in our country do not know about the man who designed our National Flag. It is too late, still why dont we honor the man atleast today. I would like the Nation to listen from you a few words about this great man Pingali Venkayya, the designer of our flag, on Independance day.

0 0 Dear PM,
1. Why make in India? Why not made in India?
2. To develop the Infrastructure we are converted Two way road to 4 way road. To do that we are removed so many old trees(500 yr old) because of that our earth is getting worm day by day. To avoid global warming what is our(ind) plan?
3. Why do we request Pepsi and Cock to add fruits in their drinks? Why don't we order them?
4. Where we are to develop organic Foods? Why can't we band non organic band?
balance in next chance, thanks.

0 0 Honble Prime Minister Sir,Namaskar.I want to share my views on conditions rules acts facilities issued by Govt from time to time for the benefit of differently abled children and their parents/caregivers.It is good that Govt and Govt agencies have clear pictures of difficulties encountered by multiple disabled children and their guardian/parents/caregivers but question arises whether these rules,acts,notifications are strictly followed and checked.I feel and experience it is not.....Regards

0 0 Dear PM,I believe this independence day should promote "India in Action" Suggestions: 1. Reforms should start from home. So it would be great if you can get all your colleagues to join "GiveItUp" and present the result to people on this independence day. This will definitely inspire many. 2. myGov.in is my personal favourite initiative. But I always feel lack of interactivity. Atleast daily/weekly responses ensures voices heard. One way, most of the times ends with sustainability problems.

0 0 Sir,
I work for an organisation in field of financial inclusion. We are currently working with Ministry of PNG to replace Kerosene with better alternative fuels. Currently there are some 500,000 deaths because of indoor air pollution caused mainly by cooking on wood or dung cake. If we could replace it with Solar lighting and LPG it will be great service to the country. #PM#IndependenceDay#15thAugust

1 0 Remove caste base reservation. Caste is a thing that never change without rebirth. So the one who born in reserved continuously take benefit of it and the required one does not take benefit of it. Poverty never ask your caste it come. Poverty it is another name of backwardness. At least you should remove OBC because there is no definition of OBC in constitution it is use for votebeank. Quality of our country affected by it. One doctor with 45% and other with 95% not affect on treatment??

0 0 sir, in this independence we would like to hear about national education policy , and their impact, as well you must share ideas to improve city by there locals idea, and things to be covered by govt with aadhar which would not effect privacy but easy system, and for commercial sectors which is being developed in this year by govt , improving indianpost by different ideas, and not free but as in infrastructure low budget high speed wifi internet to be provided in coming next year should be implemented.

0 0 Sir we have so many hopes from yours gov.such as make anti corrupted Indian gov.make our gov for people .also make permanent solution for drought area like Riverjoint Project as early as possible

0 0 In India we work every day for at least 9 to 10 hours and also travel time  place and  which takes about two hours.We spend very limited time with family and friends.In US,Europe, Australia Saturday and Sundays are weekly offs.Similarly if India too practices this , productivity will improve as every one will be energised.Also certain expenses like travel cost, electricity expenses at offices will come down.Health condition will improve as it will destress and give time for sports activities.

0 0 Respected Priminister Sir,
I would like to sahre that the All the elections whether it is Lok Sabha ,Vidhan Sabha,Block level,Pancyat Lavel or any kind of election should be organized same time and fixed month. 
1)This will save lot of Money from Tax payers making election arrangements at a time for all the post.
2)Lot of Time saving because at present due to elections there is lot of works kept pending due to code of conduct .

0 0 Sir,we know that you cannot contact each citizen and solve their problems but there should be some response from your office at least we send you mails,messages share our ideas but we never know whether you have read it or not whether some action will be taken or not.If we send you some of our problem or submit some complain details then we feel we are not getting any positive response we dont even know whether its even read or not.So there should be some way to know that we are being responded

1 0 Sir,cleanliness is maintained by the municipal corporations/nagar parishad in the urban areas.The rural markets in india always face difficulty in the disposal of wastes as there is no apex body to maintain cleanliness  there. Swacchh bharat abhiyan can only be complete when the rural markets (like Chandil, haludpukur,baharagora etc in jharkhand) will look clean.only awareness is not sufficient,govt support is also needed.

0 0 Need Action plan for Corruption government employee. Because Political have to work thought government emp. If government emp will become good. Definitely, Corruption ratio down.
Suggestion
1. Create Mobile Apps, for normal citizen add complain by it. Complain must be solve within 28 days. if not solve , then cut 100 rs from emp of head Department
2. Every year survey property of Government emp, also family. If any emp arrested for Corruption, need immediate action like Suspend and sea

Pl.Bring in law of Tort,this will neutralise all wrong  and negative things happening,by panchayat, Corporation,or states or by person.

1 0 Sir,a fresh data of pollution level in the major rivers of the country/life line of major cities should be made.This data should be provided to the public(like pollution level data for river subarnarekha at jamshedpur,chandil, ghatsila and medinipur) through the different forms of media.Awareness should be created among the lacal mass and effort at the govt level should also be done to control the pollution.The work done by govt should also be provided through local media.

0 0 Sir,
This is the culture mostly used by multi national companies. every year they hold impact day for their employees, where employees are asked to work 1 day for society.

1 0 Sir, after your entry in radio through "mann ki bat", akashvani has become quite popular among the masses.Presently, In india, broadcast is done generally on the primary channel through medium wave but the present generation accesss the radio through mobile phones/audio systems that generally supports FM. On this occassion please convert all the radio tramissions to FM.Radio is more popular in the rural areas so please check the local radio station connectivity in these locations.

I request you to mention those organisations and their karyakartas  (including the karyakartas of the political party which thrives on the contributions of millions of common people to the strruggle but claims it as its own) who have sacrificed their life or made contributions to the freedom struggle of India. This is very necessary as for the last 67 yrs one political party claims as they are the sole organisation which participated in the freedom struggle.

0 0 On Independence Day let's shed gulami ki maansikta ie.corruption. one doesn't steal from one's own house. When British were master we were stealing from British. Now we are our own master and stealing from ourselves.

0 0 Its time to infuse innovation & cherish and nurture culture from every tehesil in India. Policy suggestion:Establish "Innovation,Science & Culture Center" in every Tehesil of India.They will conduct Festivals,Competitions,Knowledge&Exposure visits for Students of Schools and colleges.They will also have a shopping complex,theater,garden,permanent science exhibition.Local governing bodies,NGO's & Businesses will support such projects uder CSR initiatives. Incredible India can also be promoted.

1 0 Honourable Prime Minister,
The major cause of concern for the nation,and for world,are:
1) Climate Change
2) Terrorism
3)Economic disparity
Albeit all of them are equally important but terrorism among them is a multifaceted concern with varied connotation. Terrorism, is actually extremist behaviour,deeds by extremist.The major cause or say tools to curtail it, lies within it:
1)Education
2)Extremism, in every kind
3)Tyranny, or hegemony by majority or superpower. Need PEMS approach.

0 0 Respected Prime Minister...An announcement followed by a discision to have the photographs on the currency of our nation...of Shaheed Bhagat Singh,Lal bahadur Shastri,Vallabhai Patel and so many relevant freedom fighters and great people who have build this great nation.This will go a long way in influencing and creating awareness among the youth of today....to value,cherish and keep working for this freedom and to build a stronger nation.

0 0 Sir Why Many of Central Govt Policies and Schemes are not getting success or difficult to implement is because of following reasons
1 All Model Fits One Policy is 100% Wrong

0 0 Sir, 
While everyone agrees that, Independence Day is a day to look behind & pay our respects to countless martyrs whose efforts have ensured freedom to us, it's also a day to LOOK AHEAD, to chart the path, INDIA HAS TO MOVE ON IN THE DAYS TO COME....& in this regard, we need to focus on PRIMARY EDUCATION by digitally empowering all schools with Digital India Schemes. LET'S BEGIN WITH EMPOWERING OUR TEACHERS FIRST - LET'S TRAIN OUR TEACHERS & ALSO EMPOWER THEM WITH DIGITAL INDIA TOOLS.

There is no pension scheme for those employee and it is very difficult  to get the another in private sector after attaining the age of 50 years.

Private company should retrain and get suitable employment for such employees.

My name is Pragya Iyengar and I am 7 years old. I feel very sad for people in poverty and I would really like them to have food every day. It is very hard to see them suffer while I have a very comfortable life.  Though I don't know how to address this, it will be good if the hotels can donate the excess food for the poor. I would like you to address the issue of poverty and hunger and use your influence to ask hotels and restaurants to donate excess food.  Thank you

A fix-it-first strategy can serve as an integral part of a

strategy prioritizes infrastructure spending to support

and facilities instead of incurring the cost of constructing
or installing new infrastructure. Fix-it-first approaches
generally are used in funding transportation infrastructure
(e.g., roads, bridges, and rail systems)

 मुझे पूरा भरोसा है की महिला शक्तिकरण पर जो भी करंगे वो वो शत प्रतिशत होगा।
मेरा छोटा सुझाव है की यदि महिला शसक्तीकरण करना है तो जंहा हर जगह सरकार ने दो से ज्यादा संतान पर किसी दंपति को राजनीती या किसी अन्य कार्य में लाभ से रोका है वंहा आप यदि दो से ज्यादा कन्या संतान होने पर दंपति के सभी लाभ जारी रखेंगे तो आने वाले समय में न सिर्फ कन्या भ्रूण हत्या रुकेगी वरन ज्यादा कन्या रेशियो भी बढ़ेगा और ये  महिला शसक्तीकरण में एक मिल का पत्थर साबित होगा। ऐसा मुझे विश्वास है।

0 0 शिक्षा का अधिकार का कड़ाई से पालन नही हो पाया है जिससे अनेको गरीबों के बच्चे अभी भी तथाकथित पब्लिक स्कूलों में दाखिला लेने के लिये तरस रहे हैं. शिक्षा का स्तर सुधारने के लिये निगरानी तंत्र को मजबूत करने की जरूरत है. यदि किसी स्कूल में निर्धारित मानदंडों के अनुरूप सुविधायें नही है तो उसकी मान्यता रद्द करने जैसी कार्यवाई की जानी चाहिये. सभी स्कूलों में पाठ्य पुस्तकें एक सी ही होनी चाहिये. मधुकर पवार इंदौर

0 0 Respected Sir, while you have taken action to make our bureaucrats more accountable, there is a need to penalise those who delay decision or knowingly take wrong decision due to vested interests resulting in inflated project cost. In such cases, the inflated costs should be recovered from such officers which will ensure that don't indulge in such activities.

0 0 हमारे देश में कोई वाहन नीति बनानी चाहिये . यदि कोई भी व्यक्ति चौपहिया वाहन से घर से बाहर निकले तो उस वाहन में तीन चौथाई लोग होने चाहिये. ऐसा नियम बन जाये तो लोक परिवहन को बढ़ावा मिलेगा जिससे सड़कों पर वाहनों का दबाव कम होगा और दुर्घटनायें भी कम होंगी. वाहन खरीदने वाले को वाहन के पार्किंग की व्यवस्था सुनिश्चित करनी होगी. कोई स्पष्ट नीति नही होने के कारण यात्रियों को सुविधायें नही मिल रही है. निजी परिवहन वाहनों में सीटों की संख्या, सीटों के बीच अंतर, किराया, वाहनों में दो दरवाजे जैसे अनेक मुद्दे हैं

0 0 किसानों को खाद, बीज और दवाई रियायती मूल्य पर उपलब्ध होना चाहिये. इस समय खाद,  बीज और दवाईयों की कीमतें आसमान छू रही है जिसके कारण फसलों की लागत में लगातार इजाफा हो रहा है. कृषि उपज की विशेषकर सब्जियों की कोई निश्चित कीमत नही होने के कारण कभी कभी किसानों को अत्यधिक नुकसान उठाना पड़ता है. इस दिशा में अभी तक कोई कदम नही उठाये गये है. खाद, बीज और दवाईयों की कीमतों पर भी कोई नियंत्रण नही है,

Decreasing ground water levels are a great cause of concern.People need to be serious about this .
While  building  house in life one can make some provision for harvesting rain water wherever possible.

0 0 Ministry of Agriculture needs some changes for the welfare of the farmers. The farming sector is still an un-organised sector. Farmers are working without in this sector without much guidance and moral support. Farmer's suicide has become a matter of serious concern. They feel frustrated, when their crops get damaged either in drought or in rain or heavy flood. They have to take loans from untamed financial borrowers with higher interest rates for investing in their farm lands.

0 0 Sir.  The present backlog of cases can be cleared, with the oldest cases being taken on priority, by giving extension to retired/retiring judges, with the Registrar monitoring their performances and bringing it to Chief Justice notice on monthly basis.  Creating additional courts would be a drain on the exchequer and poor nation like us cannot allow a bloated judicial system.

0 0 In order to achieve effective service delivery of governance, there should be some ministry-level changes in India. Particularly, the Ministry of Home Affairs(MHA) should be dismantled into various other ministries, as the MHA is bestowed upon many crucial tasks .
In view of increasing threats from global terror outfits, India should create a separate Ministry for Terrorism Control and Prevention, freeing MHA from this responsibility.

0 0 Respected PM, kindly have a meeting of all Chief Justices and impress upon them the need to give justice in time.  We do not need more courts, what we need is justice delivered within a reasonable time of say maximum 2 years for a civil case. If cases are decided within this reasonable time, the number of cases being filed would come down as many a time cases are filed, especially where the litigant is aged ones, as they know that no decision would be taken for 10-20 years

0 0 Respected Sir,
Please abolish section 377 IPC, which is being misused by most of the estranged wives these days. I have myself observed in Allahabad High Court that hundreds of cases are piling up with sections 498A/406/377 IPC and Judge is asking petitioners to pay handsome amounts to complainant wife, if they want relief of 'not arrest' from the courts. Hence either abolish 377 IPC or seal world Heritage of Khajuraho Sex Temples, where Oral / Anal sex is prominently display to visitors.

0 0 Dear Sir, want to draw your attention to best initiative of your Gov - #GIVEITUP. Many in this country have an appreciation for sharing/giving. However over the past decade we have grown a lot skeptical about everything/everyone. The culture of trust/ belief in the society is non-existent. Can you speak on this topic of Sharing/Giving and need to bring back the Trust/Belief based social structure. Think this country needs some inspiration Who else to look up to other than Our beloved Mr.#PM

 After coming into chair,u have announced many programs.i think,it does not reach upto bottom.i think,better to ,directly ask to BDO,with the help of MUKHIYA give 1/2 hours demo for each program  in each PANCHAYAT/village .In each block  there is 20-25 panchayat.In each panchayat 4-5 villages .So it  is not difficult  and result-- unbeleavable.

0 0 8-Still British Raj-There are areas where still we feel atmosphere like British Raj.Gap in ranks in Defense which now a days leading to mutiny etc. need to check well in time.Appropriate steps to be taken by Govt.
9-Gallantry awards-That amount need to multiplied as per Price Index.People behind that person need to be taken utmost care.
10-Court need to revise their charges/bond fee according to current scenario and should be revised at regular interval.This will help country financially.

  Where were we standing on the Defense front ( Means how badly the arm forces were
  equipped) & What are the steps taken / planned to overcome this.

  must be shared with every India

0 0 Sir,
   I want highlight one that about farmer,
Though he is producing too much but he getting too less.
  Mean to say, we are observing much more price spread but his share is too less(5%-10%). So, please mandate the rules to control middle man OR make easy marketing channels. So that farmer can get actual profit. Because he is the one who takes up actual production activities.
        Thank you.....

0 0 Respected Sir,
I want you to speak on the topic of media and films, now a days films are being made on baseless topics or otherwise controvercial. Our Indian history is so much huge that if the films would be made on them it would take years and years from the harappan civilisations till modern india to showcase. So why dont these filmmakers show us such historical things inspite of those idiosyncratic films which are of no educational values for us and neither they are entertaining.

2) Women want to hear about there safety, female children of age group 3 to 5 years want to hear about there safety. A capital punishment should be given to a rapist.

0 0 Sir, please try for some strategy that will make do with caste based reservation forever, and make economic backwardness the only criteria for reservation. This will help to stop brain drain to some extent and will also help the lower caste people strive for excellence. Present case is that they are not motivated to excel. Sri. Ambedkar had envisaged a scenario in which caste based reservation is phased out over time. But the percentage of reservation has increased not decreased

This will result in saving indian families, good care of elderly besides easing multiple woos of metro cities on account of overcrowding.

0 0 Sir,I would try to take your attention towards the implementation part of Swacchh Bharat programme as the recent survey showed the still dismal state of cleanliness in various regions.There should be a more innovative way of ensuring proactive and participatory approach of all sections of society towards this issue which time and again becomes down and dusted in theatrics form.

0 0 Agriculture is highly sensitive sector that affacts 65% of population but contributes just 14-15% to the GDP. It has huge disguised unemployment emphasiging the need of only sustainable remedy of shifting this manpower load to other sectors and allied activities like forestry, fishery, poultry, etc. Hence, some concrete program for young farmers be launched. Helping farmers from time to time and offering them with incentives may never be an affective solution in true sense.

Social Security Schemes of PMSBY, PMJJBY & APY are really path breaking. We expect this year Speechins announcement of Mega Rollout of these schemes ensuring that every eligible individual is covered in 1/2 year span with small Government support except for White Ration Card holders in a range of 25-50% of total cost. Coverage of these schemes alone will be Great Achievement in itself for Common Man giving financial freedom making Independence Day meaningful in real sense.

0 0 Dear Prime Minister, India is a wired country but not in a positive sense. We have wires hanging from everywhere in our cities and villages - electricity, cable, telephone, internet and what not! Its time we get rid of the wires and become a clean and wireless India in the real sense!

0 0 Dear Prime Minister, India is making a lot of progress in many areas but we are far behind in a lot of areas. As a lot, we are the most undisciplined - don't care about cleanliness, rules and regulations, respect others, aesthetics etc; We need a decade long Social Change campaign that addresses these issues!

0 0 Pranam! Forming Citizens Clubs in every ward, across the country will prove to be a big leap in democracy.

0 0 Dear Modi Uncle, In your maiden independence day speech, you mentioned about the pride associated with government service. However, injustice is faced due to wide prevalence of reservation for SC/ST/OBCs at selection process itself. As a responsible citizen, I do believe in inclusive growth and justice to vulnerable section of society. But benefits need to reached the intended beneficiaries and not the affluent ones. So can we pronounce "Let's Give it Up" for reservation as we have done for LPG.

0 0 Pranam ! Consulting Public, mostly youth, using internet is the turning point present government gets the credit for !

0 0 Respected Sirji, For the Independence Day we would like to hear you on following topics..
1) Connecting Rivers to each other - It'll help for Water Management. Sometimes it's flooded situation in one area at the same time there is draught condition in other part of Country.
2)Make In India - Imported China goods are cheaper than Indian make market goods. So please give clarity about Make In India so small scale industries of this country can survive.
3)Unemployment-Skill development.

Like google and yahoo..we should also develop our own browser...our IT youths should be given a task to develop exclusive new browser made by India by Indian. by doing so we can bring revolution in IT field.

Neighboring Gulf countries had no great history, but now UAE, Kuwait and Saudi countries have giving their citizens 100% jobs, shelter and Health. Our Indians are going to Gulf for house-maid for their livelihood. Sir this is just because of govt policy. Change policy to give self respect for Indian

0 0 Dear Prime Minister Modi, On this Independence I would you to give a new vision to all Indians with a rallying cry that motivates and gravitates one and all towards a higher order purpose of what India should achieve by 2025. Every government that comes in talks about growth - achieve 7% or 8% growth. A common man on the street or in the rural areas does not understand growth esp in % terms. Some suggestions - India - World's Most Happiest Nation; Regain the lost Glory! Or Whatever suits best!

0 0 R/Sir,
     It is a privilege to be addressing you on your call to the nation for sharing ideas what you wish to take as inputs for the independence day address .
our country has no dearth of problems.
one such problem is the health or medical system.
Most of the times,Govt. hospitals are not efficient or managed suitably to provide Medical attention to needy.
One,such announcement from your end ,for #cashless #Hospitalization costs 4 every Indians could bring hope 4 many Indians.

0 0 Respected Sir, politicians and bureaucrats hog all the limelight at the cost of others.  It is time we felicitate technocrats who have done yeoman service to the nation in their fields.  I would suggest Dr E Sreedharan, Metroman, for Bharat Ratna Award.  Pamban bridge, Konkan Railway and finally Delhi Metro, all are great achievements carried out in record time against all odds.  Such awards should be given when the person is alive and in sound state of mind so that they can really appreciate it

0 0 Respected PM Sir announce regarding health insurance to all citizens

0 0 Namaste Modi Ji,
I have suggestion for my fellow Indians.
Different country has different culture, India is giving service to different countries but loosing our culture by adopting customer culture.
Let's start with small initiative by saying Namaste instead of saying Dear, Hi or Hello.
All companies in India should start using namaste in every email, Letter or any converision.
Small Namaste word give identity for an Indian and India everywhere.

1 0 Dear Sir,
Right to compulsory education in India was passed a few year back but never implemented. We have millions of child labors, child prostitutes, beggar...who are getting exploited and are far from their rights. It will be great if government can ensure its implementation with some accountable people for its implementation.

0 0 R/sir,please announce about the ambitious project of connecting rivers nationwide. It will make the atmosphere very positive all over India.

1 0 Every year we have new population in Corors. Government can not create the new employment for livelihood for all in this case. More people also mean more ecological footprint....We need to take tough steps for the population of India.
Strangely when population was half of current population. It was a big issue but now it is in sideline!

When we celebrated Yoga day few days back, Sense of mental and philosophical independence came on the surface of mind with high dopamine.

But Unfortunately it has created risk to me and many more like me who has to cross the roads everyday.

महिला सुरक्षा से एक और बात कहना चाहता हूँ कि महिला को घर के अंदर & बाहर समान अवसर मिलना चाहिए।दोनों को एक दूसरे के प्रति हिंसात्मक व्यवहार नहीं करना चाहिए। और इस समस्या का समाधान यह भी नहीं है कि महिलायें पुरुषों पर हमला करने लगें। लेकिन यह भी सच है कि पुरुषों द्वारा उनपर किये गए अत्याचारों को वे कबतक बर्दाश्त करें। इसलिए लोगों की मानसिकता बदलने की जरूरत है। यह मानसिकता कैसे बदलेगी?🗻

One area which I think needs systematic attention is the lack of general safety. For example, the roads in our country are virtual death traps. They are not at all pedestrian friendly. I feel so bad when I see children and older people walking along the road or crossing the road. Most cities and town in this country lack proper foot paths. On behalf of the citizens of this country, I request you to launch 'Surakshit Bhaarat' ('Safe India') campaign on Independence Day.

0 0 Dear PM Sir, I would request you to speak about dissuading people from using plastic bags. Today a major portion of our garbage consists of plastic bags which are highly harmful to the environment. People should be encouraged to reuse plastic bags. The environment we are leaving for our next generation should be a good one. This issue of plastic and disposal/reuse is also crucial to the wonderful "Swachch Bharat" campaign initiated by you, PM Sir. So request please talk about this topic/issue.

0 0 Respected Prime Minister Sir,
I would like to continue my conversation from my previous post.
1. Use of JATROPA (Bio-diesel)and cultivation of the same in non agricultural sessions must be encouraged in farmers so that they can make money during lean seasons. because jatropa can be cultivated on any try of land and temperature.
2. Cleanliness must be given top priority.

0 0 To Hon.PM Sri.Narendra Damodardas Modiji,
My humble suggestion is take immediate step to tackle population explosion. I would request Hon.PM Sri.Modiji to introduce new schemes for birth control. Your visions are good, but we can mix colour in pond, but we can't in the SEA.

0 0 On Indian roads we often see roads covered with layer of sand and dust. This sometimes responsible for breathing problem and lung diseases, other than this it is sabotaging government initiative of swachh bharat. So my suggestion is 10 to 20 percent of total road width must be covered with grass. This also give quite good look to our roads. And then Hollywood movies alternative location for Pakistan will no more be India.

0 0 Dear Prime Minister i would like to suggest the following ideas;-
1. maximum two child policy should be strictly followed for our economic growth, distribution of national wealth and our future prosperity.
2. cast reservation system should be abolished, financial condition should be the one and only criteria for getting help of reservation.

0 0 Respected Prime Minister Sir,
I would like to continue my conversation from my previous post:
1. Terrace Farming must be made an "Abhiyaan" so that people learn to cultivate there own food of daily requirement on there terrace only. This will be helping in many ways like 1. Its organic 2. It will help to reduce the inflation rates 3. due to expansion of city, trees are cut down. one can use his terrace for planting. 4. Every person can be a farmer 5. Clean and green oxygen rich environ

1 0 Dear Modiji, Please consider these ideas:
1) Open education centres for the progress of farmers and illiterate women in villages for learning basic knowledge, employment skills, and computer education irrespective of their age and economic background.
2) Try to positively eliminate caste based reservation quotas in a gradually phased manner especially in technical sectors like Medical Science and Indian Engineering Services for high qualified & specialized professionals & for social equality.

0 0 Respected Prime Minister Sir,
I would like to continue my conversation from my previous post:
1. Solar panels must be subsidized & made compulsory so that every household can get and use solar energy easily. Use of solar AC's must be made a mission because electricity consumed in summers will be very high due to requirement of AC's. We just need to convert and utilize the very hot summer temperature to our cooling needs. This will help in balance of humans & nature

0 0 Respected PM, my suggestions are:-
1. Remind the citizens of our country of their constitutional duty to develop a scientific temper. Our fellow citizens should show dissent not outrage if they find somebody's view offensive. Kindly request them to enhance the intellectual legacy of our country by countering ideas with superior ideas and not by bullying or banning.
2. Ask the citizens to wisely use more of their time to work for a glorious future rather than talking more of a glorious part.

1 0 Dear Modiji,
1) Create a powerful International Anti-terrorist Force to effectively fight terrorism by team work of all nations and for world peace.
2) Establish an International Institute of Democracy Studies, for social and political research and revolutionise reforms in World's largest democracy.
3) Provide free healthcare to all children below 3 years in India and subsidised medicine for orphans and handicapped persons.

0 0 Please provide social security to Outsource /contract employee.

1 0 3 Suggestions:
1. PM ने कहा था विद्यार्थी साइंटिस्ट बनने में रूचि नहीं दिखाते. रूचि तब जागृत हो जब विज्ञानं समझ में आये. उसके लिये Practicals बहुत जरूरी हैं. अधिकतर स्कूल, कालेजों में लैब नहीं हैं. हैं तो बन्द रहती हैं.एग्जाम टाइम में हर विद्यार्थी से रुपये इकट्ठा करके external examiner को भेंट कर दिये जाते हैं. बच्चों को मनचाहे नंबर दिला देते हैं. इंजीनियरिंग कालेजेज तक यही हल है. गवर्नमेंट कालेज ही इसका अपवाद हैं. समझने पर जोर कम, रटने पर जादा है .

0 0 Respected Prime Minister Sir,
1. The toilet waste and water will be directly left on tracks and the track over its whole length gets dirty. Trains must be fitted with the technology that is used in Aeroplanes for the use of toilets.
2. There must be more R&D in designs and interiors of train. As how new model of vehicles in automobile industry are launched,  which are energy efficient and comfortable too, then why not in railway? we still use same design and interiors from so many year.

1 0 Sir,on independence day, you can talk about "RIVER JOINING PROGRAMME"
Part of India is suffering from lack of water for agriculture and other side north India is suffering from floods!!!
You can think about it as you have done it in Gujarat in case of Sabarmati and Narmada and other small rivers...
Thank you

0 0 Sir, for the development of the NorthEast India, I suggest a dual time-zone with the new time-zone for this region.This has been a long-standing demand of the people of this region and has been endorsed by eminent scientists of INDIA.Using IST leads to the loss of 2 daylight hours everyday.Sir, you can notice all the more-developed states of GUJRAT and MAHARASHTRA lie on the western side of the IST with almost no daylight loss.This decision if taken will prove 2 be a milestone 4 develpment of NE

1 0 Dear Modiji, i would like to suggest following ideas:
1) Open a World Cultural Centre at New Delhi or Mumbai, giving boost to international tourism which will showcase various cultural ethnicities from different parts of the world, based on concept of Unity in Diversity.
2) Establish a World-class International Open University under Digital India Learning Programme for providing a world-wide open educational resource which can revolutionise and develop socially backward areas of the world.

0 0 giving the importance of agriculture. Since the agriculture depends on monsoon. The poor farmers have to be protected by crop insurance. We ourself insure for the any eventualities. similarly the crop the farmer growing is to be insured. Otherwise the farmers may commit suicide because of debit he borrowed.

0 0 "Self Discipline for public by public"
Sir i would like to get your attention on above topic as we all are aware that now a days the major road problem is traffic which leads to several problems like, waste of fuel, pollution, ambulance is not getting clear road to proceed, accidents, delay in reaching at destination etc
We are aware that govt is taking all best possible efforts to control it but at the same time it is every Indians moral responsibility to follow basis traffic rules. Jai Hind!

1 0 There is no caste based reservation in army because we know reservation reduce quality and make discrimination. Then why class A service have reservation.They made our policy.This one of the reason of defective policy. After 65 years we made policy based on caste not based on economic condition. In our country poor person in unreserved category is not fill complete independence. Remove caste based reservation. Poor and unemployed are in every caste not only in reserved caste.

0 0 Remove reservation system from india.. that should be the topic of the Independence day...

0 0 DEAR PM, Railways can develop rapidly if the center include state govts in their rly projects with 50:50 ratio. It can be possible through allocate every state one railway zone except N.E states. Revise the current railway zonal system where in 17 zones Maharastra and Westbengal contains two railway zones each and Gujarath and Andhra pradesh even does not have one. The States know well that how can they utilize railways for their development better than the central govt.

0 0 What better launch pad can be found for our future than our rich past?
Now, the time is ripe for us to leave behind an influenced mind-set, from which we have suffered for 4 centuries. Now is the time to realise we are free and go back to our glorious past. From there, will be reborn, the Greatness of India

0 0 I think Honorable P.M.may like to inspire people on climate change and sustainable development. he may also like to urge society to get rid of superstitions, bias of caste, creed, gender and be a good human at first place. I think Honorable Sir have commented on foeticide but reasons behind it such as insecure environment, dowry etc need to be attacked as well and tell people that girls will make nation bright in 21 century.

0 0 Namaste!As a nation,we have a past wealthier than any other.Scientifically,morally,spiritually &culturally we have always been leaps and bounds ahead of the rest of the world.Does it befit us to forget the history of thousands of years just because we have been oppressed for a few centuries?I agree that,as a country we have been oppressed, our spirit has been thrashed and tormented.But did we not get our freedom on this very day 68 years ago?What now is our excuse, not to return our past

1 0 Sir. As we all know India is quite young in relation to fact that majority of population is of youth.
And so I would suggest you to announce to start an scholarship program for senior secondary level student to PHD scholars in every subject such as economics. This should be a nation wide contest and winners should be given special prize and practical approach should be devleloped by inviting them to Delhi.
Thanks

0 0 the failure of the education system in india. the vyapam scam clearly shows the status of our education system.

Isn't now the time to abolish the reservation system in India. The Reservation system was made in order to uplift some castes/socities in India . But now the schedule castes or tribes in india have got way uplifted while the general are sinking below the par. so now its time to abolish this system.

0 0 the temples like tirupati, shirdi, etc.  where devotees come and donate large amount of money and gold. billions of rupees is collected in the form of donations. in tirupathi,they shave pupils hair and export them to other countries and earn billions of dollars. these money is dumped in the lockers thats all. i think they should invest these funds and help in countries growth instead of keeping the funds block in the lockers. this may become a turning point for our country.

0 0 Eligibility is 55% but colleges need 90% only if at all he has achieved good marks in the exams like CAT/GMAT etc. then why are you setting 55% as the eligibility criteria set it as 80 or 90% only. No average student would dream and dare to enter the TOP B-Schools at least. Why are we still highlighting basic qualification required as 50% If however a student performs good in the appearing exam He/She will not get a call from the TOP colleges as their academic record is Average.
Where do we go?

i think the independence day speech is not very much necessary considering the current plight of our nation because the government has destroyed all for which the nations founding fathers stood and believed in ,i express this with utmost contemp that even your government didnt carry out all the promises made before elections and they have just been in papers ,therefore i consider a fake speech just glorifying the few good aspects in our country is not needed

Please speak about  People’s President Dr APJ Abdul Kalam’s visions and missions of India. Our Former President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam once said, ” During our lifetime, if we plant 10 trees and nurture them, we will have over 10 billion trees. These 10 billion trees can definitely contain the climate change problem.” As a tribute to the Missile Man and one of the biggest inspirations of the youth, each one has to take oath to plant 10 trees if not atleast one tree.

0 0 Sir,
Regarding the retirement age of the Central/State govt. employees. The retirement age should be reduced to 55. As it not only increases the efficiency of the govt. in performing their job but immensely reduces the problem of unemployment. As it creates huge job opportunities for the youth due to the vacancy created. Lastly, a retired pensioner parent with an employed child is far better off than an unemployed child and a rigorously working parent in the house and in the nation.

During the pre-colonisation period our country flourished in many fields and was renowned to the whole world as "Bhaarath". Now my suggestion is that please restore the lost glory of our country by taking steps to rename our majestic country as "Bhaarath" which shall be our first step to revive the historical importance and the culture of our country.

0 0 my suggestion is as how we can divert flood water to the areas where there is scarcity of water and less rainfall in the country. this will help to control flood disaster and also farmers will be happy. the project is expensive but it will help us to control both scarcity and floods. it will be the project of rainwater harvesting where there will be no wastage of water at all. we can use it for agriculture as well as for drinking purpose. today farming is a big issue and this can be the solution

1.C.G.H.S Facilities or Health care facilities under Civil services Medical attendance rules (CSMA) should be extended to all Central Government Statutory and Autonomous bodies' employees all over the country. According to the present orders issued by Health Ministry while Dr. Harshvardhan was the Union Minister ; only employees of Delhi & NCR region were sanctioned these facilities. why  this discrimination ?

1 0 Respected PM,
The goverment should construct or develop 100 solar city throughout the nation like the 100 smart cities declared last year. The power supply for this city should be supplied from renewable energy resources.

And the coastal cities must produce electricity frm wind energy and wave energy like they do in Japan.

0 0 Sir,
I think a Health Insurance Scheme is to be initiated on compulsory basis for all the citizens at a very minimal rate, but with maximum facility. Where in our country, thousands die daily just because of the lack of proper medical facilities and insufficient funds, this scheme might act as a boon for the entire nation. A HEALTH INSURANCE CARD might as well be introduced. It is very ironic that in a country where an insurance for a car is a must, insurance to cover the health risks isn't.

0 0 Respected Sir, First priority should be save our ancient tradition, culture, value system. Too much left influence has eroded the self-belief of Indians to a great extent. First work on reviving the self-esteem, self-belief. People have forgot Indian culture, and badly impacted by these Private TV channels, Eng. News media, funded by foreign companies. High time need to put a full stop on these Breaking-India Forces, as written by Rajiv Malhotra. Pl rewrite our history, make it Bharat specific.

0 0 * More employment at working level in Police in states/UTs,in RPF etc,to minimise their stress levels,and equip them with modern arms,Free hand to Defence forces to deal field situations
* Multilevel mechanisms in all sensitive/corruption prone departments to make them more transparent
*Emphasise cordial relations with neighbouring countries,but firm to deal with mischievous adventures against India.Call for Global unity towards peace and mutual cooperation,respect for mutual sovereignty,…

0 0 Education system: need to be innovative/should help make people stand on their own. Free Progress method of Integral Education as coined by Sri Aurobindo need to be implemented. Rote learning method should go. Value based teaching required. Teachers need to be taught in age old Vedic math. and culture. Sanskrit teachers need to be hired to explore and spread the truth and message of Vedas n Upanishads n Sanskrit across globe. More importance to patents, innovation required. Tax system should go.

0 0 Respected Sir,
I would like to see a Tribal corridor in Odisha, MP, CGH, Andhra. Please visit those remotest areas more often and try to build a world class infra and industrial hubs in those region. All the dying condition of oldest temples across country should be revived. Please Connect all temple city by train and airports. Trains need to be soundproof, All bogeys in train should be AC. Give incentives to those companies who keep their surroundings clean. All universities shd be connected

0 0 PM sir, My 2 ideas.
1. Like the success of Yoga day in India and internationally, why not a blood donation day and invite all to donate blood voluntarily. Every one knows 1000s of patients die due to lack of blood in blood banks. This will be a great and generous move.
2.Our armed forces are suffering from shortage of officers. Many young guys like me never make it due to its tough selection process. Kindly change the upper age limit for CDS Entry to 26 years so we get more chance to apply.

0 0 *  Make RTI  applicable to  Political Parties
* If any candidate contests in any election from more than one constituency,  such individual must bear the election expenditure of additional constituencies , and also an amount equal to the costs of subsequent  bye elections thereof . Public exchequer should not bear such expenditure
* Candidates changing Party after wining election from another, shall automatically disqualify said 'win'/ seat after such change.They have to Re-contest and win.

0 0 Dear PM, My suggestion is to convey a message to the people of India, to be a part of terror-free India and to be co-operative and friendly in all aspect and not to differentiate between the people of India by their cast or religion.  We together have to work for the development of our nation and use our knowledge and energy for the nation.
Mr. PM, and also remind the life of our former President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and his dedication of his whole life to our nation.

0 0 #IndependenceDay-The Tricolor of our Nation should be used only for the National interest.
Any political party using the Tricolor must be stopped by law.
A particular political party holding the Tricolor as their own irritates and confuses the citizens. The claim that, they were holding it for long is no excuse at all. After all the practice of Sati, Child marriage, Verbal divorce etc. continued for many years were stopped by law. Why the use of Tricolor by political party cannot be stopped?

Encourage everybody to undertake rain water harvesting and also give them an assurance that government will provide unconditional support for this endeavour.This will give the people a new vigour to tackle the country-spanning water crisis.
I am adding an image to show one such idea which can be used for aforementioned purpose

0 0 Modi ji, we request you to bring equality in education, check the quality of education in all government schools. Education must be practical not just books.
Stop selling the agricultural lands and inspire students to learn about agriculture and realise its worth.
Tax should be paid for each every single product we buy. This might be a burden initially but make people understand that this will reduce the cost of products and increase the benefits for people.
Thanks for the opportunity

0 0 Respected PM modi ji,I request you that instead of speaking on 15 Aug. you should say something for unemployed good educated general class youth who was backed in last some years due to their caste not to their education.please equalise all caste because our India want development in every sector form up to down. so, for this only skill candidates are require to improve our country condition. sir i belong to general cast and i placed as additional candidates since last 1 years in RRB railway.

2.Speak how WORLD sew/sees INDIA before & now
3.Boast-India will be SUPER POWER soon
4.Inform COMMON MAN that he will see bright light
4.Ask billionaires to help poorer
5.Ask people to buy Indian Product,institution to create entrepreneurs

1 0 Empowering young women for easy mobility with independence: However rich or educated, today it is a pain for young women to move around freely without being accompanying by someone.

i am expressing something as i experienced in last 14 years..
Sir we are spending huge amount for urbanization and related infrastructure this is very good...but we can achieve this with minimum amount by developing all the junctions in our cities technically,theoretically and practically.If we are thinking infrastructure up gradation for any city first we must think about the major and minor junctions in that city...first we must develop that along with footpath,pedestrian crossing

THEY SHOULD NOT ONLY THINK OF THE PRESENT WELL BEING BUT THE PAST SACRIFICES AND FUTURE RESPONSIBILITIES.

0 0 Respected Sir,
I would like you to speak on the matter of SWACHCH GANGA ABHIYAN as it has been more then 14 months since the government came in rule but no actions are being implemented for our precious river.
I also want you to speak on Environment Conservation, as it is a big issue for us and the upcoming generations. We are 121 crore, if 1 person or even whole family plants a single seed on this independence day, imagine what a green India we will get in next 4 - 5 years.

1 0 Respected PM Narendra Damodar Das Modi Ji I humbly request you that instead of speaking on 15 august you should take some measures for the benevolence of the poorer sections of society n my question is that instead of spending too much money for the development of Nepal should we not use this for our own men??? According to me if it will be done than we should be raising the literacy rate n rate of development of our nation. Plz do not ignore this sir.Looking forward for ur reply on 15 August

0 0 OUT OF 127 CRORE, ONLY 10000 SUGGESTIONS TILL 11AUG, Modiji think why loss of popularity. ONLY DUE TO NON-ACTION AND ABSENCE OF MONITORING SYSTEM OF BIG SLOGANS/PROGRAMMES DECLARED SINCE MAY2014. Example-(1) you said 'trust the citizen,let him self-certify documents,but central govt offices continue to ask attestation by gazetted officer (2) you said in 1st secretaries meeting of June 2014, not-more-than-4-layers-of-WORKERS in offices, but not a single ministry is observing that. MODIJI THINK

0 0 it should not be fully govt funded, if the local people/organisations come up with a place and contributing minimum of 50% of the cost then only govt should fund rest.  the ownership will be with the panchayats and they can be awarded for better performance. this centres can be connected with a help centre/counselling centre to address the queries and questions of youth related to health, career, education and so on

0 0 Modiji, you promised before election that Hindus who are facing persecution in Bangladesh will be given citizenship. My doctor brother who did her MRCP in medicine from London is suffering daily ignominies in Dhaka, Bangladesh. There are thousands of educated Hindus who want to leave Bangladesh because of constant threat from Muslims. Please give citizenship promise to them. Their lives are like hell for them.You can save their children's future.

If we could create one library in each village with the help of local people and other like minded organisations and yoga has been practices here will be huge achievement.  In this libraries reserve mornings for girls and evenings for boys,the centres can be named "vivekanada centres".

Sir, from Mother Earth we get the potable water and which is safely preserved as long as it’s under the ground.  Still in millions of houses in our country, this nature’s precious gift can be seen going as waste, while pumping from bores.
I wish my Prime Minister to touch the issue of saving ground water during the Independence Day speech. If the issue is made a national issue, certainly we can change the water scenario in less than a decade.

0 0 to really celebrate independence day we should stop having it as a holiday and start working on this day. not only on 15 aug but all other holidays commorating diff. things. just imagine the man-days added each year and the push it will give to economy of our country and also help people earn more spl. daily wage earners. may be then we will achieve developed nation status in next decade or so.#PM, #IndependenceDay, #15thAugust, #MyGov

0 0 Dear Narendra Modi Sir, I am very much impressed with the Clean India Initiative. I am sure this will makes huge difference to the society in near future. Can we incorporate a new policy which will encourage the people to work in this direction. Enforcing the people to follow the rules accordingly to policy. Rules should be strict enough but ultimately it will help to our society only.

0 0 India has been churning out lot many Graduates than ever. If more people are educated, it means a better and happy society. However, this has not been happening. The academic institutions teach science, maths and languages, and not ethics. Although it's the duty of parents to inculcate ethics in their children, some thoughts from you, the PM, to inculcate ethics in the youth would help to create a better society.
A healthy society is one where everyone does their duties with honesty!

1 0 Independence Day of India has been celebrating only in Schools and govt offices. But actual Indians are unable to understand what is Independence, because they ruled by Kings, Muslim rulers Kings, Britishers, Portuguese and French. The fear of ruling by others (other than local citizens) is still exist due to the behavior and ruling methods of govt officers. Now every one of Indian citizen is proudly saying Local Indian Mr Modi ruling the Country. I salute you Sir. Change foreign rule methods ..

0 0 R/PM Sir,
There is always something to complain about, you are taking huge initiatives. But inspite of making new announcements or yognaye..just give the reports about the running schemes and make efforts towards them to complete in someway..If all that schemes and yognaye works then INDIA Will BE Golden BIRD..LIke earlier it was...INDIA is made up of The Great people, Hardwork, Intellegence, Morales.

3. Declaring Holiday is essential because I myself is employed in a private company and it is very tough to take out time for such activities during working week.
4. It would also let the international community know about our seriousness in answering climate change.

0 0 Dear Prime Minister,
As we all know that we had to increase the green cover in India to fight the climate change and environmental degradation, declaring June 5, the Environment Day, as National Holiday will help in following ways -
1. June 5 will be celebrated by planting trees. Even if one do it for selfies, the tree have been planted.
2. If 125 crore people plant trees every year on June 5, imagine the increase in tree cover after five years...

1 0 There is maximum wastage of electricity in Govt. offices. The lights, fans, ACs are found on, even after duties hours. ‘’Aaj Ki Bachat Kal Ki Suraksha’’.  This line will be true, if we  stop wasting  electricity. Suggestion: All govt.offices  be requested to reduce their electricity bills by switching off their lights, fans, ACs and other electrical appliances, when not required. The Head of the Govt, Departts may be given Cash Award/ Commendation Certificate for reducing the electricity bills.

0 0 I feel that sports in India is not looked upon seriously till the time it is commercialised. Any sportsman  who has represented India or State in any kind of sports should be offered a Government job, based on his caliber of course. It feels very demotivated when we see poor condition of sportsmen who have once upon a time represented India. We need to focus on that area for growth and motivation in sports. Vivek, Varanasi.

1 0 Sir,i am VISHAL SHARMA a 14 YEAR OLD STUDENT FROM GHAZIABAD.I am always fascinated to contribute in governmental affairs. I want you to organize education drives in villages so that the developing youth has atleast basic knowledge,morals and ethics. you must announce establishment of some governmental primary health care centres so that poor people can afford basic treatments.

0 0 The Pds is collosul wastage of money.please cancel this and give cash benefits as quality will never improve and middle men in India can only thrive.please also help the govt schools to be better in quality so all children in this country can get quality education. Please help in setting up garbage collection and disposal in cities rather than dumping this in landfills in poor villages. Govt should take ownership for roads and public transportation so that poor in country do not suffer

1 0 Education,being the backbone of the society, needs to be given priority and prominence in every possible way. That ensures the upliftment of a country beyond the horizon.Undoubtedly India is lagging much behind in this field compared to other so called developed countries.A mode that we can operate to eradicate this deficit of ours is to globalize our educational system with special emphasis on professional education.

0 0 Establish a common India centric framework for a new project management standard ISO 21500 so that all social projects have effective and timely delivery to the citizens.

0 0 Just like Consolidated Fund of India & Contingency Fund of India, setup Defence Fund of India into which every citizen of India can be asked to pay Rs. 10/- per month voluntarily and the money thus deposited in this Fund can be used to make investments or improvements of R&D environment of defence PSUs like HAL DRDO etc or help Government of India buy more advanced weapons to guard its borders. I am sure people of India atleast from Metros will participate actively to make this a success. #PM

0 0 Need laws clearly to help and provide security to women. Laws that ensure any rape or molestation to be charged with punishment of at least 3 years in jail with just a police complaint.laws that enable women and daughters and wives to inherit property, uniform civil code like the Portuguese law giving authority to even daughter in laws to inherit husbands property,education benefits for daughters of this country and rights to women so that she has respect in her in laws house

1 0 Dear sir
 My idea for this independent speech is to make awareness about advantage of paying tax.I want the Indian people comes to know if everybody who comes under tax slab has to pay there tax. Because right now only 4% people pay tax,which is neglible ratio with the current population, if 50 or 60% people file their tax then our economic growth as well all kind of development can be easily possible. Please make convience to our Indian people don't escape filling tax.,

0 0 Green economy needs to be given a thrust to overcome the fuel and oil crisis. Countries like Brazil have used it successfully to provide better avenues to their farmers specially the sugar cane farmers where the waste can be used to generate biogasse. With farmer suicides and oil costs we need the honorable Narendra Modiji to find fresh avenues for bio fuels.When the late Kalam was President he had started Jatropa cultivation as an alternative fuel.Reliance stopped further research I guess later

0 0 Many laws have been made to protect our women from sexual assaut, rape, molestation. After Nirbhayaa Case, country was looking for a law to protect woman from such incident.Even after framing of POCSO ACT 2013, there is no control over such incidents.
All these incidents can be controlled only by raising moral education to youth, motivating them towards spritual life, rennovating our joint family culture. Motivating them to be aim focused. Parents should be made cautious of their kids routine.

2 0 Let our independence day slogan be “Freedom from Unaccountability”. Let’s form one law to make all segments accountable for their duties, with appraisals and performance trackers to weed out low and no-performers. By turning this law into a social movement, parliamentary and other processes will fall in place. A new Performance Investigation Bureau (PIB) and Corruption Investigation Bureau (CIB) to monitor all services will transform a sluggish India into a meritocratic and efficient global hub.

In every district one food park to set in which every states food to introduce or make available to it we have several dishes special food in India but due to improper set up and marketing we are at loosing side if we introduce benefit 1 start course at every ITI college will increase skill development and employment opportunities require huge instructor for teaching so for household women who make delicious food with other who want to make carrier

0 0 Sir,
Political ideologies may differ with political parties.  Regarding economic font for a long term country economic growth, all political parties should be united and should take a collective responsibility.  Short term gains, parties should not think about.  The goal should be  country progress and economic growth.  Any programme we should start, it should first reach the gross root level of the society then that programme will be successful. Regarding energy front non-renewable energy idea

First of all I would like to congratulate you on the Digital India initiative which is turning out to be a grand success. The bio metric system has came out to be most effective as employees now are less absent & more conscious. Sir recently an unfortunate incident took place at Gurdaspur. Our soldiers must be provided latest bullet proof vests as well as arms. We are the major exporter of such vests and its the govt. responsibility to provide them to its soldiers. Jai Hind Sir.

1 0 The error in the Judiciary is only modified or reversed in Higher courts for which the poor citizen need to spend money. Further there is no time line fixed for disposal of any case. The lawyers sit as judges in the same place. There is no policy in appointments. They enjoy leave as School Children which other pillar don't have.
A judge giving wrong judgement in certain number of cases need to be removed.
Please reform the Judiciary. Many points raised are there in law comm recommendation.

0 0 Respected Sir,
The functioning of Judiciary in our country need to be put on check. They are behaving like the one which is Supreme and cannot be questioned by anyone in the earth. The Judicial unaccountability prevailing is leading to Mockery of Judiciary. When our country is having system of accountability for two pillars out of three why not for the remaining one. If a politician or an official does any error he is answerable however there is no thing for a Judge Committing error. Why So.

Help of Dr.M.S.Swaminathan like scientist will be productive. Use of Bio fertilizers need emphasis. Advice people to cooperate for countries development by accepting land reforms. There are too many unemployed youths, they need employment creation. only way out is use of technology and accepting hard reforms. Land is the main factor for infrastructure growth

0 0 Sir, pl ensure that e-waste is properly and scientifically collected and disposed of. An awareness campaign has to be created on high scale.
2) Lack of coordination among various service providers. Roads are laid. Then BSNL digs the road. Again road is laid. Then, metrowater digs. Again road is damaged. Drainage is laid and some BSNL cables are snapped. This has become a cycle resulting in a huge unnecessary expenditure and avoidable inconvenience to the public.

0 0 Dear PM
I congratulate you for the effort you have put in for the betterment of Indian citizens. God bless you. I worried much about the judicial system of India. Slowly people loosing the faith on our judicial system. The recent verdicts given by the courts on scam cases disappointed everyone. Person having power and wealth can easily escape from any case. How you are going ensure judicial system is corruption free one.

0 0 Dear Sir,
People always show their arrogance everywhere. This makes the society as non-conducive.
Hence please make the slogan “Avoid Arrogance”. . Love and affection is a selective approach
Whereas   “ AA”  can be by all and by all-time without any restriction to all spheres of life.
      Courts/GOVTs/Large sections of people could not apply love and affection to terrorists or any anti -idealists.  But they all can do “AA”.
With Regards.

1 0 I would like to see a War Memorial and National War Museum for all the forgotten soldiers of India who sacrificed their lives for the country. I would like to see a Freedom Fighter Museum in each state, where those forgotten heroes of each state need to be acknowledged and respected. I would like to see a Poets and Writers Gallery where each writer of states need to be respected. People need to be aware of India's age old culture of Rishi and Munis, Centre should create Vedic Training centres

0 0 List your achievements in the last one year.  Coal auction.  Higher power supply.  Toilets for schools and beti bachao abhiyan.  Also mention saved country from the Italian Mafia.  High light Foreign policy gains.

0 0 Sir, I suggest that for schools we can have one day each week to discuss class subjects by using domain expertise.  This will be like Khan lectures available on the WEB.    Each subject particularly maths and science can be broad cast as per syllabus  in school.Sir we need to bring disrepute to the paid and biased news shown on pvtnews channnels.  How are they getting access to defence matters etc. Nitiesh kumar twists your comment on DNA. Explain how all humans have same DNA.But not politicians

0 0 Most of the NPAs in Banks are from influential people. Banks are only after small defaulters. Banks should be directed  to disclose the names of  NPAs.

0 0 We all knew how CORRUPT the Central and State Govt.staffs are.Most of them take salary and pension for mere attendance.For service they take Bribe by eating Govt revenue.A VDIS & VDWS scheme for them alone is to be announced.

0 0 Dear Sir,
Let's start treating COWS as our family member and cruelty against all the animals must stop , what an IRONY that LIONS who do not contribute to us we have made sanctuaries for them whereas COW gives us life saving foods , love & affection , symbol of purity and teaches us simplicity , humility and service , we have not provided them any place to spend their rest of life .SO let's take pledge that we will provide proper place for the cows to be in the green fields and spend their life

1 0 If the Central Government staff of the CBDT and CBEC are not corrupt then , we will be able to collect at least DOUBLE the present collection. In comparison the CBEC is more corrupt.The Service Tax collection is easily met with out much effort from the staff, it is automatic. So the department is using Show Cause notices as a tool for money making. The present threshold  limit of 10 L is to be enhanced to at least 25 L.Strong message to  be given to these department staffs against GRAT.

0 0 Dear sir, you are our primeminister and everyone respects you and listen to you, specially when you are in lal quila for the great moment of anniversary for our independence.

0 0 Respected Sir,
Coming straight to the point. As an Indian citizen I would like to see a pie chart of where the spending goes every year. How much is spent on each category. This will be very useful to he average citizen and it should be available at the governmet website for India.
Also give an award to the city or state that did a great job on the swach bharat agenda!

0 0 Dear sir , your efforts towards women empowerment is laudable. Beti bachao , Beti padhao  initiative is a sincere attempt to highlight the importance of women education in India . This will ultimately lead to more and more women in jobs. Unfortunately , there are many obstacles for women to continue in employment . As the evidence suggest , many women struggle and simply couldn't continue in full time employment because of family commitment . It is really a  daunting  task to balance the child

0 0 care ,household duties and the job.
I think it would be extremely helpful if there is a provision of flexible working for female employees. They should have the legal right to request flexible working. this is quite common in western world and is one of the  important factor influencing high female employment rates.
Flexible working includes part time working or job sharing . It would be a significant step forward if your government could bring some legislation which provide a

0 0 Dear PM,
To improve education system please change medium of study to English in all government schools so that even poor children can study in English medium which will open better career opportunities for them. Various countries effaced their local language and adopted English as their national language and developed very well like Ireland, Singapore. Now even their local less literate people are able to do business internationally. On 15th Aug please announce English as national language.

0 0 "The health of our civilization and our concern for the future is tested by how well we support our libraries"
On this independence day, let us acknowledge the need to build temples of learning in every city of the country. Our children need to learn, to grow. They need libraries to provide them the atmosphere where they can learn and gain knowledge. Development of libraries should be a announced as a focus area for the Niti Aayog, Ministry of Culture and MHRD.

0 0 To make our country "developed" each of our thought, word and action should be "this country will be made developed and prosperous country by me"instead of "I will make myself developed and prosperous". For, the starting point for all ills around us is the importance we give to the word "I". When we do this, happiness will come to all of us, and each person will have a share of the same. The other way none of us will be happy.

0 0 Everyone should promote tourism in India , to get an additional forex exchange and indirect or direct job for the people of India.In order to do that first we need to ensure to clean the city,and increase the tourist destination. There are lot of touristic place ,which are far beyond the imagination ,however no one is aware about those places.... My request you Mr.Modi , to develop the team who is looking after the tourism and cleanliness in India.

0 0 It would be the best part beheading the scary feelings under the peoples of west Bengal and Assam specially
The normal people who were allowed to vote did that with a hope of better uplifment
It's only you who can help
And make them feel secured
Come and see the ground reality

0 0 Disabled access of all buildings, bus, trains etc. Pedestrians and cyclists access of roads. Why can't we have separate roads for cycles, pedestrians? There is a lot to include.

0 0 Dear Prime Minister
I would really keenly request you to show some signs of relief to the peoples of west bengal,Assam and kerela
m sure enough that you are very well aquinted with the real problems being faced by these three states
On dis independence day make them feel proud they are Indian a country where u aquire freedom in every sense
Give signs of hope to the peoples who are in scary mode staying in their own country

1 0 We also need to address the issue of OROP and try to motivate the youth to join the service of nation. Defence, administration; all of them. A soldier who is dying for the country expects that the govt is going to take care of his family. Can we ensure that the families of martyrs are not humiliated by clerks etc.

0 0 Dear Sir, we have such a nasty neighbor. A neighbor who is suicidal. With such a neighbor plus the growing power of IS, taliban and other similar terrorist groups; how safe our borders are? Are we ready to defeat the enemy?
No matter what we say, people of India are living in denial of Islamic terrorism. Please assure the nation on these issue.

0 0 Respected Narendra  Modiji,
This Independence Day we can start/announce a train called "SWACCHTA EXPRESS" whose route will look like a 'garland of cleanliness''Swacchta ki mala' as seen on railroute map when it covers the circuit route:Delhi-Ahmedabad-Mumbai-Goa-Kanyakumari-Chennai-Kolkata-Varanasi-Delhi...stopping at these 8 stations completing the circuit like a mala.It will be a symbolic gesture towards cleanliness & a constant conscious reminder to public towards this issue.

0 0 In context of swach bharat abhiyaan,I have noticed that,it is the clean roads and streets which give a city clean look. We never peep in someone house and comment about cleaniness. It is the roads and streets which make up our mind about cleaniness of a place. Cleaniness should be in form of infrastructure and disciplined traffic. Sir,our government must  pay special attention towards PAVEMENTS and TREES on both side of roads in towns,to get rid of garbbage and dirty mud on road sides.

0 0 On the occasion of this Independence Day Let us all vow that we will give preference to the Nation and the well being of the Nation over everything else. Let us all come under one religion that is 'BHARAT DHARM'. Our freedom with respect to our religion of birth need not be undermined. As the citizens of this Nation we should love and serve each other as brothers and sisters and respect each other's religion. If we can do this it would be the greatest service to the Nation.

0 0 We are very much pleasure to have a such broad minded PM for our country. We like to hear some announcement about "CONNECTING RIVERS ACROSS INDIA" which was initiated and dream project for our Farmer Prime Minister Atal bihari Vajpayee. The average rainfall in India is reducing year by year and ground level water is went down from 2000 to 5000 ft. Furthermore the rain across the nation is not uniform, the east and north gets most of the rain, while the west and south get less.

0 0 Sir, your call for building toilets at schools for girl children has also yielded fruit. There was a large scale movement for building toilets at schools. Sir, please earmark more funds for maintainace and unintruppted functioning of these toilets for next 25 years so that this facility at schools do not face apathy of shortage of funds.

0 0 Sir..we are in 21st century n do you think there is still a need of caste based reservations in INDIA
If the same continues the government will be for the RESERVED people and not for so called DESERVED ones.
Caste based reservations are ruining the lifes of lots of people.
This is the main reason behind BRAIN DRAIN.
Look at the real time example in that image

0 0 Sir, your call for swach bharat abhiyaan is yielding fruits. Now I have personally observed that our society has become aware about keeping surroundings clean. The time has approched where by our administration should step in and take appropriate measures to collect and dispose off garbbage efficiently and at a larger scale . For this our government must prepare an blue print for entire country. Sir, encouragment has worked...!!

0 0 As a society it is important to remember that we as a nation have survived and thrived because of our unique social fabric that values tolerance and inclusiveness. It is these values which allows to harness our diversity as our strength when it can easily turn to be our weakness. So we have to commit to these values and not let our vulnerabilities exposed for our enemies to use it as a tool to hinder our growth as a vibrant diverse and secular nation..!!!....

0 0 Sir, please encourage middle and upper class families of our society to avail health facilities delivered by health dept at government hospitals.Its Benefits:a. This will bridge gap between poor and rich. b. Seeing wealthy people getting treatment at government hospital will set a role model for poor and they will not waste money at private hospitals for health facilities available at govt. hospital free of cost. c. Affulent people can assist local health authorities in improving health services

0 0 Respected Sir. Suggested theme “Unstoppable India:  From Smart cities to Smart villages” as a tribute to the late Dr Kalam, who envisioned developed India by empowering rural India.
 “Bharat” being referred to those residing in villages (70%) did not benefit as much as” India” did (30%) from the high growth. Any growth can be meaningful if it bridges this gap and reaches the last man i.e. true Antyodaya!
  “Saansad Aadarsh Gram Yojana” can  be expanded to develop many  “Smart villages”

0 0 Sir, 
Part 2 / 2: 
In the continuing theme of 'LOOK BEHIND" & 'LOOK BEYOND" for the Independence Day Address, issues concerned with the SWATCHH BHARAT ABHIYAAN are addressed. It's one year, since Hon'ble PM expounded the theme of SWATCHH BHARAT from the ramparts of red fort, truly marking a red letter day, in terms of Clean India Campaign. 
The same is covered in the part 2/2 series of Inputs to Ind. Day Address. 
Jai Hind ! Jai Bharath !! Vande Mataram !!!

First & foremost…..,
Independence Day is not just a celebration of Independence / Freedom, but a day to remember the past……as Every Indian owes deepest gratitude to all these FREEDOM FIGHTERS, known or unknown, named or unnamed, Leader or Jawaan, due to whose selfless efforts, INDIA ATTAINED FREEDOM & INDEPENDENCE IN 1947!
LET THIS INDEPENDENCE DAY BE SPECIAL, A VERY SPECIAL IN THE MEMORY OF ALL THOSE UNNAMED / UNKNOWN / UNCROWNED “JEWELS” OF OUR NATION!
JAI HIND!

1 0 Honorable PM, in the recent Swachh Bharat survey rankings, your constituency,  Varanasi ranks 416 in the list out of 476 cities surveyed. So what do you have to say to the people of your constituency and to the cities which are at the bottom of the list? AND What about the 20,000 Crores allocated to the Namami Gange Scheme?

0 0 "Highlight Creative Insight"
the fact that students are running behind jobs and not following their real passion inside.'Engineers and doctors are somebody who get paid' , this misconception should be cleared off frommindset of the young.creativity like arts, music dance fashion should be encouraged
Indians follow the concept of bhed chaal me chalna.which is not bringing the best out of the young vibrant minds.
Linking ancient roots of creative arts with modern talents can elevate Indians.

0 0 Respected sir
sir we all know ,India has to repay $172 billion debt and it still increasing every day ,
sir a programme should be started in which person who are interested can donate in this programme.
this programme should be keep away from any kind of politics and should be transparent so that every one should believe in this programme.
sir this money should be used to repay debt to world bank.
this is our country we should worry about it

0 0 respected prime minister sir,
Meerut was the city where revolt of 1st struggle of independence started and was the place to inspire the whole movement further , we request you to include birth place of India's first struggle of independence in smart city

0 0 2. India accepting to cut down its relation with Iran was fine, given the noble cause! But provided the recent lifting of US sanctions, I completely think there is a need to say sorry, for unintentionally hurting them! Your foreign visits has indeed taken India's global image to unprecedented heights! But this particular deed is best done standing on Indian soil! I'm not asking to say sorry exactly, but an acknowledgment towards the oldest friend who always stood by us. Make us feel independent!

0 0 Problem Of CASTE DISCRIMINATION AND CASTE BASED RESERVATION both can be solved by mean of the INTER-CASTE MARRIAGES so I request you to take steps to Encourage INTER_CASTE MARRIAGES.
when we see too different colours we can discriminate them but if mixed together you can not make difference between them.Same is the case with Social problems if we mix them together half of the problem is solved. So please take up this issue On Independence day and this will message will reach every one

0 0 as we can see from long time pension schemes are pending for defense like one rank one pension scheme. Kindly start this scheme as soon as possible because they dying for India for us only.
at least provide pension for those who sacrifices their life in terrorist attacks, border securities etc.

0 0 Dear sir,
I thing we want you share in your speech that maximally Indian students who studies in Indian Institute of technology are studying on subsidized expenses and after completing their courses they work for India. They work for some other developed countries which is not helping our country. please provoke them to work for India. 
We are spending around 988 crore in a year for this students. My suggestions subsidized studies will be for them only who will work for India.

0 0 Dear PM,
I have two suggestions!
1. Make in India is a wonderful concept! I would like to hear if you have any plans to start a Make for India campaign on similar lines! And I would definitely like to know if you have any  plan to come up with a financial support scheme for young entrepreneurs in India! I would also like to know if our PM wants the youth of this country to contribute to Make in India or rather employed with one of the companies that come to make in India?

0 0 Respected Sir,
I feel the term "Independence Day" as an insult to our freedom fighters. By terming 15 August as Independence Day, we are recognizing some other country's achievement rather than our freedom fighters.
We should honor our freedom fighters. So I would request you to please consider changing this term from "Independence Day" to "National Day". This will make us feel proud and we will remember their sacrifices rather than some other country's achievement.

0 0 Dear sir,
I need to ask to every politicians of India and supreme court of India that in 2015 monsoon satr of parliament Indian government has spended approximately 300 crore and work is almost nil in parliament. Now who will compensate this money which was eared and paid by citizen of India. Just because few corrupt politicians or anti government politicians are sitting in Indian Parliament so they have got right to waste the money.

0 0 We have been spending billions of rupees for development. But all these will be in vein with out people's participation and co operation. Just for example for the success of swatch bharath abhiyan people should also be a part of it by not letting their premises get littered. So the very best way to make a glorious future is by starting from our schools.We should make a socially responsible,politically motivated future generation by restructuring our educational system. #responsiblegeneration

0 0 DEAR SIR,
PLEASE DECLARE SETTING UP OF TEACHING/TRAINING INSTITUTES IN INDIA (AND ABROAD) TO GIVE BEST TRAINING TO INDIANS TO GET TOP JOBS(BEST ADMINISTRATORS,BEST DOCTORS ETC.) ACROSS THE WORLD.DECLARE AWARDS TO THOSE SENT HIGHLY INNOVATIVE IDEAS.

0 0 Dear Sir, We stay in a country where we give equal love and respect to Humans, but nothing much is happening towards the strays dogs only that they are being sterilized. Being an animal activist, if there is any initiative that the govt can also look at getting some medical support for them and start their Rabbis Vaccination Program. There can be more awareness in the way we treats them & not hit and beat them. They are also a equal part of the society, but only without words but loads of Love.

0 1 Dear sir, few more suggestions
1. Control and awareness on the usage of pesticides in the agriculture field.
2. Ban, heavy fine and life time imprisonment for people who are behind the poisoning the food, water etc. In India nowadays, any one can sell anything. If one brand banned, they will come with another name. This has to be stopped.
3. Assingn some task to each educational institution based on their level. E.g: a civil engg dept can help in any civil activity of local body per year.

0 0 Dear sir,
Our country politics is still running on electricity, water. After independence of approximately 70  years. Their are so many countries in the world who got freedom after us but still they too much develop as compare to India. I would request you to please tell you ministers and MLA's to solve these problem in their working tenure at in their area. Rather giving the speeches in election just to win. every year same thing is happening but no one is solving these problems.

In order to protect the interests of the Farmers, a  permanent and active national and state institution can be created.

If this continues,farmers population reduces as time passes.And there will be hardly countable number of farmers in the country.

0 0 Dear #PM sahib.
 I am a student. Being a male student and that too without a quota is pretty difficult these days. There are so many top institutions in which we don't get admission, just because of some other SC/ST/OBC candidate who is more well off financially but is far behind in academics than most of the general students are. You have a plan for a skill based India, but the reservation system that prevails has many flaws in it and does more harm to the general candidates

0 0 Dear Prime Minister,
Its a great platform you have provided to the common public, so that they can share their views and feel that they are heard.
I also wanted to capitalize on this opportunity to share one of my ideas.
Details are present in the attached PDF.

0 0 We study diligently for competitive exams, later realizing that the seat that we sweat for day and night is taken by a student who did not even score half the marks that we did. The system needs a change. Reservations based on caste are creating further alienations.This is not the equality our constitution proposes. Please find time to read this and ponder upon the harms that this system is creating. We need a meritorious India, not and India in the shambles of the quota system.

0 0 Dear Modi sir, We want to hear what is your plans in creating a transparent government/ corrupt free government offices. I want to hear concrete steps taken to address farmer issues, my dad and brother have left there good jobs to pursue agricultre and I want to know how can my brother make a career out of agriculture, how do we make agriculture also an industry where people participate like any other manufacturing industry or tech industry.

0 0 Dear Sir,
JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED :Please do something to resolve the time delays which is happening in all the courts .I suggest that make judges accountable for timely clearance of the cases and some portion of the salary to be linked with the performance on timelines. They are responsible citizen of INDIA so they must take this responsibility.The entire WORLD is making mockery of us for the delays in JUSTICE.

3.	Environmental laws pertaining to conservation of aquatic animals, water pollution and cleaning of rivers maid thorough revision by concerned expert.

0 0 Respected Prime minister,
I'd like to suggest you to give speech about our NATIONAL GAME.Because in India if we ask a kid to name the cricket players he may be able to tell all the players,and even international players.But if we ask to name any 1 hockey player there will be no answer.Not only the kid but even if we ask an adult also there will be no answer.So make our citizens aware that our national game is Hockey not cricket.I'm not telling to discourage cricket but to encourage HOCKEY.

0 0 Respected Prime Minister,
In India due to the extensive use of fuels there may be scarcity of fuel in the upcoming years.Hence I kindly request you to encourage and make aware to farmers to grow plants like JATROPHA and HONGE which yields BIO FUEL. As JATROPHA is a hard plant which can grow on any type of soil,under any kind of agro-climatic condition,can easily propogated through seeds or stem cuttings. It grows very fast.Moreover it is not grazed by animals even during the periods of drought.

मैं जब भी दैनिक अख़बार पढ़ती हूँ हर दिन दो या तीन ख़बरे तो बलात्कार की होती ही हैं वो भी बर्बरता से परिपू्र्ण पढ़कर मन ही मन रोती हूँ और सोचने लगती हूँ कि आख़िर क्या किया जाये कि इस पर लगाम लगे? प्रधानमंत्री जी मैं आपसे ये कहना चाहती हूँ कि क्या हमारे स्कूलों में छोटी क्लासेस से ही लड़कियो को कोई फाइटिंग आर्ट का प्रशिक्षण अनिवार्य नही बनाया जा सकता?

1 0 On the one hand there is unemployment in country and on the other hand various government posts are vacant and works are at snail pace due to shortage of human resource.Even judiciary is in peril.

0 0 Is it not possible to operate a train one from each state on the lines of Rajdhani Express but with all sleeper coaches having facilities of catering,besdsheets etc. that are given in Rajdhani Express with a price higher than superfast trains say 30% more than those so that dreams of poor and disadvantaged people who do not have means to afford higher prices of Rajdhani Exp. can fulfill their desire.It will be a advantage for general people especially farmers.

0 0 Sir, I strongly feel that growing population is cause of many problems faced by our nation. Family planning program has been awfully neglected by the previous govt. during last 35yrs. I am quite sure that same filling is haurbered by majority of our country man. I am 68yrs old, older then u has retired from U.P. Medical n health services, I will consider it fruitful in regard to the nation service if family planning program gets representation in your speech even for few seconds only.

0 0 मेरे नाना किसान हैं, वो आपको, अपने गाँव में बैठकर सुनने वाले हैं, उनके जैसे करोड़ों किसान भी. इस वर्ष प्रधानमंत्री जी आपको किसानों की त्रासदी पर सीधे उन्हें संबोधित करना चाहिए. किसानों के लिए आय सुनिश्चित करने वाली उन्नत फसल बीमा प्रणाली की ज़रुरत है. सिंचाई व्यवस्था को मज़बूत बनाने की शुरुआत तो आपने की है, पर निचले स्तर पर अधिकारी तवज्जो नहीं देते, जिससे योजना मेरे नाना, यानी आखिरी किसान तक नहीं पहुंचती. उन्नत तकनीकों से प्रति एकड़ उत्पादन बढाने को भी ज़रूर कहियेगा किसानों से, आपकी बात मानेंगे वो.

0 0 More people should fly the tricolour in our country - outside shops, on offices and rooftops. For example, here in America many fly the American flag on top of the buildings. We do not see the tricolour in India that often, but when more people mount the tricolour on their properties it will bring patriotism in all that see it and encourage them to make a better India. It will remind all not to pollute, etc. Seeing the flag everywhere will unite all and symbolise what we represent as a country.

0 0 Dear sir,
I've the following suggestions
1. In the memory of Dr. Kalam please announce the naming of an Aircraft Carrier after him. INS Kalam on the high seas would strike fear in the hearts of our enemies and inspire confidence among citizens, as Dr. Kalam himself did!
2. Please announce an WOMAN FOR SCIENCE initiative to encourage more girls to take up Science and Research, starting at school level. We cannot be leaders in Technology with such poor proportion of women in the field.

         I would like to suggest my idea of bringing all of the Police forces under the control of The President as it is in case of the armed forces i.e Army, Navy and Air Force. This will minimise cases of corruption, influence of political leaders, businessmen on cases and their investigation.

0 0 Basic 3 Sectors that impacts an economy -
Education
Heath & medicare facilities
Employment 
Solution to all three -
Control population
Control pollution
Control corruption 
India is estimated to cross china & will become most populous country of the world which itself gives rise to all other basic problems that an economy faces .
So control of population should be the prime focus in coming years .

0 0 Dear Pradhan Sevak,
Please make music compulsory in primary school. Music is a great leveller & will unite people across caste and religion. Music can reach into our senses where yoga cannot. Whereas yoga is seen, unfairly, as a religious tool, Music will have no such disadvantage. Sa Re Ga Ma or Do Re Me would be one and the same for our soul. No religious fanatic can accuse you of partisan treatment. Above all music is such a healer of soul. Please consider my request.

0 0 1) Throw a technology challenge to our technocrats and techies on how to control harmful Internet content. Let them come up with workable solutions 2) Just like Union and Railway budget, make every govt. dept. like Education, Home, Law etc. to give a annual status report in parliament. Make our officers produce these with plan, action, outcome etc. 3) Save our forests and farm lands. Its the only real wealth we have and beware mainly villagers vote. 4) Forget controversies, focus on Development.

0 0 The First SAMASTHAN Which merged with the Independent India is Pudukkottai SAMASTHAN in 03.03.1948.
Iron man Sardar VALLABHAI PATEL was instrumental in the merger and hence a STATUE of the Leader has to be erected in the District.

0 0 In the light of the facts set out above, we the general public of Pudukkottai  District once again kindly request the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India  for setting up the AIIMS in Pudukkottai District in preference to all the  other Districts   recommended by the Government of Tamilnadu.

0 0 India’s first women doctor,  Padma Bhushan (1956)Dr. MUTHU LAKSHMI REDDY belongs to this district but till date, there is no medical college in this district.  She was instrumental in establishing the cancer institute in Adayar Chennai spreading its name and fame in the whole of Asia and other countries. The Government of Tamil Nadu has also named a Scheme after her  sanctioning of Rs.12,000/- for Maternity Benefits.

0 0 Sir, Recently you have announced that “AIIMS” will be started in Tamilnadu. It will be, befitting tribute to start it in Pudukkottai, the birth place of  Dr. MUTHU LAKSHMI REDDY, an icon of female emancipation, our district holds lots of potential to become a front ranked district, with the coming of institutions like “AIIMS”.

0 0 Please save India’s dominance in IT by setting up an institution which provides impetus, policies, guidance, and governance for developing, fostering, adopting latest IT & ITES trends. India IT is still focused on tabular and program based system development & support. Now we are in the era of cognitive computing, there are signs showing we are lagging behind.
Solutions under Digital India are obvious systems. Need to take it to next step else we will be pushed back by many steps.

0 0 Respectable Modi Ji,
The word Independent should give our people real independence from all the fields like medicine, education, water scarcity.
The role of generic medicine in India is only negligible. It should be increased. Generic medicine should be made available to all the people in India to reduce the death rates. More efforts should be taken to make availability of generic medicines.Organic farming should be brought back as a way of paying tribute to Dr.Kalam as it was his last wish.

हर बच्चे को लगता कि भारत के विकास का कारवां आगे बढ़ रहा है और वह कहीं पीछे छूट गया है धूल फांकने के लिए।
हमें उनको भारत-विरोधी या पाक-समर्थक ठहराने से खुद को रोकना होगा। मैं दावे के साथ कहता हूं कि उनमें से ज्यादातर ऐसे नहीं है। यह सही है कि ये गुस्से में हैं और उनका गुस्सा वाजिब भी है क्योंकि इन्हें लगता है कि भारत के साथ रहकर उन्हें कुछ नहीं मिला है, और वे सोचते हैं कि अगर वे भारत से अलग होते तो उनके हालात बेहतर होते।

0 0 #PM, #IndependenceDay: Net neutrality is nothing but data socialism. It should be maintained as it is. But it can be effectively used to reduce crimes against women. The speed of every porn website has to be lowered regularly. Government has to give strict instructions regarding this to internet service providers. If India adopts this suggestion, it could be a milestone in social development. Neutrality is not applicable to services affecting national security and integration.

केंद्र सरकार और स्थानीय प्रशासन की उनकी भलाई में कोई रुचि नहीं है। यह सोच इतनी मजबूत है कि उन सबमें 'इंडिया' के खिलाफ एक जैसा गुस्सा है। और प्रशासन को यह मालूम होते हुए भी कि युवाओं में इंडिया के प्रति यह गुस्सा है, उसने इसे खत्म करने की दिशा में कभी कोई कदम नहीं उठाया। नतीजा ये भोलेभाले बच्चे भारत के खिलाफ कही हर बात पर यकीन कर लेते हैं। राज्य में मौजूद शरारती तत्व इस स्थिति का फायदा उठाते हैं और वे जो भी बकवास इन्हें सुनाते हैं, वे मान जाते हैं

With Water becoming the most precious commodity every passing year, there should be a policy on Water Management, to ensure our future generations have access to clean potable water.
(1) Making Rain Water Harvesting Mandatory in all residential and commercial buildings to improve Ground Water Level
(2) Creation and Maintenance of all Water Bodies - big or small
(3) Policy on improving Greenery in all households to improve rainfall in the country
(4) Proper treatment of WasteWater

Making positive thoughts among the Indians.
Also what was the plans you had before taking up the responsibilities. What are the tasks that you were able to complete.  Poll promises score card against actual. Problems that you are facing and your planned counter measures.
Food Corporation of India and agri industry need to be revamped in order to fulfill the dream of no indian sleeping with hunger.

0 0 states in india should be demarcated in straight lines as in the U.S,instead ofcurves and twists.the four southern states were formed along the linguistic basics,this is also one of the reason for quarelling over the sharing of river water and other pretty things.the boundary lines should be redrawn in sucah a way that noone linguistic people should be predominately present in a state.in other words the newly carved out states should incorporate,two or three languages speaking peoples

Sir, main focus of all the schools is to teach there students the following three things:-
1. How to speak in English, 2. How to operate computer & 3. How to earn.
Not even a single school bothers about the basic principals of life, morals, ethics and values.
The condition of Govt. Schools is pathetic.
Sir please make it comparably for all Govt. Employees (All Grades) to admit there children only in a govt. school.

0 0 Sir,A strong message should go to those who want to create hurdles in our country's growth and unity. As you are very sincerely focusing on skill development, science, tourism, digital india, I think one 24X7 seperate TV channel should be run by only professionals where any creative mind could show his/her skills on TV. For example if any young student is putting his/her efforts to create any model for a new invention should be shown on this channel which will boost more creativity for others.

0 0 Sir,What your doing for India is great. You have started many programs within a small duration. But many people did not what are the projects you started.You should also make them aware of the benefits of those programs. Sir one more thing is what ever is happening in parliament is not at all good for us. Why are you silent on these issues sir.People are talking about these issues and whoever kept great belief in you are waiting for your statement. Sir please give strong statement on this.

0 0 Rural Development: 1.There is a need to develop a cooperating system between rural citizens and industries. In an area farmers can do farming of a crop according to the need of an industry in that area. For ex. An industry needs grains and cereals as its raw materials, so farmers can grow crops of cereals and sell it to that industry. An industry needs storage for storing raw materials and products. Farmers can cooperatively build a storage with the financial help of that industry.

0 0 Hope - India needs hope now. Our countrymen all around are working towards making India a better place to live in. Unfortunately the media focus has been only on the negative things that are happening around completely ignoring the great work being done by many common men everyday.

Awards like Padma bhushan, Padma vibhushan etc should be set aside for people doing work for society or country to encourage everyone.

This would develop villages and stop migration into cities also transportation, business activities and availability of daily needs will be easy

2 0 Prime Minister's message is for the benefit of the entire population of this country including those who are from non hindi speaking belt. Such section of the population is not able to follow the theme of the speech. My suggestion will be that PM's speech should be dubbed into regional languages and telecast with the same video images immediately after conclusion of his speech in hindi. This will add to the popularity of the PM in the non hindi belt like Tamilnadu.

Announce a program which is employment generating and primarily useful for the jobless especially the young graduates who are still preparing something and struggling with their lives without a job.
The program should go viral like PMs pet project jan dhan yojana.

1 0 Dear Prime Minister,
Medical expenses are becoming unreachable to middle class and poor. Getting treatment from private hospitals are beyond reach for many as charges vary exorbitantly. There should be a regulation so that it helps common man.

1 0 Dear PM,
The pradhan mantra suraksha bhima yojana and the pradhan mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana have been a great tool to provide a sense of social security among the poor section of people.
It is a well known fact that people in India have to spend quite a big amount for health related problems. I request you to kindly consider to introduce an affordable health insurance scheme which includes free hospitalization and reduction in medical related expenses.

0 0 Dear Prime Minister,
This is regarding Toll collection at every booth causing too much inconvenience to all and huge amount of fuel is getting waste. I would suggest that the government can levy one time toll tax (like Excise duty or road tax etc) while buying a new vehicle and all those who bought can pay the one time toll within 6 months time period. Which will really ease the whole system.

0 0 Plant trees in every road corridor. No of vehicles using the roads is increasing exponentially every day. Which means lot of pollution in the air. Plants and trees can help reducing such pollutions.

0 0 Our PM Mr. Modi talked about political DNA of Mr. Nitish Kumar and not of his body DNA which is of no interest to PM or anybody.So why there is so much hue and cry about the DNA.

0 0 Sir,
It's worth considering a change in "Tenancy Act"
In Bangalore( and other IT cities), many Land/House/PG owners demand unjustified amounts as advance. I do not know whether our law permits this but these people ask for whopping 5-10 times of rent as "House Security" and while vacating the house, they deduct "one month rent" as " maintenance".
most of the owners accept ONLY CASH as this all goes as "black money". Could you kindly start a forum/court where these kind of issues can be raised

0 0 Please centralize the RTO's in India. Give us the freedom to drive to any place in India without needing to pay road tax in every places. Citizens must be allowed to pay road tax only once and that must be valid in all the states of India irrespective of the time of stay in that state.

My suggestions are:
1. What safeguards we have in place to ensure that our country does not get into a Greece-like crisis.
2. How are we promoting innovation (in a broad sense) in India to promote growth.
3. Our biggest strength, our population (particularly youth) seems to be migrating to developed countries for a higher quality of life. What are we doing about this?
4. Why are there so many restrictions Indian flag usage? Flag on Sachin Tendulkar's helmet being a case.

0 0 Respected prime minister,
Please help to maintain the dignity of women in our country.the rape cases are increasing at worrisome rate.we are afraid of men.we have lost our freedom,why nothing much is done to tackle this.porn sites are one of the major cause of instant rapes.it is deteriorating our culture and family values and relationships.even prostitution must not be legal in country.strict raids on hotels and such places .prostitution and porn sites have criticaly damaged our culture.

1 0 Sir i would suggest to launch an "e-notarisation" portal in order to enhance the Digital India program and the promotion of online payments for the issuing of notaries.This will make the notarisation process transparent & prevent the corruption induced by the mediators in the same process.
Thank you.

0 0 Election reforms : Persons of national importance waste lot of time in campaign for state elections.In India, there is always an election. Sir, stop this double loss - money and time both (Lets think money is rotated in market for good) but the same time could be given to solving lot of pending problems of our nation. Make state election either midterm(2.5 yr) or at the time of LokSabha election as per need. Bureaucracy can manage states under Governor if President rule is necessary there.

0 0 As the nation is going to celebrate the 69th Independence day, I trust the PM's speech would include how to eradicate poverty,and to make use of the youth power to eradicate poverty. The internal security,where this has become a major aspect to think.

0 0 Respected Prime Minister Sir,
I am very happy that You call people views for your speech on great occasion of 15th August. In my view 1st say those Martyrs of country and their family welfare.
2nd say about NAKSALVAD and how free from this. 3rd say about Physically Disabled Person- a) How can give his /her  service in Government / country development?
b) Welfare of physically disabled  persons - in employment, in Government Service  & his/her preferable posting ( native place).
Namaste Sir.

0 0 Many terrorists from Pakistan are being killed in India and they are quietly buried in India and Pakistan claims that they are not encouraging terrorism.
One solution is to return all the bodies of dead terrorists to their families in Pakistan, then it will be proven that these terrorists are from Pakistan.
A morgue should be built in Wagah, near the border and the bodies can be kept there, until the family members come to claim the bodies.

1 0 Dear Mr.PM,
Government is committed toward boosting our education system as can be seen from large number of education programmes.What it lack is participation from the rural families in getting their child enrolled.Installation of biometric attendance(Digital India)for teachers and students in schools should be made compulsory so that there can be transparency in the implementation  of these programs and also to monitor the efficiency of these programs.Hoping to hear that in your speech.

1 0 participate in all activities of life. 
Some of the differently-abled people are very talented & have done exceedingly well in life. The recent success stories in UPSC CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATION shows their remarkable fighting spirit when it comes to dealing with their disability and succeeding despite all odds, which is celebration and triumph of human spirit. The need of the hour is to welcome them to mainstream of life with more ramps  wheelchairs/Braille system books in public places

1 0 Though a lot has been done by Government & various voluntary organisations for their welfare, there is a long way to go as lot more has to be done. First and foremost, the society’s perception and mindset about differently-abled people needs to change. People & organisations should realise that they are normal human beings and one among us & not discriminate during employment. The employment and vocational avenues for them should be widened & they should be given equal opportunity to participate

1 0 As the nation is going to celebrate the 69th Independence day, I trust the PM's speech would include a statement which would touch the hearts of many differently-abled citizens as
India has one of the largest population of differently-abled people. The census shows that the population of differently-abled people has increased by 22.4% from 2.19 crore in 2001 to 2.68 crore in 2011.

0 0 Sir our solution of all the problems lies in cantrollig the Population.Please think about it.

1 0 Honorable Prime Minister,
I want you to address on the ill-effects of caste based reservation system in our country. Reservation of seats should be for the poor and illiterate class whereas rich people in the cities are abusing this power. The needy people are not getting their rights. Also decreasing seats in gerenal category is a thread to poor people in that category.
Hence, I suggest you to chane from the present "CASTE BASED RESERVATION" to "ECONOMY BASED RESERVATION".

0 0 Hello PM sir, First of all I want to congratulate you for all the initiative you have taken for the betterment of this country.My only suggestion would be to kindly modernize and modify our Police departments. Police in this country are doing excellent job but are most neglected personnel, My only request is to do something to boost their morale both physically and mentally. We need to restore faith back in our internal security dept. I request you on behalf of all of the hard working policeman.

0 0 Sir other than i am very much worry about our teaching system.
teaching system options jada ho gaye hai aur fees bhi bahot jada hoti ja rahi hai ..
next some of years again face problem for low teaching percentage

0 0 Sir, there must be some idea with govt regarding qualified educated people unemployment in India. Eg: In Andhra Pradesh there are lakhs of people studied B Ed, these youth are technically qualified for teaching. But there are no jobs are generating simultaneously. If jobs are not available why they should give new admissions for colleges. In May 10000 jobs are released, exams conducted nearly 5 lakh people written exam. This is huge gap between supply and demand.

0 0 Hon'ble PM Sir,
Most respectfully it is suggested that the movement of  ''give up subsidy'' on domestic LPG Gas Cylinders may be provided with a certificate of appreciation that the person concerned has given up his/her subsidy for the cause of the nation. Sir, it can be highly motivational for a person to get a certificate (may be signed by the worthy yourself /or with a seal impression of the Govt. of India). If it is deemed fit the same may be announced from the Red Fort or later.

0 0 Respected Modiji,
     Bharat got independence 68 years ago, but we are yet to be fully educated of our fundamental rights and basic human rights. we got independence from the british rule, but we are yet to get independence from the conservative caste system, where there is a parallel government functioning in the name of caste. people are in constant fear of the caste panchayat.  please bring some measures to control these caste panchayats.

0 0 sir i am doctor.over last few years no of doctors have increased dramatically ,thanks to private medical college.but have we concerned about quality of doctors we produce.everybody in our country will accept that today agents are doing admission whoever pays.how can we ignore it sir.MAKE EVERY MBBS COLLEGE MANDATORY TO TAKE STUDENT FROM SINGLE ENTRANCE TEST.PRIVATE MEDICAL COLLEGE ARE CONDUCTING EXAM,TAKING MONEY AND GIVING THEM RANK!IS THIS HOW DOCTORS ARE MADE!THINK SIR.address the problem plz

0 0 A National Population Control Rule should be made immidiately which will restrict every couple to have maximum 2 children irrespective of religion. However, the religions(or castes) having very less population can be given some relaxation. Those not obeying the rule should be strictly punished. This rule will enable every citizen to to have sufficient resources like food and jobs.

0 0 Dear PM,
The whole country waits for an urgent initiative from you to solve the country's crushing population problem which is keeping all our development indices at rock bottom. You can declare the next 2 years NO-BABY years on the Independence Day.
You may also mention that endless Reservations are responsible for the wide-spread incompetence and gross mismanagement of resources.

0 0 lets decide that we will not let any more farmers comit suiside ..it makes us hang our head in shame ..they are equivalent to our mother who feed us . PM pl set up mechanism by which without helping the farmers they can survive on their own . today our farmers dont get right price for the crops , becoz of exploitation by the middle man , who make good profit doing very less compared to the farmer . We Indians should learn to respect farmers as we do for doctors and engineers

0 0 Respected sir, the biggest and foremost concern is security of women .Your words means a lot.infuse sense of responsibility in youth.people are more active on social sites than in society.If in case of an EMERGENCY our neighbour  will help usfirst  than a facebook friend sitting 100 kms away.we all are kids of ONE GOD .treat mother ,sister or daughter of others as own.agar hum aaj kisi ki apne 2 hathon se help karenge to agar kabhi hame zaroorat padi then pramaatma 10 hath jaroor bhejega.

0 0 Let me 1st thank you for being the 1st PM to seek suggestions from its citizen.I would like you to talk upon:-
1. Woman Security- Its a generic topic, but I guess its of prime importance. When will our mother,sister and wife's feel secured & safe
2. Infrastructure-For India to be a super-power huge improvement in our infrastructure is needed.There are huge infra projects going on, but still we have potholes & road qualities
3. Our stand on Pakistan & till when will we have to tolerate them

0 0 I really appreciate this move by our respected PM. My suggestion is that whenever there is any disaster or natural calamity like flood and all, why do we always send our army , i think a different force with courage and bravery like that of army should be constituted only for this purpose which will definitely reduce our army's work pressure.

0 0 secondly ,we being an agricultural nation , how can we effort to lose so many of our farmers , who are forced to commit suicide. Dont we have any ways or means of stopping this . In the state like Maharashtra from where Subhash Palekar like people are teaching the world about Zero-Budget-farming ... why is govt. machinery not helping such low-cost techniques to be usedd widely . We are there becoz of these kissan , dont think just by starting a kissan channel we can deal with it

0 0 Respected PM,
Talking on technological point of view we are the largest importer of defence equipments there is also large number of brain drain from our country because of lack of importance to it, we have started some initiatives but technologically our base is not strong we must introduce computer programming and other software developing language in our syllabus. As of now when students byheart it instead of understanding so introducing it will be technically good for our country.

0 0 Dear PM sir,
one of the biggest difference of our nation from others is our judiciary system. But now the days our supreme court  is not accessible propeerly for ordinary people. Everyone around our country cant reach delhi for appeals and other purposes, becouse of this peoples not getting the use of our judiciary.. it would be perfect if there is a regional supreme court bench in each region(like south,west,nort,east)

1 0 you should start by giving an update of tasks that were taken up from last year ..what was accomplished and what were not... and why they were not ..and how to accomplish them. eg. Swach Bharat ..was a great point that you raised ... u also took the broom for once on the street and many followed to be photographed on media. Phir hum bhool gaye ... We need to keep the issue alive till it gets completed . we should benchmark against the developed nations of the world

0 0 Even without publicity people will go for petroleum products. This way we can save money and help poor. This is only one example. This way where ever add is not required, we can stop that and use that money for good things.

0 0 Dear Prime Minister, I want you to tell the people about some moral values as these values are missing in our society.
People have become selfish.They don't care for anyone,anything.They must think about their works and their results on society and nature as well.

2 0 Hi Sir, I have one Idea which i Think will be a great help for our Swacch Bharath Abhiyaan. Sir, D main reason 4 dirty roads & streets is, people don’t find any nearby place to throw their waste / urinate. We need to build Toilets & Waste collection Bins at every 100 mts in every street & residential area. Also include this as MNREGA scheme. People will get job and also our streets will be clean. I am ready to volunteer for my city. No One wants to throw waste on roads. So Plz think on this

2 0 Dear sir, First I would like to thank for giving an opertunity to listen the people of India after winning an election. Secondly I would like to put a question front of you regarding the adds. We r always hearing petroleum companies are in loss and gov helping them to manage their loss. Also noways seeing lot of messages from gov to leave subsidy.An humble request, why this petroleum companies need adds?They r spending crors of rupees for adds, y this can be banned and can utilise this money

0 0 resp. sir emphasis on citizens responsibility, rights & accountability. everyone expect from Gov. But when it comes to them no one contributes.there is lot of sound against you by opposition but people should know the truth because sometimes if a Lie is loudly repeated again & again then it may be taken as truth so beware of this, people expect from you on policy of terrorism, Drugs, Crime control with police behavior, a honest national police bureau & most imp early justice at low cost.

0 0 Dear sir
Today education is  more for employment the curriculum is designed like that,this is limiting the scope of education, for  125 millions of India patents registering are around hundred per year. so more encouragement for researchers are needed in our India.so more emphasis on R & D is needed in all fields for cost effective living and human well being .Introducing scholarship, Schemes providing infrastructure   for encouraging  researchers in the name of great A.P.J.AbdulKalam sir.

0 0 Dear PM,

1 0 Dear PM,  Your Swach Bharat initiative will go a long way in cleaning up cities and villages and inculcate good habits in citizens.
As we march towards becoming a developed nation, we also need a more civilized society. When we leave our homes and walk or drive on streets, we need to recognize that our fellow citizens have a right to space. The rude behavior that is seen in our cities and the highways results in inconvenience and accidents. Your advice to citizens will again be very helpful.

0 0 Improving the daily life of citizens on a continual basis is the biggest proof-point of a working government. In that spirit, govt should pick a list of basic needs and show how those are improving on a regular basis.

4.	Pothole-free roads
5.	Health Care within a radius of 5KM

0 0 Respected Prime Minister sir,
I would like you to take a view over "healthy body , mind and soul", addressing a problem regarding adulteration  of food items,cosmetics, the damage these industries are doing to is a very big concern.

In cities there should also initiate a proper channel to collect Bio-Waste of houses separately so it can use as Bio-Fertilizers after composition
In homes we should use two dustbin
(i) GREEN for Bio-wastage
(ii) Blue or RED for Plastic or Non-Bio-wastage

Sir,i would like to mention few points on which i would request u to put ur attention:
1)reservations in govt jobs-iam not against the reservation provided to the backward classes of our country,but sir they had  alot of fee concession & along with marks concessions too. i think money concession is ok but plz dnt provide marks concession as it will put away many talent out of tht paticular job  & sir plz conform the family background of the paticular candidate.

0 0 Dear sir,
MBBS seats are being filled in private medical colleges mainly on the basis of donations and this a really worrisome trend. The government should make all efforts in bringing out quality doctors and medical seats should be offered only on merit basis and private medical colleges should admit students based on only government selection criteria as it s a matter of human lives.If selection criteria for entry and quality of education is uniform, it can save a lot of lives

Currently the situation of our agricultural sector is not very appreciative in some parts of our country because of the deficient monsoons.In these circumstances Please give confidence to the farmers about the plans of govt. during the times of distress.As recent reports suggest increase in farmer suicides,these words of hope may help them to come out of their pschological trauma.

0 0 It is hurting to know that farmers are committing suicide. I hope you will announce measures to save their life. Loan weaving is not a solution to it. i recommend1) Increase ICAR-KVK with well qualified scientist to help farmers to get proper information of cultivation and for adopting new technology. It will reduce cost of cultivation.2) when farmer harvest their crop and bring it to the market, they will get less price. Make MSP binding on all traders, it should be more than cultivation cost

As we all are going to celebrate the independence day on 15th .Instead of celebrating one day we should organise a 1 week celebrations or at least 3 to 4 days  as independence day week in the whole country,for our beloved motherland "bharat",as i live in rajasthan we celebrate rajasthan divas  which govt celebrates 4 to 5 days organising cultural events & and we also organise nri prawasi bhartiya diwas in the month of january for 2 or 3 days.if we do this for other events why not for our own independence day.
so please kindly ponder over my thought

Recently the age of retirement in government employees has been increased from 60yrs to 65- 70 yrs. Kindly rethink about this decision in view of giving opportunity to the aged to work you are taking away the opportunity of the young and innovative people who are fit in all the ways to work but are not getting employment opportunity just because seniors are not retiring.
Thank you Sir.

1 0 India has one of the largest population of differently-abled people.Though a lot has been done by Govt &voluntary organisations for their welfare, there is a long way to go as 1st & foremost, the society’s perception and mindset has to change.

Recent success stories shows their fighting spirit.need to welcome them with more wheelchairs/ramps/braille books

0 0 there are two major issues facing today.. farmer suicides. parliament non function.
the people who form the basis of the economy are facing so many difficulties because of challenges in agriculture sector.. 
people who are the very top and expected to frame rules/policies are not allowed to work due to dirty politics or rather state of politics in this country.
not only we need reforms in agriculture sector , we also need reforms of politics.
can we speak about this on 15th aug.

Calling ourself Indians and Calling our land India is a travesty. All right thinking people know INDIA and INDIANS is anglicized term of people beyond Indus Valley.

Even today "Bhārat Gaṇarājya" is officially used.
Dear sir, Only you can make the change to call ourself by our 7000 year old heritage identity.

I submit my idea for the Independence Day speech.
"CHEMICAL FREE GRAIN STORAGE REVOLUTION IN INDIA".
India needs inventions especially in grain storage science since around 60 million tonnes of our farmers hard earned grains are stored in government godowns besides seed/grain stored at farm and home.
I am the Indian scientist who made India as one of the world leaders in the above science.

Unemployment is the main issue. Still the case is, poor are still poor, and middle class in middle class, but rich are becoming richest... Studying Higher Education is the main problem for poor or middle class people. which is causing financial barriers so they are not earning much. There is a need to conveptualise the learning from school life and we need to improve education quality from root level to increase boldness in young people so that they can choose their best path.

0 0 although having huge resources India's central-eastern region is not so well developed eg. chhatisgarh, jharkhand, odisha.
as because of capital Delhi the nearby state like Punjab, Haryana, west U.P are all well developed. also because of various sea ports other states get benefited.
why can't we shift our capital from northern India to at least central India.so that every state have equal access to the capital whether it is east west north south. also south India people comes closer to north.

0 0 Sir,
My humble comments are:
1.  Unified civil code
2.  Speedy judiciary
3.  After seeing the way our parliament function, one wonders do we need Lok Sabha & Rajya Sabha, instead of one Lok Sabha. There should be some code of conduct for Parliamentarians.  MP's are making mockery of parliament. They have spoiled the sanctity of the place. Punish them even more severely if they don't obey rules. Otherwise people will lose confidence.

0 0 Respected Sir,
My suggestion as well as request for "One India One Education Plan". The main reason is Today Education has become business in India. Bringing Education Fully Under Government Control can make Education "Corruption Free" and make every Indian Educated.

0 0 Support SWARAJ * Encourage Small & Medium Enterprises * Road side vendors are back-bone of society * Strong and speedy Justice on equal footing * Strong Anti-corruption law and independent enforcement with NO exception. If our India is made corruption free and living cost and conditions will be the best.

0 0 Please declare welfare packages for private employees employed in private institutions. Central and state governments declare revised packages in terms of salary, pension, etc. periodically to benefit government employees as if they are the only people working in and for the country. There is no mechanism to ensure private institutions implement such rules and regulations if any at all. Let us constitute a Pay Commission similar to that of bodies assisting the govts decide financial benefits.

0 0 Dear Sir,with respect to the Independece Day speech, i humbly submit my suggestion of starting the K.A.L.A.M initiative.(Knowledge And Learning to Assist Mankind).It is a multi-disciplinary platform that would serve to bring all innovative ideas and suggestions regarding various fields that will be directly examined by the Union government and suitably referred to the state governments with the end objective of all these innovations being transferred to the most disadvantaged sections.

0 0 Sir, you should call upon for a new revolution. This revolution akin to our freedom struggle should be for freedom from various ills in our society and for new era of development which you have started. It must be emphasized that revolution must come from citizens themselves, the citizens should not only act in a responsible manner but also teach, influence and correct wrong people.
Like for swacch Bharath to be successful we should not only keep clean but also influence others to do so.

Be it the traffic police who ensure smooth traffic flows in the city, or the city police forces who work day in and out to ensure our protection from any kind of untoward incidents. If you could please speak and focus attention of people and governments to this subject of "Police Reforms"

Today may be the African majority of countries are poor and don't have basic thing in place, but sir this is the continent which is bulged with natural resources.

0 0 Sir, 2 years back our well waters were polluted with drainage water. We have won the case against Mangalore City Corporation both at the District Forum and at the State Forum under Consumers Protection Act. Now instead of replacing the defective drainage sytem the Mangalore City Corporation has taken the matter to the National Commission in New Delhi. This is how the corrupt system is fighting against the people. Swatch Bharat has becom a swapna to residents of Mangalore.

1 0 Modi Sir, if we are on growth path we have to take all of us together.
In my view below are the top concerns
1. Education reformation : Now it is a business to open a school,play school, making it popular through activities,dress code,big dignitaries & huge tution fees, where mostly the middle class people are getting suffered. If a person is spending 20% of his income in their kid education, & that too in private organization, where no regulation is there from govt,
Solution :
1. Some regulation should come from govt. to regulate the tution fees, admission fees
2. This is the primary requirements of Indian citizen, can not be & should not be used as a huge money making business
3. Govt should come up with a concept like modernization of Govt school with all the amenity like private school, good teachers, reasonable tution & admission fees & marketing on the same
4. Govt can come up with new age school in all the major city.
We have to take strong decisions to reform this sector. All the major developed countries have excellent education system & that too free with free medical & free medicines. Now Indian citizen are spending more in Education & health because Govt facilities are not near to the benchmark.
Why we can not come up with some solutions. I am sure all the political party will support on this reform.
Let's do it Modi ji.

1 0 Mangalyaan has helped India enter the elite club of nations reaching Mars. This is not enough our next goal should be to establish a presence on Mars. I feel proud that scientists of my nation are capable of taking India to Mars. But do we want to just have a small rendezvous with the red planet? Are we going to be content with being the 5th/6th country in the world to do something significant? Is it not time for us to take the lead in the next frontier--the space? We have to dream big and lead.

0 0 It's time to make a north eastern city as "winter capital" or "digital capital" of India

0 0 It is time we overhaul the education system. We create two types of students: elites who study CBSE and ICSE, state syllabus. All these syllabi must be unified; we should give all our children a quality syllabus in mother tongue. Our system has become so impotent that a laborer in Kerala earns upwards of Rs 650 (for exactly 7 hours work) a day, while a post graduate get Rs 7000 a month. Even a MBBS doctor gets just Rs 10,000 in pvt hospitals! I am sure you will address this issue soon. Thanks

0 0 1.enable heavy donation seat in gov clg for good functioning(5% will be enough for administrative help).
2. accinet case :-helping hand must be considered safest and free emergency treatment to bpl holders
3.give extremist(naxal) a chance to return on independence day (let them begin afresh u will hv less future problem and a peaceful nation)
4.national wide exam for every level for excelent gov eduction facilty for bpl holders.
5.ONE moblie application for registering ALL gov. complains.

0 0 2/2 sports facilities at smaller towns .
6.Remember P V Narshimha Rao as crusader of reforms in India .
7.Significance and importance of Nort East state for us and our importance for them
8.Racist attacks
9.Universal health insurance
10. Job opportunities for youth not in MGNREGA but in real respected areas.

 Main chahta hun ki aap 15.08.15 ko apne bhasan me Sabhi se appeal Karen ki Desh ko aatmnirbhar banana hai to Sabhi ko ane Kuch aawasykta karya BICYCLE se karne chahiye. Yadi har prakar ki gaadi chalane wala kam se kam ek week me 2 din bicycle chalayega to Desh ka aarthik bhala hoga. Iske aur bhi prabhav honge jaise uska apna swasthya thik hoga. Environment par asar hoga aur Cycle udyog se rojgaar badhega.
Aap kahenge to sab pe asar hoga.

0 0 Spirit of TEAM work. "None of us is as strong as all of us." Accountability for MLAs and MPs in building the infrastructure of the nation. If public input grievances it has to allotted a docket number linked to officers/ MLAs / MPs and the status has to be updated in special website so that public can view. A special column to be included to indicate the age of the complaint.

2 0 Modi Sir, if we are on growth path we have to take all of us together.
In my view below are the top concerns
1. Education reformation : Now it is a business to open a school,play school, making it popular through activities,dress code,big dignitaries & huge tution fees, where mostly the middle class people are getting suffered. If a person is spending 20% of his income in their kid education, & that too in private organization, where no regulation is there from govt,
Solution :
1. Some regulation should come from govt. to regulate the tution fees, admission fees
2. This is the primary requirements of Indian citizen, can not be & should not be used as a huge money making business
3. Govt should come up with a concept like modernization of Govt school with all the amenity like private school, good teachers, reasonable tution & admission fees & marketing on the same
4. Govt can come up with new age school in all the major city.
We have to take strong decisions to reform this sector. All the major developed countries have excellent education system & that too free with free medical & free medicines. Now Indian citizen are spending more in Education & health because Govt facilities are not near to the benchmark.
Why we can not come up with some solutions. I am sure all the political party will support on this reform.

0 0 Please announce "Ghao Chalo" movement....make each village self reliant and modern, and create more jobs in villages.....as most of the ex-servicemen live in villages, announce "OROP" and give them more responsibilities in the villages....

1 0 Dear Sir these are my ideas, hope they reach up to you.
1. Education- every one wants to finish his/her higher education in government institute but primary in private schools.You can speak on it.
2. Health of public library , they are highly inadequate and pooly managed especially Delhi Public Library.
3.Pension @ par freedom fighters to those who sacrificed their life during emergency for democracy for us.
4. Contributions of ancient philosophers and scholars like Aryabhatta, Bramhagupta.

0 0 श्रध्येय मोदी जी , सादर प्रणाम ,
आपकी सरकार को एक साल से अधिक हो गया है , घोषणाएं  आपने बहुत की  है पर काम धरातल पर एक भी  जनता  को नहीं दिख रहा है .अब जनता के मन में आपके प्रति नकारात्मक विचार आने लगे हैं . अतः समय रहते कुछ काम करके दिखाएं .
सबसे पहले तो आपकी पार्टी के अंदर मौजूद भ्रष्टाचारियों  को निकाल बाहर करने  का काम करें .खास कर MP में भरे पड़ें है जिसकी जानकारी आपको नहीं हो ऐसे हो नहीं सकता .
अन्यथा आपकी पार्टी का विघटन अवश्यम्भावी है .

0 0 1.I am clg student from tamilnadu.I have read the ragging  cases reported to UGC in last 7 seven years.only 66 FIR. it was far beyond reality. almost all the students are getting ragged by seniors. plz make some announcement on this .This issue is increasing clg droupout. But most of the students are hesitate share this even with thier parents.
2.cut taxes on petrol and diesel.
3.Give education on corruption
4.Announce the national policy on liquor prohibhition

0 0 Please press for law and order is same for everyone. And encourage rewards for those public and police personals who will raise their hand against big name and take action against them for anything that is violating law and order. This will encourage good citizens and discourage atrocious/bad/awful citizens/people. And this is only thing that can help to transform our nation from developing to developed!!
vande mataram..!!

0 0 cont.to last suggestion
4.Give people a day to make public there black money prior to today's date,pay 50% as tax and keep the remaining with you(happy people n economy)
5.Announce no roaming charge within India
6.give sub-cede on green equipment and ask to pan card holders for no sub-cede in lpg(you hv account no)
7.bring temple's property to national property(international economy boost) and use it for developing gurukul system and restoring history n extention research of indian research

0 0 respected sir,
I want to suggest few ideas to you for independence day announcement :-
1.Strengthening the basic education system by conducting a national level exam for panchayt and allowing 5-10 student each to get good gov. eduction facility (not a big deal but a smart step only need to fig out and ensure things).
2.Transferring 2% reservation from whole reservation(not adding any more resevertion) to gov listed beggar n coolies(lower section job)
3.launch police help mobile application

0 0 Sir, there should be a curriculum in school level itself to train the students to fight against corruption in any form.

0 0 Sir, You have to impress upon Indians to take up discipline in their lives. If we have to progress and counted amongst top nation of the world, one very important things is discipline.
Road discipline - Lane driving, minimum use of horns, NO road rage
Business conduct discipline - Attending meetings in time, honouring agreements
Hyegenic discipline - Ensuring that garbage is not disposed off in streets. Under Swach Bharat, why dont you initiate PPP for power generation from urban waste.

0 0 Dear Sir,  Great step in celebrating National Handloom Day. To nourish Handloom industry we should be first users of its products. I request PM to declare a day in week as Handloom day,eg. Wednesday. On this day,  all public sector and Govt employees should wear Handloom dress. This will help in more  buying of products by Indian public and poor farmers and weavers will get benefits out of this. Such steps will enhance   make in India initiative also.

0 0 Respected and dear sir, Namaste. Pl talk about integrated teaching that facilitates Medical Care and Primary Health Approach to ensure Health for All. Basic Education and not stuffing young minds with information is the primary requirement to promote independent and rational thinking that can mitigate 'Bharat Durdasha' (Bharatendu Harischandr.  M S Sridhar, MD(GM);MD(SPM);MD(Psy)

0 1 Dear Sir,
i have enclosed some ideas.

0 0 Namaskaram #PM sir during #IndependenceDay speech you can cover following topics,
1) Second green revolution since farmers are facing huge problems to get loans and crop loss due to drought and floods.
2) Good roads for villages so that every village is linked to towns and cities.
3) Environmental protection and smart city development.
4) Vision 2020.

1 0 Dear Sir
We would like to hear and request you to take initiation and implementation from this I-Day on three things.
1: Next two years roadmap to save our farmers and boost our agriculture.
2: On how we can curb commercialization of education.
3: Boost our Make in India programme by starting Made by India rather than just Made in India.

0 0 Dear Sir,
You may talk on ROAD SAFETY : As we all know that OVER SPEEDING is the TOPMOST contributor in the fatal accidents happening every 4 minutes in INDIA.So,WE have to work towards this .My suggestion would be to LAUNCH LONG TERM PROJECT to install speed sensors on all the crossings in the city and a speed warning signals on all Highways and anybody crossing the limits to be apprehended on real time basis & face severe punishment ,Thanks aL

0 0 Let us celebrate the birthday of Dr.A.P.J.Abdul kalam as the NATIONAL PATRIOTISM DAY As we all know He is a great patriot,besides a great scientist.

0 0 I wish sir, on 15 you should mention child labor & how we can overcome this.

0 0 One of the reasons for poor export performance in Latin America ( despite the apparently high figures half of it is diesel ) of manufactured goods is poor brand perception of India. A brand india fund needs to be set up with corporates contributing 50 percent and government 50 percent to create an umbrella branding campaign for positive stories about Indian business . For instance brazil public does not know +iv experience of Marcopolo making buses in India or  Indian Generics helping Brazil.

0 0 Please look into complaints about 1. corruption 2. non issue of courier licenses 3. misuse thereof.4. harassment in the name of double KYC  for import of letters/ parcels at Mumbai airport and other gateways, Not a good sign for trade and ease of doing business. needs investigation please.

0 0 The present concern is related to the electoral rolls and Voter I'd card.
Most of the present youth are working and studying outside their home state. During the time of elections,we're unable to vote as our name is not there in the electoral list as we were not present in the home state when the officials come to confirm the identity.
We are unable to vote in the migrated state as well as our name is registered in the home state.Please look into this issue as we are unable to contribute.

0 0 Please talk more about tolerance and co-existence in the wonderful Indian society. 
Please talk about growing trees and encourage every Government institution and officials from the ground till the parliament about encouraging growing trees. This should be a serious talk and not another show off event like the "Swachh Bharat" campaign.

0 0 CJI also said that as long as there is judicial independence, the rule of law will be strengthened. The Chief Justice said that judicial independence gives confidence to the people that there is an independent judiciary that will come to their rescue if any wrong is done to them. It is the call of time to make free & fully independent in all respects administratively, financially and judicially all the Judicial and Quasi- judicial functionaries from the clutches of Politicians and Babus

0 0 ESTABLISHING AN IDEAL LOKPAL ( AN ANTI-CORRUPTION OMBUDSMAN ) IN INDIA In pursuance to United Nations Convention against Corruption as also highlighted in Lokpal and Lokayukta Act, 2013 to comply International Standards for ensuring absolute integrity, ethics, values, honesty, transparency and fairness and free from all corrupt practices, favortism and nepotism at all times by all concerned, the very important and vital provisions of this Act to be followed for establishing an ideal Lokpal

0 0 Corruption- free world ESPECIALLY IN INDIA THE IMPUGNED LOKPAL ACT IN THE PRESENT FORM GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED WILL NOT SERVE ANY PURPOSE AS ALL THE TOP FUNCTIONARIES HAVING VESTED AND PERSONAL INTERESTS AND NO TRANSPARENCY EVEN CASE PENDING IN THE INDIAN SUPREME COURT WHERE ONLY RULES HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED BUT THE IMPUGNED ACT HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED BY ANY ONE .THIS SHOWS HOW MUCH PEOPLE ARE VIGILANT AND COMMITTED FOR CORRUPTION FREE SOCIETY ?

ABOVE ALL, THE JUDICIARY HAS TO BE INCLUDED UNDER LOKPAL AND LOKPAL TO BE MADE FOURTH ORGAN OF THE CONSTITUTION FOR ENSURING CORRUPTION-FREE SOCIETY

0 0 THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND GRIEVANCES HANDLING MECHANISM RESULTING LOSING COMPLETE FAITH AND CONFIDENCE BY THE PUBLIC . Recently. Chief Justice of India pointed out in Supreme Court during hearing in case of "TRIBUNALIZATION' as : " WE DO NOT HAVE FREEDOM EVEN TO BUY A PENCIL." IDEALLY,THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF INDIA TO SEND FILES/PAPERS DIRECTLY TO PRESIDENT OF INDIA RATHER TO NETAS AND BABUS , i.e. LAW MINISTRY OR OTHERS AND NOT AT ALL BOUND BY THEIR DIRECTIONS/ INTERFERENCE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION.

Above all, these provisions are against all canons of service jurisprudence, unconstitutional and violating PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL JUSTICE. THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF INDIA ARE REGULARLY EXPRESSING ANGUISH , THE WAY THE BABUS AND POLITICIANS ARE TRYING TO ERODE THE JUDICIARY

0 0 PARLIAMENT PASSED NJAC BILL WITHOUT CONSULING SUPREME COURT AND DELIBERATELY INCLUDED POLITICIANS AND EXECUTIVES IN THE SELECTION COMMITTEE FOR JUDGES EVEN THOUGH THEY DO NOT HAVE A SINGLE DAY EXPERIENCE AS JUDGE These few instances established " SNAKEPIT OF VESTED INTERESTS". and had drastically demoralizing effect on JUDICIAL SYSTEM of the country. as such independence of Judiciary is being eroded further.THE LEGITIMATE RIGHTS OF THE SENIOR JUDGES ARE BEING SNATCHED WHO ARE IN THE LINE

0 0 IS IT FAIR TO APPOINT NON-JUDICIAL PERSONS FOR JUDICIAL BODIES NOT HAVING A SINGLE DAY EXPERIENCE AS JUDGE? Constitutional Crisis is eminent as COLD WAR already started among Judiciary, politicians and Babus due to direct interference in the working of judicial and quasi- judicial functionaries by executive and politicians at all levels even at the highest level of Supreme Court. Advocates are being appointed as JUDGES and four non-judicial members are going to be appointed as members of the LO

0 0 UNCONSTITUTIONAL JUDGES APPOINTMENTS OF ADVOCATES WITH NO EXPERIENCE AS JUDGE. It's true that some of the judicial appointees are advocates but with no experience as judges.

Respected PM.
I fully agree with your campaign of give up LPG subsidy
But it is not connecting to the people as it should be.
Reason is that MPS are taking subsidy on food
Are they poor people? Pls ask all MPS to give up food subsidy in parliament canteen.
This will make your compagin more effective.

Let's allow to children to work to protect their self respect rather than to leave them on the mercy of Social Societies or their respective Govt. If  work in their destiny then nobody can turn down the table because these social agencies can help them only in limited way or just for short of period.

It would be better choice that such children adopted by Industrialists (First Earn & Then Learn System) where they could learn some skill Artisanship. There is no problem to engage them in soft work like Packaging & Handiwork as well as other numerous harmless work in Good Cultural Environment. They can provide them 2 hours daily Coaching Classes by professional faculty...

1 0 Much ado about nothing (NGO's Working Functionalities):
Are NGO's are doing good work here in India? No, they are not sincere to demolish poverty, illiteracy, unemployment etc from the roots, because if all things would be removed from where they will get fund? They are getting more & more funds from Govt. as well as Foreign Aid.

1 0 Prohibited Child Labour (Difference between Developing & Developed Countries)
To find a job in any industry here in India totally impossible at the age of 13, I'd wondered around the firms to getentry in field of Handicrafts, due to compulsion of Govt.'s Labour Law (which strictly prohibited child labour below 18). We are following too much westernization, but we have to see their prosperity too. There is no unemployment, every child has constitutional rights. Plz see the attached file P# 11

0 0 Sir, the need of the hour, is a National Development Alliance, a union of the executive and the people to take this country forward, despite a few ill-advised, impulsive legislators, itinerant laggards & stragglers, who have chosen to queer the pitch. The government should have a trading arm like Singapore's Temasek Holdings for new age development, that can be fast tracked, easier FDI rules & monitored by a special cell in the PMO. This country, with its vast multitudes needs development.

0 0 Provision of rickshaw stand, auto stand and car stand at important crossing of the city, bus station, railway station, temples, and key market locations are essential to avoid encroachments along the side of road and smooth traffic. Lack of this provision creates traffic jam. Encroachment along the side of the road is also a major reason of traffic jam and strict penal action is required to remove it. Even the govt. officers who are supervising road encroachment must be held responsible.

0 0 Police to be strengthened, be made polite, disciplined, and hi-tech and policy should be framed to provide 30% reservation in police for women.	Police force should also be deployed in civil uniform. Status of FIR lodged be made available on-line to complainant. 	 There should be sufficient advertisement to make people aware of law and they should be motivated to inform police about criminal activities and criminals, if any , in their locality.

1 0 Problems of lack of public toilets need to be addressed.
Most people do not use public toilets because of non-maintenance of hygiene.
Wherever public toilets are made, it should be in sufficient numbers so that hygiene may be maintained.It should be made mandatory for all restaurants to have toilet facility.Public toilets should be within reach (i.e. within 500 meter from any point) of everybody in cities.

1 0 3- In our country many states, political parties are only doing vote bank politics skills persons are going out of state to earn money and they are also not able to participate elections.
So my suggestion is, if any citizen who’s having passport they will be able to caste the vote via online voting option and for security purpose we adopt many options. I think by opted this we will increase voting percent by min.15%.

0 0 2- Whatever companies doing business in India they will take hardest entrance or employment exam but needs to give a chance equally to all youth. if 33% marks required to pass then they will also eligible for employment in INDIA but unfortunately all CMM5 level companies set his own criteria of selection which I think it’s challenging the Indian Government Education System if not possible then change the  passing criteria at initial level.

0 0 1- Your government in central so first change required in central whatever joining happen Jan 2015 onwards all employees needs to do 6 month (mandatory army training)  within two years of joining 70% expense bear by employee in next five years by salary deduction (Freedom is not free needs to understand) , it will change our discipline mindset and working culture. If it will successful states will also choose in future.

0 0 Sir, Defense personnel who lose their life protecting Jammu and Kashmir could be differently rewarded... give their kins right to live and work in J&K. Perhaps they may not avail of opportunity but it will be a great gesture from the gov't of J&K.  Perhaps you may not be able to announce this on independence day without concurrence from J&K government. Perhaps they may have to pass that resolution in their assembly. However if you do find merits in suggestion, you will find way to implement.

0 0 100 smart cities was a great idea last year.  How about expanding to 500, even 1000 smart towns? We need to harness the genius of millions of Indians lacking access to  opportunities that urban areas have. I suggest that small towns where more than three highways, whether National or State cross, are taken up first . These towns must develop as agriculture extension , financial , higher education, transport and employment hubs to bring their rural hinterland into the development mainstream.

0 0 Culture and Tourism are integrally linked. Promoting one cannot be done without promoting the other.  Two separate Ministries for these ensure haphazard squandering of National resources. Cultural festivals are planned with babus working without sync. This Independence day, Modiji, please announce merger of these two Ministries over, say , the next three months. This would bring out the synergies of cultural tourism, devising of tourist itineraries with irresistible, unforgettable appeal

Also take serious action on RTO dept.officers who are not giving attention to overloaded vehicles which is major reason of road accident

0 0 This is kannan.k.s from mettur dam.this is regarding how to control plastic items,which are thrown by people.
each and every products used by people should have gift coupons(like 1,2...etc rupees, depending upon the products value)
if customer used there products, they will not thing it's waste and thrown.they will return waste to the shopkeeper and get back money depending upon the gift coupons.
According to my idea,people will not thing it as waste and throw outside.Thisidea help our nation

0 0 Respected Sir, I want to share my views about road accidents happening now a day with increasing graph day by day, which is very serious hurdle in the development of our country. This is due to most of people suffering in these accidents are youth i.e. 18 to 45 years age group. I am working with a multinational company as a Logistics Manager and come across with heavy vehicles movement in my day to day activities. During these activities I come to know that condition of vehicle is very serious.

0 0 respected sir,
there should be a proper and strict criteria for one who is seving our nation as ministers MPs MLAs.

0 0 Respected Prime Minister,
Let me take this opportunity to congratulate you for taking the sincere initiative for helping the poor in our country. By taking your advise we, our family also gave up the gas subsidy for the poor in our nation.
I have a suggestion to include in your Independence day speak to encourage philanthropic activities in our nations, if possible kindly announce some encouraging recognition for those who are in this field.     
Thanks and regards
Vinu N Mangalam

There should be No charges,whatsoever and whosoever,for using any electronic mode for payment of goods and services i.e. to say All transactions thru banks (debit/credit cards, netbanking, etc) should not have any kind of charges/levies.
All sellers/service providers must be given incentives for doing cashless transactions.
This will automatically decrease use of cash resulting direct control on duplicate notes,black money,thefts,cost of printing notes,etc.

0 0 Hello Sir,
Taking right step in the matter of Media control. In India there must be no right to speak in this kind of sensitive matters,without any base or proof. Otherwise one should be punished severely.
India has such a large population and this is right step to prevent any rumor or misconceptions.
Thanks.

2 1 Respected sir,
I'd like to request you to give a speech to make aware the people of the air pollution caused urban cities. In each educated home if there are 4 members in the family, there will be atleast 3 vehicles in that home.1 for the husband,another 1 for the wife and the other for their college going child. If this happens in every home  what will be the condition of the people residing in that city.Because if this reason air pollution is increasing day-to-day only in urban areas.

0 0 Infrastructure is more important factor .It is mirror of nation. If we use plastic waste to make roads. Material is cheap. We are lucky that we have this technique.

1 1 Please urge people to use low beam in City, as well as when they see any incoming vehicle on highway. This will significantly reduce the accident and death in road accidents.
I have seen the impact of Swachh Bharat campaign when our PM leads it from front.

0 0 Respected Prime Minister,
I'd request you to give a speech which ENCOURAGES youths to involve in AGRICULTURAL FIELD. According to the young generation,occupation as a FARMER is considered as LOW-LEVEL occupation. Most of the educated people choose to be a doctor or an engineer or an artist or a scientist,etc. But no one choose to become a FARMER. If this continues,farmers population reduces as time passes.And there will be hardly countable number of farmers in the country.

0 1 Respected Prime minister,
I'd like to suggest you to give speech about our NATIONAL GAME.Because in India if we ask a kid to name the cricket players he may be able to tell all the players,and even international players.But if we ask to name any 1 hockey player there will be no answer.Not only the kid but even if we ask an adult also there will be no answer.So make our citizens aware that our national game is Hockey not cricket.I'm not telling to discourage cricket but to encourage HOCKEY.

0 0 Respected Prime Minister,
In India due to the extensive use of fuels there may be scarcity of fuel in the upcoming years.Hence I kindly request you to encourage and make aware to farmers to grow plants like JATROPHA and HONGE which yields BIO FUEL. As JATROPHA is a hard plant which can grow on any type of soil,under any kind of agro-climatic condition,can easily propogated through seeds or stem cuttings. It grows very fast.Moreover it is not grazed by animals even during the periods of drought.

1 1 Mobile phone technology/internet made revolution in India, This 15th August, every mobile user having internet should download the National Anthem and play the same at fixed time suggested by ministry of information and comm. National Anthem downloading link should be provided to all mobile user.This will create world record that the Indian citizen having cell phone play National Anthem of country at a time.The word have to spread by social media.This can also be done after PM speech on 15th Aug

2) Water conservation and augmentation

0 0 Regulatory Authority: Empower and invest in regulatory authority to make them at par international regulatory authority. e.g. FSSAI should be given more financial support - it's bench mark should be FDA (USA), EFSA (EU).

0 0 FDI: encourage FDI in Quality Auditing system e.g. allow BRC food quality system for food industries, quality assurance in construction and housing, quality in supply chain etc.

0 0 Dear Sir,
State Governments has taken steps officially for ban on the use of plastic bags below 50 to 40 microns but It's rarely implemented except metropolitan cities and shopping malls. If it is strictly followed at all the levels of the society,  it will certainly help to reduce the huge amount of non-degradable waste, making the nation nearly 40% clean and eventually will help to run our clean India campaign more effectively.Request you to appeal our people to stop using plastic bags.

0 0 Road Safety: Implement modern bill as soon as possible to save millions of lives in next 10 years.

0 0 Under  "Learn and Earn" scheme, student work in relevant industry as an “Apprentice” . Industry pays monthly stipend to each attached student as per the Apprentice Act provisions which is enough for the cost of living and education. After work hours, university arrange “Teaching - Learning” using Mobile ready Lectures and practical at study center labs. It will help us to create large skilled workforce with B.Tech degree without any cost to government. It provides free education to all students.

2. No more Reservation: Let's focus on giving free education to all poor (define income slabs). But, getting Job will purely based on skills, talent. It's matter of our country.
3. Kashmir is ours: No PAK flags in J&K. We need action. Not just words.

0 0 #PM, i think, your #IndependenceDay speech should have a practical aspect to it. So as to say, the government and people come together to work with a long term vision. In your last #15thAugust 2014 speech, you said, "log sochte hain is mein mera kya aur agar mera kuch nahi to mujhe kya," i think it's time, you can give a chance to the citizens that they not only have the love for this country during natural disasters and War but also during peace.

1 0 Dear Mr Prime Minister,
Now a days we see the market is flooded with legal as well as illegal Chinese products. I would be great if you can stress on using made in India products along the call we are pitching for Make in India. This will not only save crores of rupees in our own economy but also boost our small scale industry. For example, with the start of the festive season, promoting earthen diyas will not only boost economic condition of our potter community -- Part 1.. contd...

0 0 Dear  Prime-minister Sir, bride burning and Dowry death is one of the major social problems .  often neglected . Even in the 21st century our country is facing this menence in huge number. the number of BURNS cases related to bride burning reported in our country is huge.on the contrary the treatment of burn is very expensive and time consuming. So you can appeal to youth and their parents to stor asking for dowry . like u initiated selfie with dauther. samilar selfie with daughter-in-law.

1 0 You have been able to inspire many in India to wilfully give up subsidy on LPG as they could do without it. On Independence day please urge those people who progressed in life due to the benefits of reservation to wilfully give up reservation for themselves or their family members so that those who are more deserving and needy can take advantage of reservation and move up in life too. This will lead to a more equitable society.You can even consider publicly honouring such exemlary behaviour.

और किसीको नौकरी नहीं मिलती
इन दोनों किस्सों में समस्या यह हे की सही communication नहीं होता।
क्या हम इस comm. gap को दूर नहीं कर सकते?
क्या एक सही com. सिस्टम नहीं बना सकते?

The need of an hour is 'minimum one bank account per household in India'. As, it is prerequisite to initiate 'direct benefit transfer' for all subsidies, food as well as non-food.... Lots of government money is proving as a wastage due to subsidy leakage. On this independence day, please urge our countrymen for this. Like Kerala, all states of India should b 100% financial included. Also, subsidies may b credited in d accounts of female head of the family....

The focus should be "Unemployed and educated youth" either in urban or rural area by imparting skill training (vocational).

So far our governments were giving it only to the kith and kin of their ministers. This should change. Regards Anurag Thengdi

Even though everyone is equal under the law . But in society many people are prosecuted with superstitions and  old beliefs which are outdated in the Modern India . To achieve that we need to end the sc system and recognition by caste. we should once and for all forget the caste system which binds us to the these old ideas.

Most of the educated people choose to be a doctor or an engineer or an artist or a scientist,etc. But no one choose to become a FARMER. If this continues,farmers population reduces as time passes.And there will be hardly countable number of farmers in the country.

It is very struggling for them to pass plus 2 in medical stream and then hope is shattered when huge payment is asked to pay.

There are many navratan companies or public sector companies in india when these companies do their recruitment and selection process they demand for some fees which is mostly more then 500 or 600 for a candidate related to Journal/ OBC (NC) and for SC,ST, FH it is exempted.

They can redeem those points as the exemption in govt PDS stores or govt can offer some facilities in reciprocation.

0 0 Sir, we need to motivate our youth to dedicate their knowledge, service as a part of  developed India. Our goal should be on the vision of India 2020 where every youth has an opportunity for education irrespective of case and creed. Can't we have reservations only for economically weaker section and not based on cast. Why a country of more than billions fails to give unique to the world because our IIT and IIM have exemplary students but their knowledge is used by MNC due to higher pay packages.

1 0 A SIMPLE IDEA FOR SPEECH BUT it wil effect youths of all INDIA...this is the key for making the development of india far far better than it is now ,this can only happen when WE GET FREEDOM FROM RESERVATION ,as it is stopping the way of India becoming a superpower,IF reservation continues to steal our RIGHT TO EQUALITY.than after several year we will become the oppressed classes of society ,THan will u give US RESERVATION

0 0 Every state should develop their own railway tracks for Main Tourist points of the state. It will reduce burden on road traffic and will also increase tourism. States should also develop their own railway tracks for freight services and then Indian govt can use these tracks to transport the freights through shortest possible way and center will pay the states in reciprocation.Secondly, Every State should be given the target of certain crop to be produced according to their climate and soil type.

0 0 On Independence day, I request our honourable PM to give commitment on Judicial Reforms. Where there is no justice in society, there cannot be value to the efforts of the individual. Only a secured citizen can contribute to his best to the society. The way defence system is imperative at national level, individual security is also all the more important at all levels of individual activities.
Be it women security, financial system security, property rights, child rights, senior citizens rights, patent rights and so on, we need to give protection to constitutional rights.
We have plethora of legislations, actually at ground level people do not know their basic rights. But we don't have a system to deliver the intended benefits.
Once justice system is strengthened, all statutes get its teeth to curtail all unlawful acts by unscrupulous people.

0 0 Today I find that all the political parties are busy in distributing free bees for getting  votes & are forgetting the welfare of the country.
They all talk of the rights of people but forget the tell their duties, infact they are afraid of speaking of the duties  of citizen
Time has reached to tell the citizens about their duties & asks them to abide the law of nation.

0 0 I would suggest that PM should deliver his speech on  15th Aug in very soberly manner. He should not criticize anybody through national arena. He should avoid criticizing past governments. He should not cut any jokes which ruins prestige of the PM Post. He should take up very vital issues in his speech. National security should be top most agenda in his speech. He should give more attention in the development of the country instead of vote politics. He should treat equal all as Indian.

0 0 Respected Prime minister,
I'd like to suggest you to give speech about our NATIONAL GAME.Because in India if we ask a kid to name the cricket players he may be able to tell all the players,and even international players.But if we ask to name any 1 hockey player there will be no answer.Not only the kid but even if we ask an adult also there will be no answer.So make our citizens aware that our national game is Hockey not cricket.I'm not telling to discourage cricket but to encourage HOCKEY.

0 0 pls implement manual scavengers act..... to developed India and save Indians

0 0 Respected Prime Minister,
I'd request you to give a speech which ENCOURAGES youths to involve in AGRICULTURAL FIELD. According to the young generation,occupation as a FARMER is considered as LOW-LEVEL occupation. Most of the educated people choose to be a doctor or an engineer or an artist or a scientist,etc. But no one choose to become a FARMER. If this continues,farmers population reduces as time passes.And there will be hardly countable number of farmers in the country.

0 0 Respected Prime Minister,
In India due to the extensive use of fuels there may be scarcity of fuel in the upcoming years.Hence I kindly request you to encourage and make aware to farmers to grow plants like JATROPHA and HONGE which yields BIO FUEL. As JATROPHA is a hard plant which can grow on any type of soil,under any kind of agro-climatic condition,can easily propogated through seeds or stem cuttings. It grows very fast.Moreover it is not grazed by animals even during the periods of drought.

For improving it there should be a DNA test or Thumb impression test for identifying the person that he or she is a citizen of India and from anywhere in country or world may be he or she can vote.

0 0 Dear PM, This is Vipin Pundir from Faridabad. I am raising this concern related to mother land and the damage to the soil fertility which is resulting into lesser crop yield.
#1 - Eucalyptus Tree(safeeda): It soaks all the moisture from deep soil. Generally, Farmer plants this tree on the boundries(4 sides) of his farm to earn some extra money by selling it.

0 0 I thing if some steps are announced towards time frame to all govt services including simplification of land related issues and also simplification of court and police language from urdu to hindi or english. Time frame for all legal cases is also important. Which in any case should not be more than 6 months. As cases in court are pending for years and years.

1 0 My countrymen/women should stop planting it in fertile land/farm land as this is turning the fertile land into barren land. And please have the gov agency(like Krishi Vigyan Kendra) to research to find out the alternate useful tree & ask the country people to plant that useful tree which do not harm the soil fertility and also not affecting the farmers' income. Krishi Vigyan Kendra/farming research agency can suggest some good trees which can be ready for selling in 5 to 10 years.

0 0 You can desubsidize canteen at parliament as all the members may agree this.

1 0 Eucalyptus Tree takes around 12 years to grow as big tree and ready to be sold.
This tree is planted everywhere in india and mostly in West UP and Haryana.
In history, It came from Europe for planting in muddy land. but now it is damaging soil fertility everywhere and decreasing crop yield due to lack of awareness.

वंदे मातरम्।
 स्वतंत्रता दिवस के इस भाषण में आप देश वाशियों को 'वंदे मातरम्' का मंत्र दे।
सभी से आप ये आव्हान करे की फ़ोन पर hello की जगह वंदे मातरम् बोले।
आपस में मिले तो वंदे मातरम् से अभिवादन करे।
 आपसी कामकाजी पत्र व्यव्हार  अदि में भी पत्र की शुरुआत वंदे मातरंम् से करे।
    वंदे  मातरम् सोचने मात्र से ही ह्रदय में देश प्रेम और आपसी भाईचारे का भाव जागृत रहता है।  क्यों ना हम hi  hello जैसे पाश्चात्य संस्कृति को छोड़ भारतीय संस्कृति से जुड़े रहे।

0 0 ९ अगस्त १९४२ को राष्ट्रपिता महात्मा गाँधी ने भारत की प्रगति में बाधक अंग्रेजी सरकार को क्विट इंडिया का आह्वान किया था. क्या स्वतंत्र भारत में नदियों पर बांध निर्माण के बाधक सामाजिक तत्व को हम हठ छोरो का आह्वान आज ९ अगस्त २०१५ को कर सकते हैं ? ऐसा किये बिना हम नदी के जल को सिंचाई जल में तब्दील नहीं कर सकते और उसे लिक्विड गोल्ड में नहीं बदल सकते.
उत्तराखंड में ४५ बाँध निर्माण की पर्यवार्नीय बाधा को दूर करने के लिए भारत सरकार ने सर्वोच्य न्यायालय से अपील की है.
