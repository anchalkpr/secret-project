It is proposed to set up an agency to combat human trafficking in all its manifestations and grabs since it is a crime with involving other crimes and it is felt that we are few steps behind traffickers and need to have a specialized agency manned by all stake holders for monitoring, investigation, rescue and rehabilitation of the victims. Currently, web portal of Anti Human Trafficking -www.stophumantrafficking/mha.nic.in is available in public domain.
The HTPA is proposed to be pro-active agency or collaborative endeavour of all stake holders so that some feasible impact on the menace can be made.
You are invited to give innovative ideas on what shape will this proposed new institution take in terms of structure, composition and area of functioning.
