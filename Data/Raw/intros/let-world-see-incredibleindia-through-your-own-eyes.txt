In his Mann ki Baat broadcast on 27th March 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi requested the people to share pictures and videos from their tours and vacations in different parts of India. In addition, the Prime Minister also requested the people to put in their own words, the lively experiences during these tours. 
This is in the series of #IncredibleIndia campaign that the Prime Minister had discussed during his Mann ki Baat in in May 2015 and which had received an overwhelming response. 
As the PM explained in his latest Mann ki Baat, tourism sector is among the largest employers in the country, benefiting both the rich and poor. Through our pictures and videos, and by posting our experiences, we would inspire more and more people to visit these different parts of the country, thereby adding further vitality to the tourism sector. As we get to know each other better, we would also strengthen our bonds as a nation.
This Open Forum has been created to enable citizens to post their experiences along with their pictures and videos of their tours. Many of these  posts will be shared by MyGov for wider dissemination. 
In the end, MyGov will bring out an eBook highlighting the best posts.
