Misleading advertisements, tricks gullible consumer in purchasing the products and services which are often health hazards or substandard in quality, for example – various pills/food supplements, fairness creams, etc.  The Department of Consumer Affairs, Government of India having its office at New Delhi, would not be able to check the menace of misleading advertisement without the active participation and help from the State Governments, local self-Governments and the Police department of the States. These authorities are expected to intensify their action against the misleading advertisements as also the misleading advertisers on their own or once altered by the voluntary consumer organizations.

Suggestions are invited on how the State Govt., local self-government and Police can take effective measures against Misleading Advertisements.
