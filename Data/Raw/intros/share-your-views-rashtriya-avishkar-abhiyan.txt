The Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) launched the Rashtriya Avishkar Abhiyan on 09.07.2015.  Late Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam (former President of India) presided over the function.  The thrust of the Abhiyan is to provide support and a platform for schools to make Science, Mathematics and Technology exciting for children and encourage them to develop a natural curiosity interest and love towards learning Science and Mathematics, literally to “ignite their minds”.
One of the key highlights of the Abhiyan is the ‘Mentoring’ of schools and children through ‘Mentoring Institutions’ like IITs, NITs, Central Institutions, IISERs and Central State Universities and Colleges. Under the Abhiyan, the MHRD is also collaborating with Google in its ‘Code to Learn’ Contest where school students will be encouraged to develop Code using innovative software.  Similarly, the Ministry is partnering with Intel for developing innovative technological capacities in girl students in Government schools.  
In the first three years of the Abhiyan, it is expected that 25% of all Government schools will be covered by the ‘Mentoring Institutions’ through various activities and innovative strategies in partnership with the Department of Higher Education.  
The Ministry invites ideas and suggestions from people on how the Abhiyan may creatively involve individuals to join the movement and to work directly work with school and school children to "ignite their minds".
