On 15th August every year, the Prime Minister speaks from the ramparts of the Red Fort and lays out the government's programmes and policies. This year however, for the first time in history of Independent India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as he mentioned in his Mann ki Baat on 26th July 2015, is directly seeking ideas and suggestions from citizens on what he should speak in this year's Independence Day Speech.
So now you have the opportunity to tell your ideas, give word to your suggestions and crystallize your vision. Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself will articulate them.
