CURRENT ROLE AND FUNCTION OF DGS&D
Directorate General of Supplies & Disposals (DGS&D) is a Central Purchase and Quality Assurance Organization of Government of India and presently rendering procurement services to Government by concluding Rate Contracts (RC) for common user items.  RC is an agreement between the Government buyer and the supplier to supply stores at specified prices during the period covered by the Contract.  Based on the RCs finalized by DGS&D, Central Government Departments across the country place supply orders.
ENVISIONED ROLE OF DGS&D
Government intends to bring more transparency, efficiency and ease of procuring a large number of commodity items required by Government departments and organizations. DGS&D will create a new e-procurement system by offering an online one-stop market place, a government-to-suppliers portal encompassing the entire procurement process.  This will help Government buyers save time, reduce administrative costs and ensure low pricing for various commodity items and services which are bought regularly and have common specifications.  Through innovative measures speedy online payment mechanism will be worked out.
