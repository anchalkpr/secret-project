To celebrate the spirit of Surajya, on the occasion of Good Governance Day, MyGov is organising an open forum discussion where citizens are encouraged to contribute their experiences of success stories in government schemes during the year, improvements that can be made in existing programs and suggestions to the government  for the next year.
These contributions by citizens would be compiled and presented as a comprehensive report to the government for consideration.
Citizens are encouraged to use the hashtag #Surajya in each of the posts that they make on the forum and then share the same on on either Facebook or Twitter. @MyGovIndia Twitter handle would RT some of the innovative posts that citizens make on MyGov and then share on Twitter. 
As a special initiative, Twitter timeline has been integrated in this forum and all posts with hash tag #Surajya and posts from @MyGovIndia Twitter handle would be visible on Twitter timelines integrated in the left column of the open forum. 
The Open forum discussion would open at 10:00 AM on 25th December and close at 10:00 PM on the same day.
