Prime Minister's Independence Day Speech is perhaps the most important speech of the year. It carries it with the import of history and the vision and aspirations of future. Delivered every year on 15th August, from the ramparts of the Red Fort, the Independence Day Speech is the occasion when the Prime Minister lays out the government's achievements till date and the and the programmes and policies for the future.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has however, for the first time,  set the trend of directly seeking ideas and suggestions from citizens for formulating his Independence Day Speech. Like last year, this year too the Prime Minister invites citizens to contribute their views, their ideas, their suggestions, indeed their own vision.
So now you have the opportunity to tell your ideas, give word to your suggestions and crystallise your vision. Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself will articulate them.
