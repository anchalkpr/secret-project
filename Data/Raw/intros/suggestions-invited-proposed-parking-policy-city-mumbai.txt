The vibrant city of Mumbai, home to over 12 Million people, is the financial capital of the country. In order to improve the quality of life, Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) wishes to improve the basic infrastructure.The city has seen a significant increase in the private vehicles over last few years. It has become increasingly difficult for citizens to find public parking places while they are on the move. In order to ease the parking woes of the citizens, MCGM proposes to adopt and implement a new parking policy. The new parking policy elaborates on-street parking (residential parking, parking near schools, and parking for tourist places) and off-street parking. Moreover, MCGM also envisages web based parking to be implemented and issue receipts using hand held devices.
As a pilot project, it is proposed to implement the parking policy in ‘A’ ward after receiving the necessary approvals.
Suggestions are invited from the public at large for improvement of the proposed policy.
