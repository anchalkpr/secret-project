The Prime Minister may retweet and share many of these voluntary #StatueCleaning contributions from his social media profiles.
During his Mann ki Baat on 27th December 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggested that we utilise the occasion of Republic Day to reacquaint ourselves with our national heroes by voluntarily cleaning their statues and the accompanying premises.
Citizens have actively taken up this suggestion and have converted it into a #StatueCleaning week beginning from 23rd January 2016, the birth anniversary of revolutionary freedom fighter Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. On 26th January we celebrated our 67th Republic Day and remembered the contribution of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the architect of our Constitution. This way, during that week, it became not only an opportunity to acquaint ourselves again with the lives of these great Indians, but also to pay our homage to many other of our national heroes, by cleaning their statutes and spreading awareness about their work. 
Now, on 14th April, we celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. It will again be an opportunity to pay homage to the Father of our Constitution and acquaint ourselves with his works and teachings.

On this forum, creators of #StatueCleaning events and volunteers taking part in these events can upload the pictures of their activities using the hashtag #StatueCleaning. These contributions can then also be shared on Twitter and Facebook.
