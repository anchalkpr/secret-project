In December 2014 the United Nations declared 21st June as ‘International Day of Yoga’ after 177 nations across all continents of the world co-sponsored a resolution seeking the same. 
When the resolution was adopted, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed immense joy on this and said that Yoga has the power to bring the entire humankind together. It may be recalled that the Prime Minister had mooted such an idea during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2014.
You are requested to provide inputs on the following aspects relating to the marking of the first ever ‘International Day of Yoga’.
(1) How can the ‘International Day of Yoga’ be celebrated at the UN forum?
(2) Suggest creative ways in which the ‘International Day of Yoga’ can be celebrated at the world stage.
(3) What are ways in which we can mark the ‘International Day of Yoga’ across the length and breadth of India?
Best inputs and suggestions would be sent to the Prime Minister himself and would also be utilized.
