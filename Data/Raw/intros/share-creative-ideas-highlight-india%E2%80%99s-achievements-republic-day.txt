26th January is a day etched in the rich and glorious history of India.
MyGov invites all the volunteers of the MyGov family to suggest designs as well as themes that can be used by the Government of India to highlight the extent of work that has been done in the last few months. This messaging can vary from one zone to the other (example- different messaging for the North, South, Northeast etc.), thus enabling dissemination of zone-specific information.
Kindly, also share innovative ideas like creative videos, attractive e-posters, Whats App messages, catchy radio jingles on the above themes.
Let us make this Republic Day messaging more impactful and innovative so that it leaves a lasting impression of the celebrations of this momentous day and encourages all Indians to rededicate themselves to the cause of nation-building. 
The best inputs will be shared with the Government of India and would be acknowledged by the Prime Minister.
