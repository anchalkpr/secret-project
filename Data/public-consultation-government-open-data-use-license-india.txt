19 2 I would like to bring to your notice that a lot of current data is available in PDF format example - http://posoco.in/DailyReports.aspx Such data is useless / very difficult to use for analysis. All data should be available via APIs and as CSVs that can be inputted to a computer using automated tasks and crunched with minimal efforts. Human time is too valuable to redo work that someone else has already done.

0 0 There must be system for sharing Govt. data. It is very much required for research, academics and industry. 
0 0 I aappreciate this excellent initiative. The system will definitely help the researchers. At the same time I feel that there should be a clause to prevent abuse of the data. Though the types of data have been defined the forms in which data would be available like xml, pdf, excel etc. also may be defined. 
0 0 The present system of pensions to all Members of parliament who completes a term of 5/6 years is not justified..due to the present political system in India this is going to create a huge burden to the exchequer and above all it can be extended to the very few poor members if any..pl think about it..In my view,even 5% of the retired M.Ps doesnt require pension atall. 
0 0 Please find my consolidated comments in the attached PDF file.

0 0 Very good initiative by govt. Of India. 
0 0 This should accessible to each and every citizen of the country whether it is licensed. This should contains all departments data except security to the nations. This should specifically having the economic welfare data and statistics from the year 1947 in comparative forms. This should have authenticity through the link of AAdhaar Number to all citizens. 
0 0 Great thinking for it .. nice plan taking by Gov 
0 0 Nice idea is this. It is useful for all to know all types of areas very well . As a common man should need a open clarification regarding this through well known publications and explanations for remove unwanted objections. All of our govt. decision were supported by majority but for making some political drama the news coming in wrong way. Like Mahatma Gandhi said "Development should start from villages".Because , Common man can do Extra Ordinary Things. Best wishes. 
0 0 All suggestions in the attached file. Newly proposed clauses attempt to introduce a creative commons licensing model 
0 0 Nice Initiative. Transparency should maintain. 
0 0 A good initiative by Government. However, it is suggested that everyone shouldn't get same access to every information. First there should be proper way to authenticate user. Secondly there should be 4/5 different category. The critical information for Defense and Security like services should be restricted to relevant persons only. The information regarding research may be accessible but limited to concern about security for establishments such as DRDO and ISRO. 
0 0 I mean to say that when people pay nos of Tax, politician receive big salary & extra benefits, then after why do not progress. 
1 0 First of all to stop corruption, it should be start from the top means corrupted Politician, Govt. top level officer etc. No one can see the people's hurdles, problems after election. Before election they reach at door to door for vote & give commitment for better future of areas. But...... and of the election & selection, politician did not fulfill any one commitment from the wild list. 
0 0 data.gov.in is not accessible. It is down at this momemt. 
0 0 It will definitely increase awareness, bring transparency & guide us for our future plans. Many times many things go un-noticed, open-ness helps avoid mistakes & mishaps. We want a better tomorrow specially for our younger generation so 'All The Best' to the team & may the project start at the earliest; with minimum mistakes & maximum achievements. AMEN. 
1 0 A 4level access based on weighment of security significance:The highest level of information of defense, commerce, weather should always be restricted.3rd level data can be accessed by researcher,policy makers after reviewing the request by the applicant;2nd level by subject specialist, journalist in a specific room made available in state administrative office through verification of Adhar with image scanning;1st level by amateurs,public through portal entry verification by Adhar no. & OTP.

0 0 I saw some of the charts on mydata.gov.in which shows the visualizations of how some of this information is really wonderful. What we are looking for is a Gov 360 dashboard which shows the progress on different sectors, by state, by city, by mandal, by panchayat. Take simple example of swach bharat, how much is collected at each level and how much is spent within the same month/year. I hope Modi and team will together put forward a dashboard which is more recent than previous year. 
0 0 Step  is impressive but which step do you have to give good  connections  of internet and electricity sir.. and what is the  solution of hackers and other unaccomplished  activities ? And  first is the knowledge of handling computer and internate is not  given in rural areas since today  many of peoples  having no idea about that... 
0 0 Great!! facility to provide data in required format should be made available. Purpose of getting data should also be taken while downloading data. Encouragement for use of such data for betterment of society will certainly increase the awareness in the public or users. J P Jain 
0 0 excellant idea to make system impartial 
0 0 It's a progressive step but it must be insured that data once available in open can be easily accessed so server should be made to handle good amount of traffic and also information sharing should be linked to aadhar number so that person taking data should be made accountable for any mishandling of data leading to damage to nation's image or causing misunderstanding among masses. This will also promote aadhar card among masses 
0 0 A great initiative by the GoI. This will bring sea change in the ploicies and governance as a whole. 
0 0 Great Idea. Data should be accessible to public. But some mechanism to filter those who access data will help to avoid misuse of open data. 
0 0 when our country will give  special respect to the ARMY , NAVY, AIR FORCE officers Jawans &  all  other staffs . Those  who  are  sacrificing  there  life  for  our country  Why  Hanumanthappa  is  not  regarded  by  every  Indian . 
0 0 There are two debacle to this free data use. One it is not seamless two The two types of Connectivity one is mobile and another Laptop for both though there is a validation process, that validation is not an authentic, as the system of registering for mobile use or Laptop use is not vouched properly, as the given information are only at the consumer end and it is not validated and authenticated in many case with the Concerned Registry. 
0 0 Excellent effort for the first time in the history of India government has given the option to participate and consult public.Please try to bring in transparency in all sectors. 
0 0 IT IS A AMAZING THEN AFTER THE FREE DATA PEOPLE NEVER FORGET THE MODI GOVERNMENT 
0 0 All the beneficiaries of Govt Schemes should be made public. Also please bring in political parties funding details to be made public. 
0 0 #OGD, As per our opinion following sensitive sectors are in need of transparency: Agriculture, News Media, Medical and Pharma, FDI, Defence, Law and Justice,  Archaeological, Policy, Environment and Renewable energy, Trading and commodity, Construction, Employment. 
0 0 #OpenDataLicence First Step Towards Progress in any democratic country is "Transparency". With freedom comes from transparency. Stepping stone of faith and confidence is again transparency. Its great initiative by our Hon'ble Prime Minister. "Government Open Data Use License" will boost-up the strength of common man and give platform to have enough or sufficient Data access to any institutions/sectors/ministries/departments for expansion of access for individual and collective growth of socity 
0 0 #Clause4 No warranty - This clause gives a protection to the data provider but it creates a liability for the user. Onus should lies on the publisher or provider of the data. This will restrict the usage of the data to spread across masses. #Violation - If there is a possibility that data usage causes violation of law, it is the responsibility of the provider to ensure the correctness before publishing it. #Perpetuity - This should not be a condition. #Citation should be mandatory for all data 
0 0 Any data that is in Public domain  should ensure data privacy issues. Beyond that, the provider needs to supply the potential applicability and tagging. While the data consumer might use it for various purpose they need to reference all the uses. There has to be public round tables to be encouraged by Govt and organization to show case how data is used that helps govt to better their data sets and understands the practicality of data. 
0 0 In section 4 clause d warranty In my opinion the Data must be an authenticate one and liability should be upon the data supplier. If we did not impose liability then many wrong data may be come up which lead to many confusion. My next suggestions is if the data is in digital format then it should not be open we much restrict with username and password. As all the citizens have their Aadhaar No. username should be his Aadhaar No. And password should be his or her date of birth. 
0 0 #OpenDataLicenceIndia, #OGDLicenceIndia, #OpenDataLicence...data are veru sensitive things for Indians, if not handles properly, this can backfire. To avoid this, better to protect all personal and confidential data with digital signature similar to Aadhar and link them. 
0 0 This is a great initiative.My doubts/suggestions are - #Clause2:f-the use of "corporate or incorporate" needs some clarity. #Clause2:is there a way to identify dataprovider and licensor?. If yes how to who obtain a license as this is open data use?. Medical advice of all sorts in form of documents should be avoided,as it's dignosis dependent. Regards, Sekhar Mishra 
0 0 Open data will prove helpful to the masses in understanding the working of the government and the national policies putforth by the government but only if it is controlled by a few senior level govt. officials. 
0 0 #DataCollection I would also like to point out a major issue in data collection and data entry in our country, which is wrong entry of data in id-proof ( be it voterCard or any other doc). I request the government or the concerned authority to develop a similar data collection center for public records,i.e, government identity proof, imposing a strict senior level govt officer access to this data. This would lead to easy verification of such data and a combined and efficient working. 
0 0 #3#4 Please include data related to national policies. This will help in understanding of government policies by the public in a better way as they would have full access to the drafted policy 
0 0 Verification should be more transparent and easy, it should be accessible to Indian users and may be linked to Aadhar number. 
0 0 While the thought and intent behind sharing the data seems to be good, it is frought with risk of personal data being mis-used for commercial purposes creating tons of problems for the individual whose data is being shared. Care should be taken on following front 1) Personally identifiable data (name, phone number, pan number, aadhar number, address, etc.) should not be shared. 2) People / companies accessing the data should declare the purpose for data is being licensed and Govt. should ensur 
0 0 #OpenDataLicense 
0 0 #OpenDataLicenceIndia... Growth comes from Transparency. Data has to be provided on request for Analysts. But unauthorized usage may determine/undermine our growth potential. Our small mistakes in Data interpretation will cost as much as big. We have to provide the data through authorized and for proper usage. Water marking/Digital Signature & Data has to be password protected and linked to Government data log servers if it is used anonymously. 
0 0 This is the great Idea. This will give transperency to everyone. 
0 0 It is a good idea. Government should make the data available to public regarding various schemes such as swachha Bharat,swachha vidhyalay 2016 progress on adoption of villages by sarpanch panch /parsad ward members make in india .Also the cases of corruptions caught and punishment to the concerned, black money recovered etc. The government may also collect the information processed and documents developed out of the data provided. That clause can be added as part of terms and conditions. 
0 0 1)This is a grt idea..bt person using this data should be verified as well as the cause 2)All transaction related to government policies and Thomas should be listed 
0 0 #[1/1] This is an great initiation and it will give good results in future, but the information shared by the government should be right and it should include all investments made by any government yojna and who has undertaken it , what's the total cost they have spend in this yojna . How much money given to farmers and how much they actually got etc  i.e. people need every information to be clear and should be correct . 
0 0 [2/2] The data of funding  and spending by each MP / MLA should be available in machine readable form (API) also so that if some person / company wish to build website/APP to simplify the public access to such data, they should be able to do. This is very important for growth of India, as right now we do not know how much our representative receive from stae/central government, weather they use it at all,or where do they use it. This will also highlight what kind of work the representative doing 
0 0 [1/2] The funding and spending of money by each MP/MLA should also be made part of open data. There should be a provision of publishing spending by each MP/MLA for each financial year. They should be mandated to publish data in a format similar to companies publish their accounting (CashFlow, Account Statement etc.) so that public can see where their hard earned money is spent. This will bring transparency and accountability. Continued ... 
0 0 Great initiative! However, the procedure for application for a license to use the data is missing. The licensing procedure should be smooth and fast. However, there may be concerns about who is using and what is the use. I would suggest, there can be gradation of licensing procedure depending on the type of user and type of use. The government may also collect the information processed and documents developed out of the data provided. That clause can be added as part of terms and conditions. 
0 0 Good ideas.mak india . 
0 0 It is a good idea. Government should make the data available to public regarding various schemes such as swachha Bharat, progress on adoption of villages by MPs, Make in India etc. Also the cases of corruptions caught and punishment to the concerned, black money recovered etc. on atleast quarterly basis. 
0 0 it is very much required as this will control some corruption & will increase accountability 
1 0 #Clause7: Sounds like I will have to deal with a government department (submit forms, KYC, wait for approval) to get access to data. If so, it will lead to another license raj. Model data access examples are USGS[1], Helsinki transport data[2]. Unless really needed, the government should not get into the business of putting the data behind APIs. It should be available as a zip file and leave it to business to create an API. [1] http://data.usgs.gov/datacatalog/ [2] http://dev.hsl.fi/ 
1 0 #Clause6a: I'm hoping that there will be scrubbing of the data to remove anything that will identify individuals *before* the data is published. 
3 0 #Clause4f: Not guaranteeing continuity of data will ensure that businesses won't want  to take risks with the data. Some data only needs to be released say once every few years, but other data needs to be updated in realtime. For example, if BEST starts new buses in Mumbai, there is no use if that data isn't available in a timely manner. So, IMO, various departments should do an assessment and come up with data-update frequency that it can manage and state that clearly. #OpenDataLicence 
1 0 - Public data should be available in open format (e.g. plain text, odf, json) via publicly accessible APIs and under Open license. - There should be no restriction in usage of the data for legitimate purposes - Accessing such open/public data should be exempt from bandwidth usage charges levied by telcos so that public can access the data without barriers - Modes to access this data should be well advertised across various media - Measures should be taken to safeguard private data 
0 0 Time to press BSNL to increase internet speed.Their minimum speed is 512 kbps but to bring digital revolution we need 10 Mbps at Rs 100 per month.Also bring WiFi router at Rs 500 with 1000 users connectivity.So all tea shops,offices will provide free WiFi services,which is vital for digital revolution. BSNL has already covered entire country with fiber optic so it does not cost any amount to utilize them efficiently.Unless they reduce fare & increase speed digital revolution will be only a dream 
0 0 I agree with your views,But it must include all businessmens traders corporates also... 
0 0 The draft looks good as long as #Clause6: Personal information should not be used, collected from any of the gov network website. 
0 0 I don't agree with the idea of bringing all data of citizens under a single platform. We have serious apprehensions about the security of the data. 
1 0 I am a Data Scientist based in US. Thank You for making this data public. It would be really helpful if the related data are tagged with a common keyword. For example, I am interested in government school funding, and any information related to these schools - like teacher salary, student grades, etc. If these data points are tagged - it would be easy to lookup 
0 0 kindly read and think upon my suggestions.i think a positive response from you. 
1 0 I have suggestion which is not possible to explain in just 500 characters. But I am sure this may help to improve Public Services without harassment of paper submission and will also improve National security. Govt should include all data of a citizen from birth to death on a highly secured server which will be accessible for verification to all govt offices and schools and colleges and registered companies with respective limitations. This system will take 2-3 yrs to established. 
0 0 An alternative route for the Amaranth Yatra is present via Kishtwar and Warwan valley. why is not government developing and using this route for Amarnath Yatra? a single lane road is already present there and whole valley is much more beautiful than Kashmir valley but it need updation and some other infrastructure development. Via this route anyone don't need to go through Kashmir valley full of radical people.it is much more safer a road is in very good condition. 
0 0 #clause12 Although open data it should be adequately encrypted using public key encryption. Generator of data set should anonymise not required data, information which is irrelevant and sensitive in Nature. #clause12 Master data and OLAP data set should be hosted on different servers so that master data is not compromised. #clause5 A comprehensive list should be generated for all Central, state and local bodies which will share data. 
0 0 #clause2.5 #clause7 With data set Citizens of India should not be identifiable under any circumstances or with help of race religion, caste,  ethnicity or bio metric or it's gross location #clause7 There must be adequate SOPs in to report identifiable information of a citizen of India.If such information is seen by consumer or generator of data it should be reported in specificed time frame or else consumer and generator should be prosecuted with jail term and strict fines. #clause7 
2 0 A Humble suggestion for our national agenda of Digital India 
0 0 it will be great if it includes field related to political/politician/gazetted-officers/VIP'S/VVIP'S 
0 0 Like all developed countries there should be accountability of the Government officer.For instance a construction permit should after careful thought provide building permission in haphazard manner without adequate infrastructure like narrow roads lead to Traffic jams. Entry & exit planning needs a very serious thought it's completely missing as there are no experts used in the process. Similarly any building or area not receiving water, tanker cost should be borne by area officer. 
0 0 Open Date Use License conforming with the RTI Act is good enough for a smoother democracy and a good idea. I appreciate the government taking the initiative and asking for suggestions in the first place, hope the endeavour succeeds. 
0 0 As a student i was trying to make a app for smart cities that would be a platform for many information at a place. I had a firm belief that it would be much helpful in going on digital india plan, but during that i got many difficulties going many office  of government and requesting them to give data to us. At final it was very rare that we got information. I want this law to br framed as no one faces such problem in future. Data should be open for all so that we can create useful product 
0 0 Dear Sir, Can we setup standard process to create road length, size of speed breaker depending on the area of the country? Also there should be centralized process to log all the road construction info so that there will be clear visibility of how long the road are good without cracks. Regards, NNK 
0 0 I want digital India. All the records of all files should be seen by the benefisicries 
0 0 Sir, I have only one sentence to say that for bright future of our contry make strong and capable to our young generation on the basis of inteligency only. and for that collect proper and perfact data to achive target. I am sure only this step can change your dream to reality. 
0 0 Sir, I have somany thinkg to say and I agree that whichever steps are taken are really best but at the time of implimantation majority have been fail to provide expected result. why this is the main question to think. I have seen so many things which result are negative. Here I have thought about "Reservation" Please don't provide it on the basis of cast.Please provide required facilities to students who are really intelactual and who are really in need and expecting support for strong India. 
0 0 This initiative will bring citizens close to the goverment data and maintain their personal data thru e-governance. Reduce manual intervention and corruption. Fast solution will be attained in getting Government approvals and schemes. 
0 0 I think this will help modern india. As we all know how we are witnessing digital revolution, so this RTI is important and #OGDIndia will be goodfor our country. 
0 0 Under digital India Initiative, Open Government Data Platform is endeavoring share of Government data in open domain,that's an brilliant Idea but Are we all fully understand the meaning of data privacy, data protection, and surveillance laws on national and international level? Train every one on this as we are lacking in this , if you open Govt. data that will be National disaster like situation, here every is doing software licence or copy right violation in any form direct or indirect way. 
0 0 हाँ कोई भी अच्छी योजना जो मोदी सरकार चला रही है, मैं उसका सपोर्ट करता हूँ । 
0 0 This is a Gr8 initiative from our dear Prime Minister, Narendra Modi Ji. It complements RTI Act & will strengthen the RTI Act, at least by 100 times; provided all the Govt Depts & its Allies are mandated to upload their day 2 day Data, on this Platform. Special Focus should be on Issues that are the popular Need of RTI Activists. e.g Annual Budget of Central & all State Govts and the Institutions controlled by the Govt.

0 0 Our income tax officials is really ? Every government servant paid their Incometax in salary deduction, through TDS. It is legal. Deductive authorities is responsible for the amount to credit their individual pan number. And form 16. Many more officer in India won't worry about the amount. They simply paid the TAN accounts. Income tax department didn't clarify the tan amount. The common government servant can't do anything in tan amount or form 16 preparation. Please clarify tan amount and deduc

I just wanted to ask why are we tolerating people who are involving in anti national movements and what actions is the government will take to stop such jerks. Also we see that people from dynasty politics or rich can enter politics, how can educated people like us enter and make a mark in politics who wants to serve the people

0 0 Respected Sir/Madam, THIS IS SPOUSE CASE and under Assam Telecom Circle BSNL, BSNL CORPORATE OFFICE LETTER NO.5-21/2009-Pers.IV Dated at 13/02/2009. 
0 0 #1.It is useful for everyone and it is a great idea.But sometimes it may be misused. 
0 0 #9 in National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy should be added related to time. after the occurrence of event how much time max can data provided hold the data before bringing it to "Open data platform". Here we should try to directly link the data from government office computer to open source also mentioning the punch date and time. (this will not only reduce the delay time but also remove the redundancy of work by reentering the data in open data platform. 
0 0 Res. PM Sir, I am so happy to say that, I was give up LPG subsidy on your appeal. I am belong with general cast,tax payer & I am working in private sector.Govt should remove the cast wise reservation & help to poor people for his study & food. Govt.should stop the free service like water, light & etc. Only around 4% tax payer in India. Govt. should implement the system for income tax on rich farmers.Suppose one farmer is 10 acre land & one is 500 acre land. Both are tax free.What is this. 
0 0 Res. PM Sir, Currency of Rs.1000,500,100 & 50 should be banned in the country. With this implementation, we can minimize the corruption,  control the black money generation, control the theft case &b etc. Govt. should circulate the letter for all the currencies to deposit in the bank account without exchange offer from bank with in limited days. Govt. should give some benefit in tax saving on the credit card & debit card transaction. Govt. should remove ST on credit card payment. 
0 0 Respected Shri. Narendra Modi Ji, Aadhar card, Voter card, Driving licence, Ration card making should be online with bio metric system in PPP model. like passport making system. With this implementation, we can minimize the corruption, control the fake card, increase the perfection in driving skill. This is the part of Digital India & PPP model. Govt. can implement to this process with PPP model. I think today's public ready to pay for better service. payment should be online. 
0 0 #GovernmentOpenDataUseLIcenseIndia, I, do not understand this 6th pillar and its contents, nor do I know the previous five? Anyhow, this sounds like "FREE INTERNET" started by MZ and now it is being introduced by our Bharat government itself and with laws which will enable charges (cost) to the private sector. To me it is just another revenue generating process.

0 0 Good step for digital india 
0 0 माननीय माेदी जी का अाभ्ार 
0 1 Giving open data is good but will be better if we give problem and possible solutions related to that topic on which data is being give. For example: data on open deification and, solution, how pubic should help. Thank you 
1 0 It will be one of the great step for digital India. Open data format should be in json format that can be read from any devices. I think every thing should be open and can be done online. 
0 1 Please focus on fddi degree issue and give valid degree to students,we are waiting for more than one year but yet no problem solved. How can a government institute play with our future 
0 1 hello sir,i want to suggest to make a development and working app of our elected member who update all work which is govern by govt help of elected member and all commen citize also write all initial work which is necessary for our area ask  directly for work to elected member for transparency and answer for public conman men question of our all work.its good for govt of india and respected pm sir and comman man for identfy our elected member 
1 0 This is an excellent initiative. Few points: Care should be taken that personal data and identifying information of citizens or other persons should not be made public. Proper stress be given to have the data updated at the highest frequency as possible. For e.g. if it is schedule of trains, it should be kept updated. Other wise the applications made on top of the data will get bad reviews even though no fault of the application creator. Also hope it is easy to use 
0 0 Which govt can give us corruption free country where we  can trust govt servant in all segment from high to low level , could it be possible by applying digital device . I am a poor citizen of India feel proud to be an Indian till death , got  nothing support from govt but now get a chance  to write something & express my word thanks govt of India . 
0 0 no problem at all......even in future.....it is best from all side...any badmind cant do nothing atall...... 
0 0 The idea is good and very much helpful to Indian citizens but if someone wants to register illegaly by bad intension forcibly then it will be very harmful And for how many days the validity wil be there 
0 0 In My Opinion this idea is best. By sharing government data in open domain, many companies, and public can use it to share it with others in the form of free and open domain services including free software, mobile applications, websites and in any digital form. But they should also use the same license " Open Data License India" and should distribute it in public domain.. Give more preferences to Free Services. Otherwise Like CC & GPL, use data for commercial but should also distribute freely. 
0 0 Open data is like a public library. We have few foreign sites where we can obtain only literature survey, but thesis is not available on a particular subject. So YES! govt decision on providing free data to one and all is always welcomed. The authorization of the provided information should be guaranteed as correct. 
0 0 In my opinion, it has both benefits and side effects because:- 1. Information availability can lead to information theft of a person. So, some one can misuse this information for their benefit or for some illegal or terror activities, or for defaming a person etc. It will definitely have lots of benefits also means as long as you guys can deal with the negative impact, this idea of information sharing is awe some. 
0 0 Open geospatial data formats such as KML and GeoJSON can easily be imported into/exported from OpenStreetMap and CartoDB. 
0 0 1.Item 5. Template for Attribution Statement: the user need to state date of accessing data in the attribution statement. 2. It is not clear if the license provided will be transferable or not. 3. it will be great help if there is a timeline for each license issued with a clear policy for renewal. 4. Responsibility of user is not clear: the user, after using information in article, report, web publication, blog etc, need to submit link or copy of the same 
0 0 Implementation Guidelines for National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP) Ver. 2.2 February 2014 identify GML and KML as open geospatial data formats. The European Data Portal identifies KML and GeoJSON as open geospatial data formats: see Choosing the right format for open data, https://www.europeandataportal.eu/elearning/en/module9/#/id/co-01. 
0 0 Proper care needs to be taken so that its not used by competition for wrong reason. Necessary riders should be applied to avoid such situation. Lastly it required wide spread implementation with every user aware of its availability. 
0 0 We can also have a collective data set like open opportunity data for social and economic data analyst to align with specific project . We can also have certain secondary data set from Indian economy and Reserve Bank of India Bulletin. Also some trend analysis, time series analysis with actual base line data, given the timeline should also be available for price index, inflation, export etc which can help different sectors getting business ready with state wise database. 
0 0 1.Our goverment can work with local governments and technologists who can in turn use open data on access to opportunity to create digital tools that help people advocate for resources in their communities. This effort can  focus on facilitating the development of a suite of digital tools that put municipality to even panchayat -level information on access to opportunity at the fingertips of families, community organizers, non-profits, local leaders.

0 0 I just downloaded State-wise IEMs filed by Industrial Undertakings data in excel, how can I find similar info about Software Industry or related to IT. 
0 0 Please see the you tube link https://youtu.be/D-dqhVkEvG8 in the interest of our Country. thanks 
0 0 A request must be taken from the agency seeking data along with what use it is going to make. It should be motivated to do some social service based on this data along with the intended use. A certificate should necessarily be taken that no misuse of data will be done. 
0 0 Whatever the data is kept open to the public, it should be secured and not to go into anti-social elements hands. While login you need to keep authentic proof of identities for each user. 
0 0 In continuation to previous coomment, I want to say that; Don't just send mails about the initiatives, things must be reached to everone else in the society, what is usability of perticular utility that must be cheked & people must be made aware about it's use. Then only it can make the difference & we can excel towards developement, even more faster.

0 0 First thing is that bring up the things in understandable format for the common man, Most of the times it becomes difficult to understand that, what exactly  these all activities are meant for, Only experts in perticular domain can have idea about it & they can only understand it, so ultimately that same set of people will have benifit of it. Whereas, Things must be communicated to the people in proper manner, excelent class presentations of new initiatives must be prepared & displayed to all. 
0 0 Excellent job 
0 0 4) If there is any pre-conditions for using any data, then it is not 'open' data. So,if the Government considers some data to be sensitive and not to be shared this way, then they should simply not enlist that here. Put another way, every piece of data put up on the platform's site, must be open; otherwise, it should not be put up at all. 5) Annotations and tags - if any - of the data, must be in English, in addition to other languages that the government deems appropriate. 
0 0 Good initiative. A few suggestions (perhaps, already being considered anyway): 1) Data must be categorized very clearly and meaningfully, and navigation through them should be easy. 2) JSON and CSV formats MUST BE supported; these are de-facto standards these days and open too 3) Authenticity of data is the responsibility of whosoever is producing and sharing it, not of the consumers (contd..) 
0 0 Keeping confidentialities on the Nation's securities and interest it is a excellant approach by Govt. Moreover login of the site be based on Aadhar/PAN/or any unique no.by which the authentic and clear identity of the person be established as and needed.

0 0 This looks good. One more sugegstion, these data should always be maintained in database in a proper query-able format. 
0 0 All govt tenders, purchases,auctions,dealers,lease,rent details given online with prices terms. All work,contracts  should be given with details with all details so that no need of RTI. 
0 0 [9] Standard Functions can be allowed openly for public use... It can be of free of cost... Users can download and integrate the data as per their requirement. [10] Sometimes, some users require customized abstracted data of different agencies for which the data integration is very difficult for them due to numerous raw data sources.. An agency can be appointed for extracting the data as per the user's requirement and Fee can be levied for the same.... 
0 0 Very good initiative. Please start  as early as possible. Eagerly awaiting. 
0 0 Very Good initiative. This will definitely bring lot of change and will help startups and new businesses. In my opinion, things to concern are data security and how to avoid possible misuse.

1 0 Why leave encashment of central govt and state govt employees any extant is tax free whereas PSU employees is exempted upto Rs. 3.00 lac and rest amount is taxable. Are we not the citizen of India,  we are so highly paid or are given extra leave than the govt employees. It is a big anamoly which should be removed immediately. I retired on 30.11.15 and I had to pay tax on my encashment of leave over the amount of Rs. 3.00 lakh. These could be earned at the cost of I kept away from family  . 
0 0 Examination should occur because on the basis of School Marksheet candisature for job selection will be irrelevant as we very well heard of the Case of Bihar Topper Marksheet scam which is bewilderdly continuing in the states of Bihar & Uttar Pradesh and many other's. 
0 0 Would the data that is analyzed through open government source be priced? Can this be accompanied by a webpage where the each department shares the kind of data being demanded? 
1 0 #THE 7TH PAY COMMISSION WILL BE IMPLEMENTED SOON. MY SUGGESTION IS TO DEDUCT 10% OF NET MONTHLY  SALARY OF EVERY MALE GOVT SERVANT AND DEPOSIT IT INTO HIS WIFES/SPOUSE BANK ACCOUNT OPENED IN NATIONALIZED BANKS ONLY AS WOMEN RIGHT.

0 0 #NCERT CONDUCTS NATIONAL TALENT SEARCH EXAM EVERY YEAR IN TWO STAGES THROUGHOUT INDIA TO DISBURSE 1000 SCHOLARSHIPS WORTH 1.5 CRORE  PER YEAR .AS PER THE RECENT FIGURES AVAILABLE THE STUDENTS APPEARING IN THE NTSE EXAMINATION SPENDS ALMOST 5 CRORE IN TRANSPORTATION. THE suggestion IS TO PICK UP TOPPERS FROM EACH HIGH SCHOOL,THEN BY PREPARING A MERIT LIST ,THE FIRST 1000 STUDENTS CAN EASILY SELECTED WITHOUT CONDUCTING ANY TYPE OF TALENT SEARCH EXAM. 
0 0 1. JSON should be added as a supported data format. 2. The 'No Warranty' clause defeats the purpose. It 'data provider' must be responsible for the accuracy (and availability) of the data. 
0 0 Adequate provisions should be there to safeguard the security of the country and such data should not be shared to the public which may be detrimental to the security of the country. 
0 0 Dear Pragnya Raja,Now those want to disturb the world have very good access to all kinds of information.No need to worry about security issues.We need to train our Citizens to use the information for skill development and personal development.Here in Saudi Arabia,the skill is very important.Small works like wiring,electrical fitters are earning much.But they are from Philippines,such a small country.We need Skill India. 
0 0 It was a great initiative.I prefer the open data usage.We in india have a lot of manpower,intelligents but does not have access and true data for improving knowldge.We get information mostly from mouth to mouth,this kind have 30% reliable.By open data ,every citizen can access to true information,knowldge,innovative way.this will educate our people for sure. 
0 0 its  a  nice process  to say  something  to  govt  .very  good  . 
2 0 It is Good Step taken by Govt. but some points should be taken carefully. 1- How can we check if someone is sharing/misusing this data. there should be full proof check(24/7) 2- Who will ensure that the data what we are putting of open govt. data platform is not sensitive n dangerous of our security purpose and it can't be used by bad elements. 3- Addhar/Pan No should be necessary for account/loging creation and ip address/ location etc. should be recorded during login/accessing data. 
0 0 #Clause5: Providing access to everyone for data might lead to security issues. It would be great if they can have authorizations based on which people can access the data in depth. Ex: A registered Indian Doctor gets more info about his stream compared to an engineer or a farmer or a non-indian doctor. This way we might restrict data leakage to an extent.#GovernmentOpenDataUseLicenseIndia

All the hospital (government, private and semi government) and clinic (including private and government) should mention the patient details in that government portal whenever they come to them. So no doctor need to ask patient where your previous paper, just asks for patient unique code and current issues. Get them updated in government portable with treatment.

0 0 Sir, it should be start to stop the corruption & bribe. 
0 0 Even after being an expert, I don't find any relevant information here. Only words like data, open data, share data are repeated. Information displayed is not at all structured or hierarchy based. If this is for common man of India. Information must be more simply displayed. 
0 0 i am in manufacturing sector, while one the one hand there is problem of unemployment of youths on the other hand we don't get skilled or semi skilled people to work. These people are very unstable thus result in loss of continuty of production process, sometimes provide false credentials too. Please bring a system to streamline labour flow, Mark their skills in centralised database where we can cross check their background/ performances, allow us to rate their skill set 
0 0 It is high tin to have a drastic change in our traffic laws if we want this country to become a flag bearer nation in the world. Traffic laws having a biased tilt towards two wheelers viz a viz 4 wheelers in respect of violations should be relooked afresh. My experience of driving on Indian roads find 90% violations on the part of 2 wheelers but the law always take sides with 2 wheelers in case of mishaps.

0 0 My sugesstions 1.PREAMBLE : NDSAP Implementation of guidelines to be prepared by an inter-ministerial task force is to include an Intelligence wing. 2.#Clause2.c: Data providers-Nodal Dept which represents data-must be processed by a team of well acquainted/experienced team members of that ministry office formed. 3. #Clause2.f:User- Indian citizen.

0 0 There are lot of loop holes in R & B and Water & Sewerage departments way of execution and coordination among them.  Example issue, there would be cc (concrete) road laid out with lakhs of rupees and then withing 6 months or so, there would be some water pipeline or drain pipeline, so the road to totally dug up and becomes very hard to commute after work id done.  It takes months to years (in my road case, 5 years past, till no road laid out again). Request you to bring in more visibility here. 
0 0 This is really an excellent and  commendable approach by GoI as it will open up the government data, and ensures that data isn’t withdrawn once issued under an open data license. IT is very useful for a populous economy like us and it will really help the GoI to improvise and innovate new ways for faster and steady development. With reference to the draft paper some of the article published by the different agencies. I would like to endorse MediaNama’s view, which is being attached with this com 
0 0 This is excellent approach of Government and it shows that they have nothing hide and want true feedback from the real stakeholders of government. Many suggestions are: 1) RTO should be centralized and all the information including rules, policies etc. should be available easily at Intranet. (IncomeTaxIndia.gov.in) is the best website, if we benchmark. 2) For each and every section/department, there should be facility to give suggestions by the stakeholders. 
0 0 It may be good idea to digitize all the Court cases...We have millions of court cases and lot of them have been going on for years...dismiss all the cases which are not relevant like there was some news that less than 1 Rupee case lasting for over 40 years... 
0 0 #Clause11. Pricing of data may be avoided as that may discourage people from accessing or using it. In case if specific data is sensitive and need traceability of user to prevent misuse then tools like login credentials or social media links can be used to trace users. Pricing at this point of data providence is not conducive to the intent of this Open Data Use License program. 
0 0 I suggest all the govt. deals and other documents ( which are not related to security) should be available for public. We have seen when some scam come in to the light, govt offices dont find documents for those, those are stolen or whole office is burnt sometimes. when documents are public, we can stop these things. 
0 0 Sir...its an appreciating deserve step taken by the Govt. As all the data are easily accessible to anyone, one would like to suggest that a person who want to see the data must enter his/her PAN number, date of birth and OTP on mobile. So that no one can misuse the data of anyone. That the only suggestion i would like to recommend. 
0 0 There should be Data Intelligence used for better data visualization eg. Pie charts, Tables etc. for better data understanding 
0 0 This is surprisingly a welcome step, I am sure our comments to be responded appropriately. At initial stages, there may be some teething problems, but it is a part of development. With best of wishes and good luck. 
0 0 First I'm appreciating my government to come with different schemes. OGDP is most invited scheme. So many questions raising while looking on to the scheme. There is a general negative aspect about government scheme. How are we going to overcome that? The service provided by the government should earn people trust. We are expecting many schemes like this by government with good quality of service. My wishes to the government!! 
1 0 Open Data is something I passionately research about and I congratulate the Indian government for encouraging the larger ecosystem to tap into open government data and generate public value. About the License document, I am concerned that the policy is not in favor of the data consumer because data providers are not mandated to maintain data quality or make data updates regularly #Clause4. Read related blog- https://anveshiatquest.wordpress.com/2015/12/13/ive-opened-my-government... 
1 0 3.2 Data Formats : Widely used JSON data fromat is not incliuded in list . it should be included for better performance in many mobile applications 
0 0 Some boundaries needed to be decided. Also some questions needed answers: Who will get the access the data? How much Data is available to him/her? If someone's personal information is misused by licenses holder what are the set of actions that is needed to be taken? What are the security measures taken against some hacker? 
1 0 I support this! I'm assuming there is a limited scope to the  kind of data that the government will share. This kind of a platform is great for ongoing infrastructure development. Life expectancy of roads and other public works can be standardized minimizing the chance of corruption. 
0 0 Transparency is the best policy but someone people in my country.first is illiteracy and second is curpation 
0 0 The Open data platform is a great effort from our government and i personally appreciate the government of india to start this one for the people of india 
0 0 Exemptions that should be included in the Open Data Use License This license does not grant a person  any right to use: Personal Information; third party rights the Information Provider is not authorized to license; the names, crests, logos, or other official symbols of the Information Provider; and Information subject to other intellectual property rights, including patents, trade-marks and official marks 
0 0 Dear All This is great that India is progressively growing in technologies ,All things are do in one platform , My suggestion is that All government work for public may do by online one unique number like aadhar card/Pan Card are  his/her login & by password & mobile authentication he/she can access facilities to do all types of work like; Passport application,Correction in passport,Corporation ,Income tax, Applications, person can submit his suggestion/complaints also . Thanks 
0 0 Public should be allowed to Copy, modify, publish, translate, adapt, distribute or otherwise use the Information in any medium, mode or format for any lawful purpose under the authorization of the data officer then only i think this can be a open data license 
0 0 But why it should be licensed ? licensing has its own pros and corns  as at one end if you go by constitutional rights  each and every individual has right to access all the information available in public domain but this platform can be misused by few opportunist to create undue litigation just for name sake and to kill already tumbling JUDICIAL SYSTEM.So it should be open to public without any license but  with a condition that this data can not be used for any type of litigation. 
0 0 Transparency in data exchange is a welcome move provided this does not provide forum for sensitive information to elements involved in treachery and treason. In the present national scenario extreme care should be taken. 
0 0 open goverment data platform is a good idea. 
0 0 Internet For All(IFA).The main scope of this concept is to provide awareness, knowledge and the usage of internet to the students in rural area Womens. As per our honorable Prime Minister Mr.Narendra Damodardas Modi’s dream of Digital India, we try to motivate our rural students to become professionals of India. By implementation of this concept we could bring awareness to rural women's school students about the up-to-date events and information about technology and other fields. 
0 0 Sir, whatever development one makes in the technology for the public use, people throughout the world find a way to misuse it and make it a useless one. Please adopt the method to stop cyber crimes and hacking in this new one too. Granting is more important but saving the same is much more important. 
0 0 NIC develops a software application that runs only on proprietary Operating Systems and distributes it free of cost to MoRD for deployment in over 1,27,000 gram/block panchayats all over India. Since the proprietary operating system can only be bought from Ms Microsoft Inc, the company is assured of over Rs 5 lakhs for buying all the requisite operating system and database management system. Imagine the money that Microsoft gets - Rs 6350 crores. How can we prevent such theft of public funds? 
0 0 Dear all, This is a very courageous initiative taken by our government. As we have entered in the 21 st century,there are many peoples still searching empty bottles/plastic/waste foods from CITY GARBAGE/WASTAGE for their day needs (FOR EARNING MONEY) and earns around Rs. 50 to 60 per days.can we make their unity with the help of WHATSAPP OR FACEBOOK & make them SWACHH INDIA-SWACHHATA DOOT.so that even these peoples have right to stay alive in this DIGITAL WORLD. 
0 0 NIC develops and application that runs only on proprietary Operating Systems and distributes it free of cost to MoRD for deployment in over 1,27,000 gram/block panchayats all over India. Since the proprietary operating system can only be bought from Ms Microsoft Inc, the company is assured of over Rs 10 lakhs for buying all the requisite operating system and database management system. Imagine the money that Microsoft gets - Rs 12700 crores. Why can't we prosecute NIC/MoRD for this lapse ? 
0 0 this is a good initiative by Govt. but very late since this is already available in many countries... the most important thing is the validity of the person who uses the data to be addressed and information of each user to be captured to avoid any illegal activities 
1 0 It's a great endeavor on the Government's part. The successful implementation will have a very big impact on the way the system works and make life easy for both the public and Officials in general and would reduce paper work. The Govt should utilize the existing systems like Aadhar and integrate all such information of the public like DL, PAN etc. The biggest challenge though will be to  maintain and update such a large database as well as have a full proof secure system which is hackproof 
0 0 This is good may i think useful every one thank you ruler 
0 0 I think for the 1st time, we the people of India have been involved to strengthen the pillars of the democracy. We feel respected and welcome the Modi Govt. to implement the open data but first work on the precautions from misuse. There should also be certain restrictions on who the person is using the know your citizen based on passport id only. As Aadhar card have been issued to Bangladesh refugees & Pakistani terrorists also. 
1 0 Dear Sir, It is a welcome initiative.I would suggest some openness to happen in the Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Department of Chennai. As many people rely on the amenities provided in the Ration Shops, even for a change of address between districts it takes more than 3 weeks.There is a huge demand of Bribery in many regions.I kindly request you that these operations should be made online and e-seva centers be provided  to avoid bribe and enable work faster in a smoother way. 
0 0 Its really appreciate the work doing by the government for digitisation. Data/information was valuable. The data should be use for common man not for the corporate use or political use. Create big data information on the weather and farmers to cultivate food grains. Like online shopping portals, gov has to create data which should be useful and access for free to farmers to do their job easy and easy to handle natural calamities. 
0 0 Its a thumbs up! Only request is that all state government data should also be integrated into the common platform. There should not be any politics for sharing of data between central and state governments. It should be seamlessly shared. Thanks to all who have dared to be innovative in our government. Good Job Sir/Madam. 
0 0 sharing public data should be allowed but up to certain limit 
0 0 This is a very good initiative by the govt..I appreciate it. Just one thing though, why not keep the right to use this information being provided restricted to only indian citizens free of cost..for others like foreign media houses a royalty maybe charged...I know its a fairly difficult thing to implement due to the global nature of internet..but worth a try. 
0 0 Hi, Open Data policy is a good move but with every good move comes a bad motive also. So public sensitive data should be handled with utmost care. It should not fall into miscreant people or unauthorised sources. Strict login procedure through either Aadhaar OTP authentication or any other measures should be strictly adhered so that proper tracking of login and online upload/download of data can be tracked at any time if needed. 
0 0 Respected sir, I am residing in Boisar, Maharshtra State. Boiar is situated in Palghar District.  I am just informing you regarding the Roads in Boisar-Palghar area.  In the rainy season we can't travel through our roads.  after rainy season the road contractors will done a patch work only, after some time the roads are same like old conditions. All the gutters, filled full of water, so that, mainly the two wheelers can't see the deep of gutters. So please take action for good road. SALEELAN N 
0 0 Respected Sir/Madam, Its OK to share data that's relevant on any forum until and unless it doesn't hamper the safety and security of me or any of the related people, that includes , financial security and identity risks too...Additionally , If there has to be an online identification system , It has to be two ways.For example -If a person is looking up for my details , there should be a valid reason and I should be the approver of who can actually access that data, except government authorities. 
0 0 by preparing an automatic biomatric & facereader or dna system to know about some one and in that site should be total profile of citizen (police verification,adhar ,pan ,passportno etc ) 
0 0 Its a good idea, government is trying to do Transparency work. Its good, I appreciate it. But I have a doubt, Weather the data available is true to its expectation or not? If Govt is trying to Change the original data and manipulate it and present some thing in front of us, then i would think this is not a good Idea.

1 0 Few countries have online identification system by just taking passport number or driving license number in online form and backend systems verify it in govt database. No need of Xerox and waste of paper and hassle free. This type of system can be developed by govt. No need of sharing this type of data to public. Data like transportation, education can be shared. 
0 0 Respected Sir, it is very good news about Government Start Open Data Use License, in this system it very useful to all our citizens, in this system public can use and access data smoothly. All over it is a good idea but I have some doubt about this Open Data system. In our country peoples can firstly misuse the facility then after use is well. In open data system, I suggest you that all the data that Government want to publish to peoples in open source are in under high-level security. 
0 0 #4. The data in the system should bear the date (and time stamp) of posting. The data should be updated meticulously abd promptly, so that thre latest information is available to public at large.There should also be  a reference who can be contacted by mail/ phone etc. in case any clarification is required. 
0 0 Government open data can be very useful in shaping a digital India. Maximum people are using apps now a days and exploiting this data for convenience of people can speed up sharing of information and various government process. This data can be shared to App developers upon registering their identity and even govt. can create apps using this data. This network can be a ground base for more digital facilities. And yes it will curb corruption as well. apps for college admission registration, etc. 
0 0 #Clause6 - Exemption should also include restriction of access to requests for data originating from High risk countries.

0 0 These days Media is misusing their power very badly and Govt is not taking any action against these National Channels(example:Timesnow etc.), their arrogance and selective news spoiling the nation, no ethics in news, there should be a strict action against these channels, because some of the critical issues have been projected and hyped very badly which is effecting the security of this Country. Secondly strict action on corruption should be taken in Govt offices where common man is suffering 
0 0 Is this an attempt to be used as RTI alternative? or it is aimed to check corruption by infusing a fear element in people involved in corrupt practices by letting them know that, whatever they are doing, people(big brother) is watching? Yes, transparency is the one single element which can help in checking corruption. If, we are really serious about checking corruption, there should be one open web site of National Vigilance where any citizen of India can give bribe related information/proofs. 
0 0 Sir, I would like to submit to consider my proposal to issue CREDIT CARDS to Government Offices against their Bank Account (Budget) for purchasing Official requirement/stationery/branded equipments/furniture etc. ONLINE at more competitive rates. It may also help to reduce corruption in purchasing items from Open Market and enhance transparency. The Government offices may avail DISCOUNT/REBATE on ONLINE purchase. Naturally, such ONLINE purchasing will be within the allocated budget. 
0 0 Great Initiative,  should insure that data is regulerly updataed and servers are up,  I am sure there will be SLA on up time,  maintainance and support.Thanks.

0 0 Indian government has huge data of each and every department and dumping in files and our public is not aware  about it.Open Data portal  is very good step taking by Indian government.but govt. has to make sure the data will not miss use .I congratulation to Indian govt. by this step in our system will transparent,equality ,sharing of knowledge,and most important think public will understand  about the govt.work. 
0 0 Suggestions - (1) Data User shall be registered after valid ID submission (2) Data shall be distributed within India for non-commercial use only (No one shall sell this data for the commercial benefit or profit purposes (3) There shall be Nominal fee for accessing certain amount of data within minimum limit (4) If data volume limit is exceeding, justification for the data usage shall be asked and shall be charged for the commercial organization/company 
0 0 Sir you see that youngsters of present era are busy on social networking sites cracking very good and brainy jokes and they can be helpful in suggesting innovative and brainy ways to improve our society and you welcome their ideas by giving them any incentives to motivate them to give their ideas with their awesome brains 
0 0 #Clause5 : append at the end "also including data/information which is of educational use in Schools,Colleges and mandatory certification/implementation Standards formulated by Govt bodies/organisations. (Justification: There are more than 130 mandatory certification products as per various Quality Control Orders, but the "Indian Standards" containing details about the quality parameters for these products are sold only by BIS offices for Rs.300 to Rs.15000) 
0 0 Transparency is needed to make people aware of what is happening and it will help to be in touch with new techniques..At the same time there should be some safety and methods to tackle incase if any problem arises..Since it is free of cost, datas should not go in wrong hands as it will pose problem to our Indian security..Definitely it's a good move by our government...Will support together for our nation growth..

0 0 Single Central Depository/ custodian is highly needed. This can be accessed by all stakeholders by payment of nominal fees so that the data retrieving is genuine and authentic. Even the person authority must be obtained before providing data access to the stakeholders. All can be stakeholders ranging from general public to government departments to courts to private companies etc. This can also be a big revenue source for the govt to be used for betterment of data servers and data advancements 
0 0 Under the title of terms and conditions of use of data, Point 4 (D) No warranty clause - It should be changed as it is having condition of no liability of Data Provider by the government in direct or indirect case. Government Should ensure the liability of those clauses under which common man is using it in any decision making based on the information source of Open Government Data. 
1 0 It is a welcome move of the government towards transparency. Yes, the data should be available free of cost to all. 
0 0 No doubt that this initiative will encourage transparency. 
0 0 Historical weather data (GHI,Avg Min/max Temp) required for designing efficient solar power plants that are recorded by IMD weather stations in India should be made free.

1 0 It is a very good idea of sharing data under open form. I am from Bengaluru and I have applied for Fresh Passport.I am waiting for Police varification,when I visited and enquired about PVR,Police Official instead of visiting and varifying my residential address ,they are telling me come again to police station with all documents which I have submitted to Passport Office and with 2 Photos.I feel it very absurd. 
3 0 Through Hydro-Meteorological Data Dissemination Policy(2013) Ministry of Water Resources and Central Water Commission (CWC) has hindered the progress of India. Most of the time MoWR and its technical arm, CWC simply don't provide river discharge data for any study or research work. As a result no research and fruitful study could place in absence of hydrological data in Ganga and Brahmaputra river basins, where appx. half of the population of India lives. 
0 0 This is a very positive step taken by our government. In my point of view its equally important that the private organizations also follow this Open Data process. 
0 0 The Various state governments have taken over Temples and their revenue. There  needs to be data on the revenue collected and the expenditure made by the endowments department. There is loot that is happening that can be curbed if data(on Temples controlled by Endowments department) is shared. I hope you are serious about sharing data of key departments where there is loot happening. 
1 0 All the Policies and Data should be made reachable to public ( Except for the data which may affect our national security).Licensing at a nominal fee online registration etc is good to know who is accessing what. 
1 1 You are requested to keep this data open to registered authorities only. i.e. all the professionals using this data should first register them for acquiring this info. We should Allow only this data to professionals like CA, Lawyers, Gazzeted officers, registered organizations, Doctors, etc. If we make this data available to Ministers or local bodies like corporators, they can use this for interest of their vote banks only. The preesure will then build on Govt. authorities as in case of RTI. 
2 0 Minimize requirement of personal contact between Govt. department and people. Only digital contact should be practiced: no Govt. official will ever dare to ask for bribe digitally. Assign time limit to a case at the initiation stage itself. 
0 0 Govt Need Some Type of Policy that given Responsbility of work for a Govt Employee in govt Dept........i have both the exprience govt and pvt......at pvt company one day work equals to govt employee one month work......and they behave like they have lots of work.....This time lots of work is good . 
0 0 this is very good in initiative by the govt. to improve transparency and equip the public. congratulations to the NAMO team 
1 0 there is lot off id cards, aadhar card, pan card driving licence card, ration card, voters id. so on... why do we need so much cards cannot you just provide one smart card with all the details. so many mismatch / mistakes in data available, each one have some errors. 
1 0 Please add all government works digital india. So many lazy government officials still there and also there is lot of corruption still going on. Each every government office.. for birth/death certificate, land registration, so many. 
0 0 This is a good step towards Govt's Working TransparanIn most jurisdictions there are intellectual property rights in data that prevent third-parties from using, reusing and redistributing data without explicit permission. Even in places where the existence of rights is uncertain, it is important to apply a license simply for the sake of clarity. Thus, if you are planning to make your data available you should put a license on it – and if you want your data to be open this is even more important. 
1 0 Plzz provide time series historical data so that can be analysed. 
0 0 Data will help to analyse govt. officers work as well as data from private Sectors organization will create clarity in public. So it's good initiative by government. But this data should be fair not manipulated just to fool people. 
0 0 This is a good step towards Govt's Working Transparancy Policy vis a vis actual execution practice on ground, so as to link Policy Makers with whom & for whom the Policy is made. 
0 0 It is a good initiative from the part of the Govt. But make sure that the data is actual and not manipulated. It can be sued for research purposes with India Data. So far almost all the researches in India are depending on Open data available in foreign countries. Hats off to the team responsible for this step.

0 0 #Clause1: All the Open data should should have sections stating the direct implications of the current values to the common man in layman terms #Clause2: If precautionary measures need to be mentioned, so be it #MyGov 
1 0 First of all we should define our role "OPEN DATA POLICY" a. If it is open then don't think about what people will do with that data. b. It is a responsibility of the government to aware all of us, what is going on in our offices and what government provide n think of our people. c. On top of priority combine all of the voterid, driving licence, passport, aadhar and other so many schemes into single platform..WE WANT ONLY ONE..this will reduce corruption and provide transparency 
0 0 I have got a power point presentation on Big Data analytics for national planning. Please facilitate to upload this. 
0 0 We are talking of Digital India, and Government Ministry #MEA not recognising even Adhaar data as a valid proof of address and requires police verification for establishing my identity!!!!  What a contrast?? 
0 1 Open Data Policy should take several points into consideration before bringing it into Implementation: 1) Are there any other governments in world which have done this & what are their experiences? 2) Research some empirical studies of other countries, for what purposes public is using others' data? 3) Once data goes to public, Govt. has no control on what for public uses data. Hence, you need to filter it while data distribution itself. -All the best Dr.G.P.Sudhakar,PhD,PMP 
1 0 Data will help to analyse govt. officers work as well as data from private institution like school will create clarity in public. its is good initiative by government. But this data should be fair not manipulated just to fool people. 
0 0 #MyGov in punjab(india) under digital india license and registration is online but everbody take bribe to make it. Even there is no vigilence officer contact given. I have complaint to many officers online under digital india but no body reply. 
0 0 As Open Data may contain structured and machine readable format best way to make it public #Clause1: Integrate all the datas in Big Data(Ex: Hadoop etc.) platform. #Clause2: Upload the data into Cloud environment. #Clause3: Design any Android/iOS app to make all the data accessible from cloud. #Clause4: Data should be accessible to all the citizen of India who has Aadhaar number. So make the registration in the app to the public data in such a way where Aadhaar number is mandatory. 
0 0 a very good and progressive initiative by the govt. of India Move forward and keep up the good work.#OpenDataLicenceIndia 
0 0 I believe that the improvements with regard to Government Open Data Use License would be beneficial to the majority. 
0 0 Custom data requests should also be made available,24/7 toll free number should be present and try to privatize as much as possible. 
0 0 This is very good idea. definitely it will be useful for various sectors particularly startup companies. i request you to interconnect of state governments Labor departments to verification of all registered companies current status and we can offer to web application for peoples to check current status of the company anytime. Yearly verification and auditing should be mandatory for all active companies. That will be helpful to worldwide business connections.

0 0 Make sure there is not time passing since almost 3 years over,, first clean up the corrupted in govt offices, bribes, etc, If possible make it privatized Banks, Power sector, etc, as its threat to society, instead of diverting public attention, Where is swiss money, where is black money,,, The country under threat, curtail the Defense expenses, middle man deal, if you buy all from abroad, what is the use of HAL< DRDO etc, just time passing national burden heavy salaries,heavy investment etc, 
0 0 Ope Data License should be real time, currently most of the important citizen services online data doesn't matches the real work time progress, some data which are under decisions / approvals / scrutinized / permissions / licenses / acknowledgement of the applications are intentionally kept pending or the government employees dont want to upload the status in time or not capable, time line should be defined to match the realtime data and the status period to complete the task... 
0 0 First make the Govt Depts accountable as many govt depts just time passing without any use to public specifically the power sectors, the banks ,IT office etc just time passing in offices make sure its utilized efficiently or make it privatized , then all will be alright since just for job security, no job monitoring etc, its threat to society , public need to feed them with heavy salaries, closed down sick industries first like BHEL, BEL, HAL etc, all anti people, as well national waste ,,, huge

0 0 शिक्षा के मामले में मेरे कुछ विचार हैं। आज की शिक्षा बहुत लम्बी और समय बरबाद करने वाली हैं। शिक्षा के बहाने जितना समय बरबाद होता है, वह पूरी तरह काम नहीं आता है। जितनी शिक्षा प्राप्त कर डिग्रियां हासिल करते हैं, नौकरी प्राप्त करने पर उस शिक्षा का मात्र 5 या 10 प्रतिशत तक ही काम आता है। और 90 से 95 प्रतिशत बेकार चला जाता है। क्यों न विद्यार्थियों को मेट्रिक के बाद से ही किसी नौकरी में शामिल करके उसी नौकरी के अनुसार शिक्षा दी जाए। उसी नौकरी में अनुभव और शिक्षा देते हुए उसे पदोन्नति दिया जाए।

0 1 Being an Open Data advocate, my suggestion is to have data funnels to be made available to cater the needs of enterprise large and small alike. It could need building dedicated data centers like Apple setting one underground in rural Denmark. Also important to track who can monetize data & Government can arrange few international hackathons to visualize usage of such data for greater good. And such data interface should not be allowed to be manipulated by request of feminists/pressure groups 
0 1 Thanks for providing me such an ample opportunity to raise my view. 1st thing: The impacts can be either way' Pro and Con. As we are however registered to write this, the info should be available only for people who are registered. Also  I'd like to ask you to setup a 3rd layer of verification like a pancard Id, Aadhar. Our nation is now dealing with larger threats and one of them is data theft that could lead to imbalance in economical standard of India.please setup an 3rd level authentication 
1 0 A lot of open data is available on Wikipedia. Would love to see a similar open project initiated by government and run and maintained by Indians all over the world. It can named Indipedia because it should be aimed at comprehensive coverage of our rich and varied heritage. It should contain information regarding everything Indian or related to India. Tagline can be Glory of the Great Indian Subcontinent. A parallel open project can be aimed at tracing Indian lineages so that each Indian becomes 
0 0 Government idea us awesome. But there will be few glitches in  implementation part if we don't define correctly what 'GOVERNMENT DATA' mean and what 'OPEN  DATA'  mean. Government has data relating to different sectors out which only few can be shared to public.  So instead of Government data we can use the term 'GOVERNMENT SHARABLE DATA' that would make sense. Utilization of sharable data should be defined with proper guidelines. Coming to implementation it should not be like RTI act 
0 0 # Clause 2.2.2: I think clarity is needed with the term "manipulated". If raw data is published, it should not allow any manipulation besides masking of sensitive or restricted data as mandated by the law, acts, etc. Processed data may be open to manipulation prior its publication, however the # Clause 2.2.7: must provide the clarity if the data is processed or raw. Addition: Time of availability of data; access to such data within specified standard of time is must to keep data relevant.

Data of national importance which may be created problems if will be in the hand of India's enemy through out the world should be banned.

Data of national importance which may be created problems if will be in the hand of India's enemy through out the world should be banned. 
0 0 Sir in the perspective of digital india scheme, my idea is something related to agricultural markets. Government should install digital price table for various crops based on the export value. So that farmers are aware of prices of crops. The bills regarding this should be given as print outs from the billing machine with gps technology rather than handwritten bills in order to prevent corruption. I conclude that people should be benefited by the peoples government. Thank you sir. 
0 0 #Clause1 I want to state a simple thing the problem which I faced while travelling by a local in west Bengal. Since I was not from that state and it was very crowded and I was standing in midst of the crowd it was impossible to know which station the train is crossing and which is the next one. I think in all the local trains of every state this should be digitally shown and announced as in metros and locals of Mumbai. Even in normal trains this facility should be there. 
2 0 Purpose and identification must be compulsory. 
0 0 Thanks a lot of our government for such a great work in public welfare. 
1 0 Great!Its a nice initiative. 
0 0 Wanted to draw attention about today incident of recording of parliament made by AAP member. Also a old incident on which some member were caught seeing unethical videos. A suggestion to gov.is to allow basic/bar phone (no multimedia) only on which no camera function available so that no recording can be made. That will help a lot. 
0 0 I am based in Bhopal and doing the business of waste management. We construct Biogas plants in FRP with 10 years guaranty anf with a life of minimum 30-35 years with no maintenance cost involved. As the awareness in MP & CG is almost zero towards waste management. As I am doing awareness campaigns for the last 2 years with no effect either on the government department or the private department. The government department has to do some initiatives local government make the rule strict else no use 
0 0 #Clause4e) Data accidentally published that falls under clause 6 of exceptions should be removable and (clause 4e) shouldn't be applicable for that. #clause 6- Exceptions seems a little vague. More specific can be included. General: Utmost and max care, with 2/3 reviews and approvals (by totally unconnected and random approvers from various regions of nation) should be in place before any data is being published under open-Data. And such approvals mustn't go upon majority but by 100%

1 0 It's a great move and policy document is also well drafted. As stated by few more reviewers it'll be good if respective government agencies follow the latest IT standards (REST API, JASON, XML Format) for data sharing. 
0 0 Thanks a lot! Its a fine beginning. 
0 0 As a data scientist who has worked with 'open municipal data' in the US, I am somewhat familiar with some issues with such data. One primary issue is the data format. The format of the data files should be preferably in a commonly used format. The other big issue is privacy. If any dataset contains user information, care should be taken to make the data as anonymous as possible. An annual conference should be organized on open data to promote use of such data and see it's benefits. 
0 0 Thanks a lot. It's a good step towards progressive india. 
0 0 This is a great initiative, but in software term the draft is quite loose. #4.d Define accuracy and quality %, inaccurate public data makes no sense and if provided by ministries can be used for political/personal gains #3 Personal information of user should also be protected Define layers of information/users that will lead to transparency, centre/state/district/region...include agriculture and population and overall health of department Define data accuracy in reports 
0 0 Thats a great initiative.. keep growing Regards Salman Noorani https://www.letsearnmoneyonline.in 
0 0 Excellent Idea. Why not make all other government reports and RTI replies in Public domain? The main idea for requesting to make RTI replies in public domain is that THE SAME QUESTIONS WILL NOT BE POSED AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THE CPIO and also the response could be seen by other concerned citizens and they make give voice if the response given by the CPIO is unreasonable. From my personal experience, the motive of the RTI is not fulfilled by the CPIOs. They deliberately deny information. 
0 0 #clause10 pricing should be in different brackets and affordable for all. Hope this doesn't mean the govt opens up the data and only R com's can afford to access it. #acessing the data should follow the Facebook big data design a graph Api methodology would be the best much more useful in connecting the dots and reaching the aim of non duplication of agencies working to recollect the same data for different purpose.

0 0 It’s good initiative and since its inception in 2012, the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP) has made commendable progress.  In order to keep momentum going on, here are few suggestions/recommendations. 
0 0 We are getting thousands of fake calls daily as they tell us that they are talking from Reliance/IRDAI/HDFC etc..There should be govt. code assigned to them which should be displayed whenever they are calling us or we are getting the call from their call-center so that they cant cheat us. 
0 0 #Clause1 Open data for all. This i suggest to Govt. Of India. People should have right to choose. Now a days in India people pays higher amount for data services. Many a times i found the speed data download is much more slower. If open data license given then there will be fair competition amongst all companies. And they will provide higher speed. In competition the charge also will be much more less. It will not only save money but also it will save time of work. We should go beyond 3G and 4G. 
0 0 Please take care of our data rest you guys do anything. Data security is very crucial in such case 
0 0 Today, I was travelling in the metro and what I see, one lady was not well, she was feeling faint and vomiting but could not find space to vomit. Eventually she vomited on the floor. Everybody was feeling so bad for her. Stink was spreading in metro badly.I just want to know as we always talk about swatch Bharat and paying tax to make more clean and even we don't have any option in metro to vomit or thrown garbage. I would request to make some options in metro to vomit in emergency situation. 
0 0 #Clause8: There needs to be greater clarity around the redressal mechanism 
0 0 It is really a welcome move. Transparency should be maintained at every level. Internet speed is the biggest problem in this country. Ultimately it will effect Digital India vision of our PM. Speed of the internet should be maintained as per plan with unlimited usage as in other countries. It will be first step towards Digital India. 
0 0 #OpenDataLicence I'd suggest having uniform data format and REST web services. Since it's government platform with a lot of information, the platform should be designed to be fail proof with high availability (IRCTC site is an example of high volume). There should also be ways for the platform to push updates to consumers rather than the consumers polling for it everytime which will lead to a lot of traffic on the government's site. Rather it should be possible to subscribe for updates. 
0 0 Make data plans affordable to farmers students or strictly make compulsion to all data service providers to provide free data services for websites like all government websites of every department, students websites, agriculture information or farm goods dealing websites, Job providers websites, GPS tracking, matrimonial website, whether information, emergency services free of cost with fast data transfer speed at least 3G. Please sir Do this for better future of our country 
0 0 I think the speed of internet is absolutely disgusting. 3G 4G are for name sake only. There are number of countries who give internet speed of 28 Mbps. It is my humble request to government to work on it. If we get high speed internet everything will become easy. Secondly if we can get mobile range direct through satellite then then connectivity problem will be solved as in no.of villages we are unable to get mobile range.also in emergency situation we must be able to contact emergency nos 
0 0 In my opinion, I am only wanting to share that if the benefit side of Open Data Use or NDSAP is more and if it is accessible to all the sites not only to social networking sites, then only it is useful otherwise it is a crap as social networking sites have harmful effects more than that of its usefulness like Chatting with awkward topics or gossiping and time wasting... Govt. should think over it that which side is better for which age groups. There must be a division among them. Thank You...

0 0 #MyGov: Waste management: E-waste, chemical and harmful by products of factories and urban population should be tracked and dealt with. There are economical and green way of recycling waste and there are companies out there that can convert this waste into valuable products. If there are types of waste that still doesn't have a safe way of disposal, research in that area needs to be initiated and if possible, temporarily suspend usage of those sources. All of this can be data driven. 
0 0 I have worked on many corporate's BI and Data Warehousing projects.  Now I am working on Big Data.  The purpose of creating a Data Warehouse is there is only one truth about the company.  But it is very difficult to achieve.  The data gov body need to concentrate on this first.  How two or more departments are not going to give different data for the same subject (even spelling mistakes of citi's names will become a huge problem).  If there is a difference, how to resolve them. 
0 0 #OGD That's a really great idea...nd a great initiative though I would like to suggest to have some restrictions as open data can be used for wrong purposes...like,maybe,d users with aadhar card only can have the access to it and should have a password for it...nd others who are not Indians and don't have aadhar card and are in India for work...should have some other process... This is just a suggestion...but something of that kind should be done... 
0 0 I was at the PMO yesterday (20th July 2016) to discuss four innovative Projects, each socially relevent, and World First. I was told that despite the Projects' innovativeness, for implementation, the Government "will have to go through the tendering process". I ask, in that case, what is the incentive to the innovator and what reward does the innovator get for the innovative Project, if all can bid? 
0 0 Another thing is that continuous maintenance and updating the data.  As we all know, there are so many rules in India, but no one follows it.  As the apex data body, how this department is going to make sure that the data is updated periodically and the servers are maintained correctly.  Otherwise, somebody will use the servers to store their household expenses.... 
0 0 I highly appreciate this initiative by the #government. I will say that the data regarding the Research in the Society, Government ventures and data which is helpful to the Startups should be made available.

0 0 The Indian Govt is so big and it has diversified portfolios.  The Govt, Open Data should set the policies like authentication, authorization, classification of the date, usage of the data etc.  The individual departments should follow the rules and add specifics with respect to their data.  The natural resources's data is completely different from the postal data.  Instead of one platform managing the entire data, it should be managed as sub platforms. 
0 0 Please control price rise and unrest in kashmir 
1 0 A great initiative taken by the government of India.Iwould suggest that data regarding the expenditure of the ministers and the officers(except for the confidential ones)should also be published here to facilitate more transparency,but intellectual property must not be included.

0 0 Data should be made available in multiple formats. Major/popular and easy to parse and use data formats like JSON and XML must be made mandatory for any data being generated on this platform. 
0 0 The data and information to public are to be made in a simple way so that everyone can access and understand without help of consultants as they are charging too much and benefits from common man's unawareness. Ticketing system (via mail or via application) is appreciable for detailed enquiry/ clarification in each sector. So that everyone will feel security of getting information from reliable source.

0 0 Although it's a Great Idea, and bring more transparency in the system in many aspects, But the Only concern which haunts me is about security, Level of Information which would be shared among public, It should neither be that much open which become threat to the national secuirty nor it should be more constraint to make no difference. Thank & Regards Sumir Kumar Jha

0 0 Link Aadhaar Card with critical areas Income Tax, Driver License, Passport, Voter ID. However it should be limited. If citizen or resident of India provide the Aadhaar number Government Of India, Police, Security Personnel, Tax Department should get the entire details of the individual. This will help in many ways and avoid fraudulent. 
0 0 This is a welcome step in the right direction. this will increase transparency, and accountability. the data published should be exhaustive and up to date. Mechanism must be kept in place to stop misuse and  modification of date published. The negative list must include data list that should not be published at all, keeping national security in mind. #clause11 if any pricing is there then general price cap must be defined. 
0 0 Though it is a welcome move involving transparency & clarity, India should first equip itself with fool proof cyber security from hackers & also should not definitely ape the West in computerizing all data since it not only results in unemployment but also unwanted machines & computers, wires being dug up out of the Earth, health hazards for persons using computers, dependence on electricity thru power generation plants & using up of water resources. Technology is always harmful than doing good. 
0 0 Its a welcome idea.  People will have close access in decision making policy framing for fair and transparent system and Nation building. 
0 0 Please make available guidance on disability accessible websites and communications to those outside the government system, like NGO.  Gov of India has bery good systems for this but only available to gov sites.  thank you 
0 0 #clause12 g, Interval for data update, for effectiveness, can be lower, say a month. That way, along with up-to-dateness the update volume would be low reducing some other issues. 
0 0 It is a great idea. All govt data must be easily accessible, it will not only increase transparency in governance but also reduce the no of RTI applications just for retrieving various govt database. 
0 0 Link the Aadhaar card with everything... Bank, Property, all govt related task. And make all the application online so when a person submit an acknowledgement to be given, and if it is necessary for the person to visit to the concerned official it can automatically generate the appoint time and date and the details of the officials to be met.  Pls appoint the expert on the fields rather than the person who is paying to become an administrative posts....

0 0 In Clause 7. Termination....concept of willful violator needs to be included(willful violator-a person who is violating the terms frequently and willfully to exploit the loopholes.) Punishments to the people who are using the data after termination of their licence. What if the person starts using the data, after termination , under some others name. Overall mechanism to judge a violator is missing.How to analyse the violation. Every aspect depends on what data GOI want to share. 
0 0 The access to data should not,in any way, be restricted to people from few professions. That defeats the purpose of this initiative. 
0 0 Hats of to Modiji for driving such transparent initiative..One more step toward digital India 
0 0 Accept the open data policy limited to only professional like advocate, auditors, doctors, customs and income tax commissioners, CII, Department of Industries and commerce.

0 0 I would appreciate this initiative by the gov because it increases transparency and makes the citizens aware of government functions , it gives the citizens some hope about government 
0 0 In my opinion its absolutely a great move as well a large step in information sharing but any Data in many ways  can be misused by miscreants who eagerly await for these opportunities. Before taking this LEAP.It is necessary that proven methods and steps are already in place to safeguard such vital information 
0 0 Nice Idea, but only browsing access should be allowed like Emails,google searches, f'book, messangers etc. downloading of attachment <10mb only should be allowed. in youtube only educational videos should be allowed. For security purpose first give login id as "aadhar card last four digit No." and password should be "OTP- via sms on their registerd mobile number" to avoid misuse of Open-Data. Thank u................................................................ vivek 
0 0 Each progress has its own pros ans cons.. This initiative will have  great value to make sound decision provided Data is correct.  Also this initiative only be fruitfull when all government data available at one portal means every Ministry Data should be at one place. Also clarification of required,  should be accepted through email and also someone should be available to answer in given time frame.

0 0 1. Document of every public expenditure/contract by Panchayat / ministry/ govt added ngo/institute should be uploaded 2. Documents can be searched by name of affected area/village and by pincode E.g. If a road or dam is build in my area, i can monitor it if I can search all projects by pincode. I would be able to see work order and actual work done 3. Every document should be give link for writing complaint anonymous or with name with attaching photos of work done or result of project

0 0 It is an huge step for development and sharing of knowledge across all people,use it for good implement.and i think with adhar card we can access all the information for open data concept. 
1 0 1. Appoint IT professionals to process the documents one who developed system. Present Govt.officers unwilling 2. All State and Central Govt. Department should have their own portals to display work done by each department and each officer concerned with public connection. 2. Email communication should be valid for getting the information from Govt. and seeking clarification. 3. Internal cross checking mechanism should exist within the govt department for verification from other department. 
0 0 Concept is no doubt good.but government should not post something that could be used in a wrong way where public safety would be affected. 
0 0 The need for a open Data platform is increasing with the explosion of Digital trends. While the government is taking an effort to streamline the process to formulate a set of rules that would govern the license of this Open Data Platform - caution should be taken to protect the privacy of it's citizens. No part of the this Open Data platform should expose the personal details of the citizens ! #OpenDataLicenceIndia, #OGDLicenceIndia, #OpenDataLicence #CautionDontExposePersonalData 
0 0 Great initiative. 1. There should be an option for a citizen to report an anomaly in data trend around him which would be a great way of finding out problem areas (both in terms of sector and geography). 2. Preferential access to Indian Citizens. 3. Verified access to data only - Access only after a verification process and tagging of each download by user ID. (every user will have a unique ID an all downloads will be tied to that ID which will help in better tracking usage and attribution)

0 0 Data generation should be encouraged at public points of care/contact like primary health care centres, Blocks or tehsils, district and medical college hospitals, irctc, police stations etc and should be made available to local policy makers like office of Mayor and Nagar Palikas to improve public services. There should be expression of a purpose within the data itself why data is being made available at this platform, for encouraging widespread use of the great effort

1 0 I think Aadhar card should be linked with all Bank A/C, Driving license, PAN No. and it should be smart card enabled with electronic chip. 
1 0 In a country which is always on the target of extremists and where political leaders do not think twice before giving it a cast / regional color for votes, the biggest challenge is how to save open data from  such misusers I suggest, there should be absolutely no data in absolute open. We can allow anyone and everyone to access the data, but at least he / she should be required to first verify their mobile number / email by sending a code followed by login That can save us from misuses 
0 1 Public Identity Data with their UID No. Aadhar No and details must be also available to Public at a single place. 
1 1 #Clause11 in NDSAP, you can have a provision of user accounts, where they purchase credits in pre-paid form, and then any particular data will deduct credits from that account as per usage by API means. This will ensure utility-level billing. 
0 0 Really a great initiative. I welcome this idea to get implement 
1 0 #Clause9 in NDASP, Kindly use ZFS for storage mechanisms, its open source and very stable with 100% integrity in storage. For OLAP, either can depend on open sourced versions of DBs or a No-SQL Database providing very flexible storage schema and future alterations. Also export needs to be handled by separate database servers as their function will be read-only. 
0 0 Open data is required for most accessed offices by public in any city.RTO , EB , Registrar , Pension , Universities , Banks , Goverment owned commercial shops , complex , Transport ,Railways , Toll booths contract details , & many other places that are used by public in day to day basis. 
1 0 What are the expenses per month for one MP, should be disclosed clearly and every citizen has right to know this.

1 0 Dear brothers all this digital service is very helpful but while making any mistake through government servant no action taken. i.e due to illegal construction in godhra my house is damage and we suffer too much with my small kids. i complain to collector and municipality but still they not visit or reply. so in this digital portal will any action on illegal construction owner. 
0 0 I believe access to this realtime data paves a way to come up with usecases to solve the current problems in diverse departments like finance,medical,education,agricultural,employement and food related data sets. As digital era we need more data,specific data to analyse present and past trends to predict/correct the future. Good move india ,go digital #OpenDataLicenceIndia, #OGDLicenceIndia, #OpenDataLicence, #GovernmentOpenDataUseLicenseIndia, #OpenGovernmentDataPlatform,

0 0 Hooters and sirens should be banned for all the vehicle except ambulance or fire fighting vehicles. Government vehicles have pressure and these horn create high pollution. If you want to control sound pollution then govt should start it from their own vehicles. 
0 0 It depends upon what type of data and the ,granularity of the data.Data can definitely do wonders , we can even form linkages with different type of data. I would like to see something been done 85 Forensics, it is such good idea to recognise things ,people using data sciences. 
0 0 Certainly this will help us to be more civilized, to know hidden or unknown opportunity for survival 
0 0 We need to map the lifecycle of each and every function in our society to figure out initiatives, I have added some in the attached document, recommend that the government select a panel of experts and allow for a workshop, share outcome in public to get opinions (from experts that are not politicians) and then add them to our Prime Minister's initiatives (So proud of Mr. Modi... first time I feel so proud when I speak of our prime minister), implement and share results... Jai Hind 
0 0 Suggestion is to just make every small government work digital, so that nobody has to go in govt. Offices for their work. Even paying fees should be digital. Thus showing such data at digital platform would be easy for government also. 
0 0 Great news.Definitaly it will help to all 
1 0 This is really good. It should be implemented as such that the government officials does not harass the general public for bribe. The data should be available freely and it should be passed on to interdepartmental confirmation. Do anything, but please stop this bloody corruption. We feel shame to enter any government office. 
0 0 If government make policies and decision on the basis of insights from data, it can help to have effective solutions to various problems. 
0 0 I think you should  also check the education status in bihar and try to implement more and more industries there..you should also now check the construction of nalanda university..this will be one more step in the development of bihar and their people..#nalanda university. 
0 0 Great news. Definitely it will help to all 
0 0 This kind of data will be very helpful in terms of survey about various things. This can help us keep track of progress, find social trends, track disease control etc.  Data sets about diseases, food consumption, national income, food production, market trends etc are welcome. Thinking in terms of machine learning and data science we can definitely think of some innovative ways to augment these data sets and produce statistics which may help in improving conditions in those situations. 
0 0 I would like Govt of India to Release Data of Govt. and Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes regarding the number patients admitted for treatment of diseases,injury,operation,birth each year and number of patients died, left, cured with reason. Also it is high time for govt of India to take control of School Fees of Private Education Bodies and ask them why they sell clothes, books & stationaries, health products in school or from school references. #OpenDataLicenceIndia, #OGDLicenceIndia, #Open

0 0 1.The effects of international accessibility of data should be kept in mind. 2. Data should be categorically divided and made available. Remote areas like villages,  panchayats should have a access to upload public welfare or other related data. 3. Provision for user login with id password should be chosen instead of direct access, though it may be difficult. 4. Feedback options for data should be there to report about the quality of data. Can include data benefit story sharing by people. 
0 0 Great news.  Definitely it will help to all 
0 0 Great, Please provisions for Blood Donors. 
0 0 Good initiative. Openness is the key to build our future. Government should focus on the change management - especially about the effective plan to engage the population as this is first of its kind drive. A change is successful only when that is felt by the people. 
0 0 OpenData is a great initiative. Can we get the data of all submissions done on MyGov 
0 0 Government of India has taken good initiative,OPEN DATA PLAT FORM,Which is more useful to MSMEs 
0 0 3 Things: 1. In-built reporting mechanism with time bound ticketing system. Current NDAP/NDAP Implementation is not very clear on the "time bound" thing. 2. More clarity on how purging/redaction of permissions will take place in case of misuse. Traditional media should be within the scope of this purging mechanism. 3. Better clarity on the APIs and data transfer speed/infrastructure to be used. Since most external data systems will want incremental data and that too at 1GBPS speeds! 
0 0 Please provide API based data sharing . 
0 0 In my View Govermnet implement a Singlr Id like AADHAR to apply Phone or Bank and alson e Mobile no attached with it -when any one do some small petty crime or Dues from Tax dept. it must appear his ID  and No Govt Benefit wouldn't be made available until he pays the GOVT. DUES and he shouldn't allow to go out from Country. In Saudi Arab I am staying last 10 years and they made it implemented so perfectly 
0 0 Technical points 1. Was there any sampling done on the data types and data sets that is going to be availble. 2. How did you get the DB sizing estimated without knowing the volume of source data that is going to be made available 3. How do you plan to clean up the data and validate its correctness 4. How do you plan to archive or purge this data whats the plan for such activities 5. How are you going to train the data contributors 6. Option for data captured  human intervention at source 
0 0 Great intiative. Also provide provisions for data such as medical report related to different diseases without disclosing the identity of patients to phd scholars for their research or some other provision where phd students  those are working in the area of ehealth can send request to govertment hospitals and medical institues for required data especially medical reports.so the time and effords would be saved.some time data collection become major challenge for phd students. 
0 0 General Comments: 1) This draft licence document seem to have been updated last in Feb 2014. Any reason that there were no further reviews and updates post to that. The reason being, the new government under the leadership of Mr. Narendra Modi our PM has different vision on the digital initiatives. 2)The implementation does not seem to have covering the probable phases of the new implementation and no plans have been indicated for the same. The roll out plan should cover different data source 
0 0 Transparency is good because most people are unable to avail facilities provided by government due to lack of knowledge. But we need a structured and systematic way to develop this system 
0 0 Technical comments: 1. Section 3.2: Consider supporting machine friendly open AVRO format (https://avro.apache.org/) 2. Section 6.3. Relational databases have scaling/capacity limits. Policy should encourage using open source No-SQL databases (like MongoDB, Cassandra etc). Also, datasets should provide REST/JSON APIs with No-SQL backend. SOAP not needed any more. REST/XML support should be optional. 3. I anticipate need for time-series databases in future. Please make provision in policy. 
0 0 Transparency is good because most people are unable to avail facilities provided by government due to lack of knowledge. But we need a structured and systematic way to develop this system 
0 0 Defence details of procurement or manufacturing should NOT be part of data.Educational policy, New developments, New proposed Industrial zones, various proposed highways, railway routes, Inter connectivity of rivers will be of much use to everyone. DP plan of city, town & their rules & Master plan of model town should be a part of Data.

1 0 Every District Hospital Should permit 50 Seats of Medical Course 30 Seats MBBS,5 Seats BHMS,5 Seats BAMS, 5 Seats for BNYS,3 Seats BUMS,2 Seats BDS,& 30 Seats for Nursing than it will solve Health problem in India. 
0 1 This is good and high taught initiative. My suggestion this platform should be used only our national interest only. My suggestion on BLACK MONEY which is the main cause of INDIAN POVERTY/DEVELOPMENT BLOCKAGE ELEMENTS. We INDIAN can now be only use Plastic Money i,e DEBIT CARD & CREDIT CARD. All purchase/payments should be through Cards only. From Payments of Bus Fare to Electricity bills etc. So in this way Indian Internal Black Money can be restricted but not stop 
0 0 Hi,My suggestion is to the MEA is that it should release a list of countries where Indian Normal Passport holders can visit to With VISA ON ARRIVAL,VISA FREE or EVISA facilities for tourism so that it could be easier for Indian frequent travellers to be informed and also other agencies like Henley and partners who do the judgement based on their flawed facts can get the original and verified report and plz try to improve INDIAN PASSPORT RANKING in the world atleast get it to over 60 countries. 
0 0 Open data have a good advantage in #education #bussiness #NGO's etc. So there should be open data but with security because  without security it can be used for other purpose which may be harmful 
0 0 Dear sir, this should be in form of limited uses because of unlimited access will allow hackers or unsocial use.Some mobile devices may have the feature of switching between Wi-Fi and other mobile data services such as GPRS, 3G/3.5G/4G. This switching would be triggered automatically depending on signal strengths of systems concerned, and may not be of notice to the user. If you want to avoid being unintentionally switched to these services (which are normally chargeable), you should disable 
0 0 Is it possible to create a single plateform to apply all the central government vacancies? Attach this plateform to our ADHAR CARD. We can fill our details on this unique plateform along with ADHAR CARD number. Further, we have to fill only ADHAR card number for applying any position. It will save a lot of time to fill the forms,also save the humongous no. of printouts. It will save our time, money, labour and natural resources. Vineet Kumar Singh IISc, Bangalore 
0 0 This should be confidential and should nit be open for public and comercial use without any law in favour of people.any misuse of data should be sttictly punishable.No compromise with   data security. 
0 0 A welcome step by the Govt. of India. On the other side, who defines what is open? and what is restricted? For example - currently in India there are no laws enforced to protect individual's personal profile such as Educational Information, Medical History etc etc How are these protected. What equivalents laws are there as related to U.S FERPA and HIPPA laws? 
0 0 imagine if electricity consumption data of a colony is available on internet many will find that his house having one ac is using more electricity that his neighbor's house having 10 ac. excellent idea.

0 0 Thanks a lot. It's a great initiative towards openness and transparency. 
0 0 I think its a good initiave but government should not compromise on security because now a days people are using digital things for wrong uses. 
1 0 It house tax of one colony is loaded on internet many will find that house tax of their small house is more than a bigger palace near by. Excellent Idea 
1 0 #Clause3: Data should be open and accessible in any format. Should be accessible for research and development but not for commercial usage. 
0 0 Its a good inititative by govt. But due care should be taken rgarding security of such data and one cant access private data through this platform. 
0 0 The initiative taken by Government India is really appreciable. Government of India can restructure the present education facilities and at the same time they have to give free food accommodation and fee concession for socially and financially backward class. But for employment opportunities all should be equal . 
0 0 #Clause5: Template also have to provided with the version No. if there is a version control of the data. #Clause6: Data provider has to endorse that he is authorised to provide the data. 
0 0 Sir,2.In applying for the central govt jobs there are fees exemption and travel allowances are given to some applicants like SC.ST.Women,ESM and Different abled persons by the name of social justice and is a noble move.But My suggestion is that if those are selected and getting jobs in central Govt offices,the  examination fees and travel allowances should be deducted from their first month's salary.And the exemption of the exam fees and travel allowances should be given only two attempts. 
0 0 Sir,1.There are a lot of Junoir commissioned officers retired from Army in their 40-50 age with supervision skills with UG/PG degrees  and they may be useful in middle management jobs in central govt.Without reservation in 'B' group, the young and Dynamic Professionals are compelled to sit idle in their homes upto 60 yrs of age. But the existing reservation policy,only 'C' group jobs are reserved for ESMs.So I request you for Deserving JCOs the reservation must be extended in 'B' group also. 
0 0 Great initiative by GOI. Please keep up the great work..!! I've query regarding #Clause3. Will this have the data related to Contracts been issued by PWD department or any other Government department and can the data published here be used in the Court of Law? 
0 0 Our Pm said every Mp will adopt one village spending mplads funds. what is the progress of 500+ villages if each MP at least have developed in these 2 years. 
0 0 See BJP is doing alright but our punjab is really suffering from drugs and lack of infrastructure. But SAD govt is ignoring it falsely advertising that no drugs are are damaging our state. I would like Modi to put some sense into our govt if possible and please improve government schools and colleges. 
0 0 THIS STEP TOOK US IN HASSEL FREE ENVIORNMENT AND REDUCE THE REDTAPPISM .SO WE APPRICIATE THE GOVT. SETP .BUT IN THIS ROW USER AND DATA SHOULD BE SAFE FROM HACKKERS AND OTHER SYSTEM GENERATED PROBLEMS 1 ..THERE SHOULD BE A COMMON HELPLINE NO FOR ANY ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO USERS . 2...THE USER SHOULD BE SAFE AND PRIVACY SHOULD BE MANTAINED IN THE PROCESS. 3 ..THERE SHOULD BE NO ROLE OF ANY CURROPT OFFICER AND SUBORDINATE FOR AUTHENTICATION OF ANY PAPER...ALL WORK SHOULD BE ELECTRONICALLY AC 
0 0 Appreciate and welcome the initiative by government. 
0 0 Seems like a good idea, but the reference format seems too long and is an eyesore. Also the protection of the user is omitted and the data user is protected in such a way that it undermines the faith I can put in aforementioned data.

0 0 #3 Use the  data by  combining  it  with  other data,  or  by  including  it  within  a  product/service,  for  all  commercial purposes. Does new company incorporated public data on MCA website combined with data available on advertising companies site like justdial be used for contacting intermediaries CA/ lawyers,etc for adding value/benefit to the new foreign companies and indirectly promote make in India concept.this of course Is for commercial purpose. 
0 0 #OpenDataLicenceIndia, a welcome move, ensures transparency and strengthens democracy 
0 0 If we really present as a trancperent  country than We can implement ERP application such as SAP for our whole system and we can inter link with each department and give limited access to end user mince public..  So, in that case we can increase use of plastice cards and virtual money use and we can decrease corruption... As a trial we can start a pilot project for small department in one district. We already have intelligent team in our IT department.

0 0 It's a good initiative in order to protect data and on the other hand to share data in lawful mannor. But as far as the draft is concerned, the fines and panelties are not defined clearly. 
0 0 Sir it will be immense help for them as it is very difficult to pay the fees, furthermore most of the students are not applying for less than 10 posts because they feel that if i pay for this i can not pay for big notifications. Hence, I urge you to take immediate necessary action. they will never forget you and i hope they definetely follow you sir. It is my personal experience as i have to look after my three brothers I hope it will be considered Regards Your one of the follower 
0 0 #Clause4: In subsection (e), for grammatical consistency change "If an already published data is" to either "If an already published data set is" or "If already published data are". #Clause5: For grammatical consistency change "Data has" to either "Data have" or "Data set has". #Clause7: In subsection (b), for avoidance of ambiguity, change "it reinstates" to "these rights will be reinstated". 
0 0 I appreciated government move on open data.This will be very helpful and transparency will be there. Government showing good governance and we must ensure security reasons for open data so that our information must be safe. 
0 0 clause #4.e. In case of wrong data being published either intentionally or unintentionally, there should be a provision by the NIC to delete it premanently unless correct data is made available. according to archival policy of NIC, if wrong data is entered and updated later the wrong information must not be kept permanent once authenticity is verified then old data has to be removed.All Departments, or any other agency which gathers data in its first version always makes many mistakes, hence. 
0 0 Respected PM JI, Sub:- One of the painful thing i want to in front of you is job application fees Sir, As you know lower middle class, backward class, economically backword class people only try for governament jobs majorly and upper class, jobholder childrens mostly look for civils and Group-I jobs. Here i want urge you that students feel more pain while paying application fees as they are already suffering for daily needs. So try to exempt job application fees 
0 0 #Clause4: yes its a very good initiative, for transparency and good governance 
0 0 recently, you have heard about the suspend of kolkata port trust chairman dut illegally bribe of 20 lakhs. But, againt it happens there. the is an interview on 20-21july2016 about the post of Asst Manager & Traffic Officer in which the interviewee asked the rubbish questions and after then, we got to know that they had eaten money to fill up the post for her relatives and just doing the "faltu kaam of taking interview of less than 60seconds". Maxm student feel sad but cant do anything. 
1 0 clause #4.d. NO WARRANTY. This is contradictory, public seek authentic and useful information for various purposes, but then if the people who are publishing data have this clause then the errors will be huge either intentional or unintentional. This will mislead as it is wrong info. So who ever is publishing the data must give the authenticity of such information else it will be considered as "Google Info", where anyone can publish anything and will fully default. 
1 0 Contd... I want to give example of transport systems in cities. If department,like BEST in Mumbai, can expose the location data of moving buses developers can use it to make such applications which people can use to make educated decisions about using buses. Their are multiple other scenarios where technology can make use of govt data for welfare of people. 
0 0 All political parties are spending money like an ocean without having any limitation and they don’t fall under income tax purview. Why a limit of expenses shouldn’t be fixed per annum basis for all political parties and on crossing the defined limit, the entire income of their account should be taxable. As per me, this would be a vital solution to eliminate corruption, because, unlimited expenses by the political parties are the root of major corruptions. 
1 0 Sir, I want to know what sort of data would be "open". I want that municipal corporations must be made available to citiziens so that citizens can come to know status of different projects like road construction, drainage systems repair etc. I also want that various departments like transport departments should expose their data via IT systems, so that technologists can make use of it to develop such softwares which common people can use. 
0 0 Hello  I am Neeraj Parsai  my small business man in MP Khargone. I have asked Indian army. Sir plz opened 1a/c Indian Army and published.1rs par Indians credit in a monthly weekly so Indian Army problems solved 
0 0 This is really a positive thing and useful but have to be careful at security. Because of hackers.. 
0 0 Never force people to learn/speak Hindi. India is for its Unity in Diversity. Let their regional language be alive. All Central government schemes are in Hindi, which is really unfair and getting failed in Non-Hindi states because they dont know the meaning and not interested in such Hindi names. After all, Hindi is not our National Language. Mind it. 
0 0 Definitely it is great thing...Any official can have access of it..no need to have papers with us... 
1 0 finitely, it is a good initiative, we have to make sure data should not be misused and Protected, if the data is sensitive. There are too many things that should know the public... So this should help a lot to the people to know more about GOVT policies and procedures and reduce the GAP between the people and GOVT. 
0 0 My simple suggestion to the Income tax Department is to try on trial basis on the following steps 1) Take services of retired people from various segment on Cluster Basis Like Mumbai Delhi Bangalore ...and concentrate to analyse the hidden Income from Doctors,Lawyers,Engineer's buisiness,Industurilist and other sectors by collecting the data from the available pool of information from PAN, BANK A/C ,LAND TRANSACTIONS, JEWELLERY PURCHASE., 
1 0 #Clause8 Hello sir this is great idea to deal with corruption , but all data are sensitive we need to hide under the security layer , using the Authentication and it should be common Authentication that every India have , UID ( Adharcard ) is best for Authentication . Even we need to Track the Log to see who are view which information from which UID. I am uploading a simple DFD to explain the Structure . 
0 0 nice move.... 
0 0 it is a good initiative, We are in support of the Government Open Data Use License. 
0 0 #Clause2 should include a definition on "open data", as this is the main topic we are dealing with. This is great initiative Government of India is undertaking, and will help further enhance in economic development for the people. 
0 0 Definitely, it is a good initiative, we have to make sure data should not be misused and Protected, if the data is sensitive. There are too many things that should know the public... So this should help a lot to the people to know more about GOVT policies and procedures and reduce the GAP between the people and GOVT. 
1 0 Lot of Government department heads using and publishing Gmail ID mostly as their official mail IDs. I think it is high time that these has to be stopped immediately. I have my UIDAI Aadhar card digitally signed by a digital signature using gmail ID. It is pathetic, Nandan Nilekani being an IT company CEO allowing this is very deplorable. This I think is a very big security threat.I think data should be provided to all citizens. But Open Data contains very prehistoric. No data is upto date. 
0 0 Any rules, regulations or circulars. If it is creative and productive for the people and the nation is always very good. 
0 0 It is a good initiative for making the data transparent among public, As with such projects,only we can decrease the corruption within the government departments. Now a days with the implementation of aadhaar project, the corruption regarding several categories had been decreased a lot. Also suggest the government for a PUBLIC FILE TRACKING SYSTEM(Like courier)for each and every department so that the public can aware of the status of each and every file submitted in the government departments. 
0 0 The definitions (Clause 2) should be amended to: - Update 'Data Provider' to 'Data Custodian'. This will reflect the absolute ownership of master and right to distribute with corresponding custodian. Like Fixed Asset Data is with municipal authority of their jurisdiction and they are the custodians. - Add 'Data Contributor' for entities that can contribute to custodians database. The custodians will have rules laid down for verification and validation of data. This will enable data enrichment 
0 0 It's going to a good opportunity for researchers from all areas. 
0 0 #Clause6: Whatever you do, it should be treated equally with general public, government officials and all political leaders. If it is discriminated with general public, it means we are compromising somewhere in this law. only national security should be exempted (even prime minister should not be exempted). 
0 0 #Clause6: a. "Personal information" should be broader in context, change it to "PERSONAL DATA". Information provides context for data, but personal data itself must be in the exemption list. 
0 0 Good that Gov is taking care of personal Data however fair competitive policy should (buy in from usage of data) be maintained while sharing the data. Users will not publish that data at any cost. User of Data should sign a contract that they will be liable if any data or information leaks and goes to bad hands. Data use license shouldn't be restricted to big players or influential people only. Open Data should be shared under strict need only as media players misuse this data many a times. 
0 0 #Clause6:Whatever you do, it should be treated equally with general public, government officials and all political leaders. If it discriminated with general public, it means we are compromising somewhere in this law. only national security should be exempted (not even prime minister should be exempted). 
1 0 #Clause6 - (b) It is not clear what is the guideline or reference doc. that talks about what data the provider(s) is not authorised to license. 
0 0 No doubt it is a good initiative. The data should be accessed via web services and the party who will access the data should have the license from govt. and end user should access data via proper UID authentication, and if possible it should be non editable or the person cant save that data. 
0 0 Open Data use License is a welcome effort. But caution must be kept in the kind of data which is shared. Govt. may not share data on affairs such as defence, nuclear,foreign but areas of public interest like infrastructure, public health, education, policy, Courts with judgements, finance, ratings of service providers on telecom, health, education, travel, building construction etc could be put on this platform. This data available could be used by public under license for particular purpose. 
0 0 Y we are giving allowance to MLAs mp and vip already they get it d incomes 2)for developing Bldg so many permission required y we not open 1 window so transparency will get 
0 0 From research perspective if its feasible then kindly add the research based clause, on that i may suggest is: #Clause2(a): In the definition of 'data', 'research paper or research related statistics' shall also be included. 
0 0 The response data should be in json format for easy and efficient transfer between parties. The failover mechanism available. The efficient security architecture using public/private key and effective authentication mechanism The meaningful/understandable error responses

Govt. may not share data on affairs such as defence, nuclear,foreign but areas of public interest like infrastructure, public health, education, policy, Courts with judgements, finance, ratings of service providers on telecom, health, education, travel, building construction etc could be put on this platform.This data available could be used by public under licence for a particular purpose. 
0 0 Once a person find something he will naturally have quarry but from my experience ia that most of the ministers including chief ministers of either e-mail address are not listed/ wrong address is given on the web due to which e-mails can not be send. In recent past several mail sent to Chief Minister have bounced like Delhi, MP, Gujrat, Maharastra etc. Even ths e-mail address of PM is not listed. It is not necessary for PM to see all e-mails and some Secretary level officer can take action. 
0 0 Thanks for giving the opportunity to share the suggestions. 1. It should be accessible by all educated Indians with free of cost 2. Authentication should happen with the combination of Aadhaar & mobile number OR PAN number & Mobile Number. then only security will be in place 3. Users visited or accessed information needs to be questioned why it was done. Like feed back system so that it will be useful for enhancements. 4. Indians who are part of anti social activities must keep tracked 
0 0 As a responsible citizen I will never allow my Personal information to be used for any purpose except for legal /economic/ medical purposes to be shared with within government agencies leave aside private individuals and concerns. Any such sharing should require permission of in individual as an adult of sound mind /health or someone who is the parent/legal caregiver of such an individual as part of  a personal information sharing agreement. 
0 0 #Clause3 (a) There should be a fee for the user, it should not be free of cost. Through that you may have the original details of the users otherwise many fake user will take grant of this and it should not be allowed world wide, if it is for Indians let the access should be India only. Thank you 
1 0 I expect following from the open data - 1. Must be in XML format 2. Should have API for the users to access the data. 3. Must be provided only by licencing the user. This licence could be FREE or maybe charges based on the data. 4. The open data should be created for all the government department. I suppose this itself is a BIG project, and the government must invite not just the BIG companies but also the small small IT companies to take part into it. 
0 0 Good initiative, however "Open Data" might be misused. If there is a option to have a check on the misuse then its good else may cause security lapse. 
0 0 Excellent initiative...#OpenDataLicenseIndia 
0 0 Good initiative by the Government and hope will work for the betterment of nation. 
2 0 I would say that it depends on the data that the Government is willing to share... It is Govt.'s prerogative to decide which data top share in open platform... Also, Open Data Licence will have its own security challenges.. and There are many instances where personal data has been misused.. So I would caution the Government against the use of such platform without giving adequate thought to which data is being shared. 
0 0 Good Initiative #OpenDataLicenceIndia ! 
0 0 #OpenDataLicenceIndia Hello, I appreciated with this. OpenData is very good campaign of Indian government. 
0 0 This is a good initiative.We are in support of the Government Open Data Use License 
0 0 The open access data must not be traceable to individuals. Like my electricity bill is OK to share just no one should know it is mine, this way we understand how households use resources and privacy is maintained. Goodluck! 
0 0 This initiative will be more powerful than RTI Act. The transparency in every government activity will bring confidence among the citizens and at the same time will enhance the public accountability of the  government servants. Corruption will be totally controlled by total transparency in each and every government department. The main tools for any government servant  to involve in corruption activities is hiding the facts and showing unnecessary reasons. Government initiative is appreciable. 
1 0 #OGD This would be a good initiative. But this should make sure that the sensitive data disclosing which could cause severe problems in our country should be kept away from this initiative. 
1 0 इन २ साल में अपने बहुत अच्छा कार्य किया इत्ता किसी सर्कार न कभी कर पायेगी न करेगी? सलाह के तौर पे - १-भारत जैसे देश में नियम कानून मजाक है जो भी चाहे पैसे फेका और कानून से खेल लिया सदियों निकल जाते है इंसाफ के लिए जिससे ये पता चलता है की कुछ नही होने वाला ? २-हमारे प्रधान मंत्री या राष्ट्रपति जैसे प्रठिस्तित लोगो पे तिपड़ी न करना जैसा कानून .. ३-शिक्षा तो व्यवसाय बना है ? ४-स्वाश्थ तो सर्कार को कहे या किसी और को मजाक बना लिया है ? मेरे सलाह से ये जरूर मजबूत होना चाहिए 
0 0 Wow. Many academic researchers who are doing secondary data research can do with this. Bus transport data, LPG supply, natural resource utilization, wages, pricing, weather, etc are used by academicians to publish fruitful suggestions to the government. Till now they are accessible only a few economic data only. Dear sir, kindly ensure correctness of data and data collection methods in govt organizations. Due to few people lethargy, some data leads to misinterpretations. 
0 0 Sir, This is very good initiative to build open bridge between public & Government. I am really grateful to Government for good governance programs like #DigitalIndia, #swachhta_abhiyan. I would like to suggest one thing that please do impose restrictions on cigarettes and all unhealthy things and mostly near educational area. I assure that this would be biggest changing part of #swachhta_abhiyan. Thank you #OpenDataLicenceIndia 
0 0 #OpenDataLicenceIndia Hi Sir openData is very good campaign of Indian government. I appreciated. 
0 0 Firstly, the "Data" open or closed must have limitations. Personal Privacy has to be respected. The "Data" has to be defined for distribution purpose. What constitutes "open data"? Who gives it? What purpose the open data is anticipated to serve? Without these definitions, it is not logical to ask even suggestions. Personal Particulars, Name, caste, religion, income, assets, phone numbers, email, geographical location of stay, etc., cannot be part of any open data. 
0 0 How is this different from RTI  query? 
1 0 I believe that the NCERT,CBSE books and State board Books should be allowed to distributed by the private players at some marginal rate or free. As of now, these books cannot be distributed in digital form by any private company. Request for making the educational books published by government available for circulation by Private firms for business. Additionaly the digital content repository should be made open and the students should be made aware to use them. 
1 0 Dear Sir, Ap kayi project or programme kafi achche chala rahe hai. But Sir apko hamare desh k farmers ke growth and development k bare mai sochna chahiye kyuki WO hamare desh ke kafi important part h or bina unke  cities ke development  ka koi faida nhi hai.

1 0 The idea is very good. My only suggestion is that the word license seems inappropriate, since no one is applying for the data.It may be named as "National Data in Public Domain (NDPD." 
0 0 Great Initiative and waiting to see interaction among people of India across the globe to build future of India.

0 0 I am a Fan of Modi Ji's Stature so anything and everything so I am always in favor. Apart from that, Guns are held by criminals in the same manner confidential information. Though i dont know the content of Data but access to all would mean a lot genius minds in our country, who would surely make the best use out of it. 
0 0 #OpenDataLicenceIndia Hi Sir openData is very good campaign of Indian government. I appreciated. And I would like to add one more api in Open Data like about every person has a unique data Id as aadhar card no. Whenever we hit api using aadhar card no then we can see limited data about those person or all data related those person. limited data means :- Name : Phone no: Age: Status: live or dead Email : Address: Thanks 
0 0 Its really very good initiative. #OpenDataLicenceIndia, #OGDLicenceIndia, #OpenDataLicence In india we should same kind of internet packages and rates. 
0 0 Data shall be maintained  in perfect integrated manner with live running dtabases 
0 0 It's a great initiative as transparency is the best way to eliminate confusion. One suggestion regarding #2- Data: currently all the information of citizen are obtained through Aadhar/voter ID/Passport or many other viable data source. My suggestion is to have an aggregated-singular source of data of each person. Eg: connecting information like birth certificate, voter ID, driver's license, Passport(if present), tax payment(if a tax payer) and many such information which have certified documents 
0 0 This is a great initiative, have used open data before and is extremely beneficial for informed decision making. What is needed: More robustness in data collection, caveats for data collected, data from all levels of geography (At least till district), wider consultation on what data should be collected, and lastly a more interactive platform for data usage and sharing 
0 0 For this, speed of Internet throughout India, has to be increased manifold & the charges to be decreased drastically. THEN ONLY, ALL PUBLIC / AAM AADMI ( & even a BPL citizen ) CAN EFFECTIVELY USE THIS (without wasting time / going to Govt. office losing his salary, time & energy ). 
0 0 Its very good initiative by Govt. This will definitely open new avenues for business and services. Better data will give better insights& analysis and may lead public projects in right direction. 
0 0 It is a very good initiative & benefit every.. I am really proud of My Govt.. 👍 
0 0 Kindly include more variables and indepth datasets. Create a public forum for people to contribute insights from the data and possibly use that insights (given that insights make statistical sense) to improve governance. 
1 0 Pls. make the schools of local villages as information center. Teachers and Principals in schools have lot of spare time also being literates give them computer, printer & internet access. They are at the point where Govt.can convey to villagers of all their schemes without much of extra cost. 
0 0 We must have a common platform to share each kind of real time data that is generating continuously by different means like some apps. Different research centres, IITs and universities who are working in the field of big data should manage and promote it. 
0 0 It is a good initiative.it will be useful for researchers a lot 
1 0 Dear prime minister, why contractual lecturers are getting consolidated salary( which is less than a sweeper or a peon's salary). 
0 0 PM  श्री मोदी जी को नमस्कार ! मैं आज आपसे ग्रामीण क्षेत्र के बारे में कुछ कहना चाहता हूँ सर आपसे निवेदन है कि आपने डिजिटलीकरण के सम्बन्ध में बहुत अच्छा काम किये है सेलूट है आपको, आपने हर चीज को डिजिटल कर दिया है हर चीज ऑनलाइन हो रहा है जिससे काफी हद तक भ्रष्टाचार काम हुआ है लेकिन सर ग्रामीण क्षेत्र जंहा पर आज भी इन्टरनेट नहीं पहुँच पाया है वे तो इसका लाभ नहीं ले पा रहे है बल्कि इससे उनका और नुकसान हो रहा है डिजिटलीकरण के कारन उन्हें कोई भी काम दूर- दूर जाकर करना पड़ रहा है | 
0 0 #OpenDataLicenceIndia: Great Initiative #Clause2 , SubClause a : The data should also include the methodology or the framework that was used to collect data, which helps in the individual to use the data or not. #Clause4, Sub Clause f : Continuity of Provision: The agency can atleast put a future date till which it will provide the data. For Ex. It can say the data will be updated on regular intervals till March 2022. 
0 0 Its good initiative ! 
0 0 Very good initiative, government being transparent would help common people access to data anytime. 
0 0 My dear .       prim minister Deshe sabse jyada jarurat pine wale pani ko save karna hai magar Hume har jarurat ke liye pani chahiye jaise kheton Ki sichayi pine ka pani .iske liye hamare pass naharon ka network chahiye haha se hat jarurat ke liye pani ko liya ja sake ..mujhe apne desh ke priminister par pura wishwash hai 
0 0 I'm in support of this #OGDIndia 
1 0 #4 Terms of use of data: User should not be allowed to distort or manipulate data from the provider, if they are further distributing the original data.  Original data should be available for inspection to downstream users #6a Exemptions: How do you propose to handle "personal data" that is matter of public record #6d If other intellectual property is involved, why is it listed as open data?(should not be) . It should be replaced by "no patent, copyright or trademark license for open data" 
0 0 Be sure about that government should not loose their control on economy affairs after opening the data for all. The predictions for the same seems that some private commercial companies would we beneficial instead of general public or govt dept/org. As per my suggestion it should not recommended. Indirectly public survey outcomes we are going to providing them. For full details in context to above I can send separately. 
0 0 This is welcome step. But, for this to be "More Effective", YOUR FEEDBACK ON OUR SUGGESTIONS REQUIRED-(whether our suggestion practical or not / whether can be implemented or cannot be implemented & the time frame, etc.). 
0 0 Good Move by Government. I am favoring this step by government. It brings more transparency and helpful for people of India. 
0 0 I appreciate the IDEA, but I am not sure of how far this would be successful. Sorry, but before #OpenDataLicence, we need the proper, smooth, flawless internet connectivity. With 1.25 billion people, the data speed availability & usage is disappointing. To reach & communicate someone, one requires the mode, for which internet plays the key role. So, I would be happy, if internet is made available first. #OGD 
0 0 Important department information in general should be as bullet points, though huge data is available for a detailed study, when poeple are in real need of emergency to fulfill their needs at that time, it will be too heavy. So please arrange bullet points on frequently used services like Police, Health, Traffic Regulations, etc to make it convenient for general public with * terms and conditions. 
0 0 It's a good Initiative 
0 0 Good Move from government, it definitely facilitates transparency and public participation. 
1 0 It is sure that this project can improve the transperency. But the question is, If this project becomes an ACT then is it going to be implimented or just it is going to stay on paper only.? Why I am asking is, Many state govts have already been started making thir data available on corresponding gvot departments websites. Which means the can b verified at any point of time. But when a citizen takes a copy that data and goes to anther govt dept, that Dept is seeking for so-calld ORIGIANL data. : 
1 0 This is a much needed facility. I hope demographics data and stats too will be made available. You may also want to share health statistics. However, access should be restricted by Adhaar id and mobile OTP. 
1 0 PM श्री मोदी जी से निवेदन करना चाहता हूँ कि नाटक / दिखावा बंद करें और अपने ही स्लोगन मिनिमम गवर्नमेंट मैक्सिमम गवर्नेस पर फोकस करें . आम आदमी के जरूरत की पटवारी , पंचायत ,नरेगा सम्बन्धी सभी काम ओन लाइन व समयावधि में हों इसका बन्दोबस्त करें . स्मार्ट सिटी , बुलेट ट्रेन नहीं कृषि कार्य व पीने के पानी की सुचारू व्यवस्था करा दें जल प्रबन्धन आज भारत की बड़ी आवश्यकता हें श्रीनगर से भोपाल तक बाढ़ आ रही और पश्चिमी राजस्थान में जल संकट इस पर ध्यान देना जरुरी हें. लिखने का झुनझुना पकडाना बंद कीजिये 
1 0 This initiative is really good, the data provided can be used for several new policy designing also in services and manufacturing industries by a way of innovation; I already have an idea but that requires DATA from the govt. department from each and every distt. in India for the execution and if I am not wrong with my inception of IDEA it would save nearly about 100 of Lakhs to the govt on monthly basis. Would request to plz open up this platform as soon as possible 
1 0 It will be very useful for young India .. 
1 0 Great Intiative..Kudos to Modi Sir and his intiatives!! One Suggestion is have multi factor authentication on such systems. 
1 0 This is a much needed initiative. But I am not clear on how it would be implemented, definitely everyone needs to be linked with Aadhaar (mandatory) and an email id and maybe cellphone for OTP. The Government needs to start track of every single rupee and person, which in turn will improve law and order, reduce corruption, etc. it's possible with Aadhaar. 
0 0 It's a great work.. 
0 0 I support this but it should be accessible only to Indian citizens 
1 0 It is really good initiative. But we have some concerns in the internet. For Example consider Birth Certificate download in Corporation site. Any one can download any of the person Birth Certificate which is a security threat.For doing this, we need to have atleast Everyone with AADHAR Card and Everyone with Mobile. If they have Mobile phone,then only we can OTP Level Security atleast. Till Everyone got Aadhar card and Mobile phone linked with that. Implementing this project is a security issue 
0 0 It is a good initiative but it should be accessible only to Indian citizens within India. A change in #3 paragraph. 
0 0 #Clause2: Definitions - In sub clause(s) b. "Information"means constraint, communication, control, data, form, instruction, knowledge, meaning, mental stimulus, pattern, perception, and representation 
0 0 I support this

0 0 Appreciable step by the Govt.  We support it. 
0 0 Clause#6: In sub-clauses d, add another point on data that is protected by  Technological Protection Measures (TPM) such as watermarks. Such data is protected by anti-circumvention Laws in the 2012 amendment to the Copyright Act. 
0 0 Much needed. Everyone will able to get micro information. Transparent governance 
0 0 This is good step 
0 0 I think this is a good step and I support this. +1 #OpenDataLicenceIndia, #OGDLicenceIndia, #OpenDataLicence, #GovernmentOpenDataUseLicenseIndia, #OpenGovernmentDataPlatform 
0 0 #Clause5: Their is a need of 2 templates, Offline use of data and Online use. The template is way too lengthy for Online purpose. Suggestion for Online Version: As it is a 'data' no need to use that word as first word. Also if the URL is already there, explicitly stating 'Source' doesn't serve any purpose. “Published by [Name of Data Provider], [Name of Data]. ([date of Publication :dd/mm/yyyy]). [DOI / URL / URI] under OGDL-I[URL of Open Data License – India]” 
0 0 #2 Definitions: Market Research usage of data should be mentioned clearly and comprehensively. This should be done by taking MRSI (Market Research Society of India) as well as ESOMAR-compliant agencies like IMRB, Nielsen, TNS for ensuring that market research activities are not hampered by loopholes in definition #6 The interests of Market Research companies should be considered here. In some cases we need to collect as well as share personal data of respondents and data sources. 
0 0 Yes I support of open data & it should be available to everyone at no cost. 
0 0 Nice idea.In this day Government of India is trying to pramote small scale industries.or MSME sectors. Government should secure that MSME unit could get the Raw material at Reasonable Price so that ihat they can compete the market. 
0 0 There is immense shortage of technical staff across all departments, ministries and institutions. Aren't we aware that the Patent office doesn't even have a website to be able to adhere to #PartIIISection2 #MyGov #OGDLicenceIndia 
0 0 Definitions  (#2) need to include 'Personally identifiable data' and this type of data needs to be excluded from the data that is released. Ethical use of data and privacy of individuals has to be made mandatory. Use an ombudsman who ensures all ministries comply with these aspects. Prohibit the direct sale of data (processed or not) once acquired by a third party. Involve a scientist who actually knows about ethical use of information (e.g. an HCI person, ethnographer, medical researcher) 
0 0 This document is good and covers all aspects of data sharing.Safeguards have been taken, however, it may be advisable to not allow data to be used for court cases against the govt. 
1 0 I think it is a two way sword which harms and does good both side by side as population in india is of various types say graduate high school mid level (i think people reading this got my idea) making data open source should be done under certain restriction as spammers and hackers always have eye on this value things which in turn can be harmful causing money frauds identity frauds etc.However data being open source can help in getting rid of police verification as in foreign. 
0 0 I support this. every one need to know what govt is doing ..? 
1 0 #OGDLicenceIndia Definitely a Good move. But security is required to have personal details of the ppl. Like DOB, Name, Address. As now with that data others can make big harm to any body. 
0 0 It's a very brilliant idea which can also protects us from any corruption or scan if and only if the system becomes transparent totally. Each and every transaction is shown with proper accuracy. These governments sites should be secure because the data is important and if list so it will be a disaster.#Opendatalicence #mygov #KUVER 
1 0 Happy to have received information on an open platform. This is a great initiative and shall definitely reduce decent amount of paperwork saving crores of Rupees. Here are the concerns that I have and would like to present the same. #Clause6: Since it is an open platform, anybody in the country can view the details of anyone. I strongly recommend that there shall be a way to track who's viewing whom even in case of personal information. Especially if one is renting a house. 
1 1 I am an NRI. I have a view that all kind of Reservations in School , Colleges and institute should be abolish. A general candidate with 150+ marks can not get admission in institution like IIT where as candidate in reserve category gets admission with 50 marks. Is this fare for the future of the kids.Being an NRE we bring lots of foreign exchange to the country . If Govt. Want to Help the reserve people give them free schooling,books etc.but donot do un justice to the General category poors 
1 0 Pl refer NDSAL Cl.6 Exemptions and add: 1.Process control networks of sensitive installations like refineries,defence systems,power,etc. 2.Data obtained through illegal/malafide sources. 
0 0 great initiative to get track the thing on common man fingers, and there action and demand in discussion on fact and figures 
0 0 i am completely in support of open data & it should be available to everyone at no cost. This is a wonderful initiative and I would like to congratulate the government for the same. 
0 0 www.jamosnews.com Sir I Appreciate Your Efforts Following Also Needs Your Attention [1]Starters Are Asked 3 Years Experience + Rs 50 Lakh Balance Etc Sir Is It Possible For A Starter 
0 0 The Web portal for #OpenDataLicenceIndia is really appreciative, The granularity of information provided is good. Below things need to be considered: #Clause9 Information should be available in multiple Language,like information related to agriculture, this information will reach to end user only when user can read in his own language where he can read it and user for his reference. 2) The information still needs to be in more organised form,I found the UI is bit cluttering. 
0 0 Also as there is intended transparency and right to information from the government end ,they should also enforce the private companies to be open and transparent ,otherwise it will be a lost cause. 
0 0 I support #GovernmentOpenDataUseLicenseIndia. Nothing less is expected from a government in this age of data and information. I support and welcome the transparency and right to information initiative by the government of India. But I would like to point out that though having information regarding policies based on taxation specially service tax ,the common man is struggling against private companies who are charging variable service charges and taxes. The government should monitor these things

0 0 As long as no personal data is not published. It needs to be generalised data and not individual or personal based. 
0 0 The digital website and works is a good idea but the Maharashtra govt website has too little space for upload of images. This needs to improve on Aaple Sarkaar web portal. I couldn't find contact for web portal so could not raise this issue there. 
0 0 #OpenDataLicenceIndia, #MyGov Good Initiative by Govt. of India. I support this. But any measures have been taken so that this information will not/Cannot be misused? 
0 0 Good initiative , I support this but Data should be authentic & free from all kinds of liabilities like DND & all , So any one can use it to grow their business . 
0 0 I support this, good initiative by the Govt. Only thing is that the data should be valid, meaning it should be current data not 2 months back data, which has no importance to anyone. 
0 0 Safe dispensation of data ensuring proper security is a welcome gesture. It improves peoples' participation in the administration. At the same time collection of innovative suggestions alone is not enough. It should be compiled analysed and a decision taken. The person must be informed of the proceding and how such an idea can be developed further. 
0 0 I am in favor of establishment of a national database. In place of many Identity cards issued by Government from time to time (like PAN card Aadhaar Card, Voter ID card etc, only one card should be issued. This will help to maintain a single database and identification of duplicate ID cards. On that basis, action can be taken against the persons misusing government as well as public money. If a single database for all citizens is available, many problems can be solved. 
0 0 Great initiative, This will help many startups and small companies go grow. 
2 0 #clause8 : the software must not contain pop-up ads and add one Also it must be supported by all latest browsing software. It is also required to have help menu with screen short for easy understanding of software with in the help menu of the online software And last but not the least the site must be bug free and fast responding. 
0 0 This is a good initiative. I support for this. Open data should be available to bring innovation to solve our problems. I would like to bring proper computer education for school children and also the government should start using FOSS applications and linux systems in order to cut down the cost of computing needs. 
1 0 I appreciate the efforts of Government of India in taking such an initiative. The data regarding the policies/decisions/budget/any other relevant material that is to be made available online is a great initiative. But if the public gives some suggestions regarding the uploaded material then it has be taken into consideration and those suggestions should be implemented over the policies or decisions that are taken, then only this initiative will be success else it is of invain. 
2 0 The #Clause4 #Sub Clause f: Continuity of Provision Data has value only when it is current. The #Clause4.f should be modified and we should see to it that providing data periodically is binding to all the participating entities (government offices, state governments...etc.) Also, integration of the information systems of these institutions with the Open data Platform should be initiated so that all the relevant data under the purview of License updated frequently and periodically. 
2 1 Sir, My greatest suggestion is to ban the paper currency and start payment through plastic money, net banking etc. 
1 1 I am really happy with Mobile number portability has been introduced in India. On the same terms i would like to request we should have a system where one can use his/her own private vehicle in other state. I agree this is okay in North India or NCR. But its really tough in South India like in Bangalore and Hyderabad. People transferring from one state to another does not mean that they would buy a new vehicle or pay life time road tax. we should have some alternative to this. 
2 1 We should remove paper currency in India and instead start using electronic currency. This would eliminate black money issues. Introduce Rupee card just like we have Visa / Master and distribute machines to all small / large vendors even to very small vendors / retailers so that it can be used widely. This way 1 paise and 2 paise will also come into use which we unfortunately had stopped. 
0 0 I definitely appreciate this initiative.I would suggest the government put in place strong updating mechanism. So much of government data available is simply just out of date. Make sure all departments joins this initiative.To extract any use information out of data in a country complex as ours, we need data from multiple departments. 
1 0 It’s really a good initiative to air development related data for public purposes and business uses. It definitely empowers people, maintain transparency and make the concerned accountable. Here, we want to mention about our intervention about data management and presentation for risk-informed decision making and planning for sustainable development. A document is being uploaded for reference. More detail discussion and presentation can be done on this RIDP system if the opportunities are given. 
2 0 We should introduce online voting system in India. I have a vote in UP but since i stay in Telangana State, i am not able to cast my vote in any election. I believe lot of people are staying in different states. for Instance when France had elections, people from Pondichery voted from India for France (different country) and i being in India cant vote since i am in different state. Please introduce some online system for voting in India. 
1 0 No doubt that this Government has brought back the required Revolutions in terms of Developments & Transparencies. The Old Baburaj is coming to an END. As we are developing, Infrastructure Developments needs to be worked upon with much more transparencies. Its a big challenge that the Government has to face. Currently all the infrastructure developments are being built on BOT basis which involves a lot of funds. Request the statistics to be open for all regarding this Collections & timelines. 
1 0 I will suggest to the government to rapid the progress in the project of Digital land owners account. Which will give the transparency in providing the right information about the owners of the land and also the also the number of lands in the name of particular person .It will certainly reduce the crimes and frauds.It will also provide the data of human beings without lands.Government should make a policy of fixing the limit to which a person can own a land.Thank you. 
1 0 As a researcher, I find this initiative of making data available for research as the need of the hour. My suggestion would be making traffic congestion data at the important points of a city available to facilitate a better traffic management and prioritization of road construction/maintenance projects in urban areas. Also, it would be nice to have real time weather and pollution datasets for each cities available to the public. Installing sensors in public buses could help doing that. #MyGov 
1 0 I am a senior citizen who has worked more than 30 years in a Government Of India Undertaking in the shipbuilding industry, as senior officer. After retirement I get a meager pension of Rs.1300/- . The  contributory PF which I get is used up and I have to live on my Fixed deposit interests. All my life I have paid income tax. Now after retirement the government keeps on reducing bank FD interests and keeps on increasing the income tax payable.The Government should help us in some way.

0 0 After viewing this URL http://bit.ly/opendatalicence I thought that the Digital India has not enough infrastructures and developments for its own services. They are relying on third party technologies and services for data. Now Indian private sector is providing the digital/cyber services to all over world using Indian talent in their sector within India. But Digital India is still far lag behind to achieve this and use of own Indian talent. But something is better then nothing. 
1 0 8)This party strict inspection for every road/street lights/sewarages and how much money state government has spent on them must reflect publically on center govt website as well as in state government website. 9) Online complaint should be thre which directly should be connected to High Courts/Local courts/consumer courts and if no govt employee reply to complaints Court can directly take decision whether to impose penalty or remove the councilor/state govt of that area/state from their post. 
0 0 In our NGO, Samporna Swaraj Foundation we have developed a Portal Technology for bringing Transparency and Accountability in the operations of a Gram Panchayat. We had requested the citizens ration card data from the Food & Civil supplies to be uploaded into the Public software, but it was not given easily. How do we create a policy that will provide access to this data. 
0 0 4)There should be strict call centers for Municipal Corporation/Electricity/Flood/Telephone services/Hospitals. 5)No govt employee can use govt vehicles, they should use their own vehicles for traveling and offices. 6)No red/blue light cars should be there except emergency vehicles. 7)Government Friendly environment must be there, as police behavior is now like they are everything in this earth, politicians behaviour like they are bigger than god. 
0 0 1) Income tax should be collected by State government and 20% state government should keep as separate for emergency in other as well as for same state. 2) There should be one local tax in all over India to avoid more corruptions. 3) Mr. Arun Jately has taken good step for 45% penalty on undeclared income before 30th September but to make undeclared income in white there should be no penalty so that hidden income come into rotation in India so that other price hike can get down. 
0 0 my point of view every data should be aware in public dealing. so that public can get information about our government. and also all matter should be transparent to everyone . if all matter should be aware, they will know all legal matter that what is wrong and what is right for my government ? 
0 0 I appreciable step taken by the government of India by open data use license. Data and statics generated from data, plays a crucial role in the development and innovation of the new products and services and especially beneficial for the budding entrepreneurs . It should be accessible by one and all within the Indian territory.And When we discuss public data, i believe we should have real time status of all infrastructure projects be available for public view as well. Good to see this India 
0 0 It should be done as early as possible .  . It is a bloody good thing as we can access other countries data for free but not ours 
0 0 I think the initiative is great. One point of caution though - the restriction access should be clearly and concisely defined and there should be sufficient mechanism to ensure data integrity. There are plenty out there who will look to plunder this data and use for anti social propagandas. We should ensure that this development should bring only positives for our society and economy. 
0 0 I am so glad to hear an initiative of the Govt for transparency. I am all in favor of it. But I would also like to make a suggestion as to the restriction of usage of such information. As we know the crime against the Govt an d public and acts of terrorism has been on an increase, so I guess there should be some restrictions as well, like certified log-in to access the information or strict actions for such crimes. 
0 0 It’s really a good initiative to air development related data for public purposes and business uses. It definitely empowers people, maintain transparency and make the concerned accountable. Here, we want to mention about our intervention about data management and presentation for risk-informed decision making and planning for sustainable development. A document is being uploaded for reference. More detail discussion and presentation can be done on this RIDP system if the opportunities are given. 
0 0 Dear Sir, One and a half year ago I submitted from 5 Suggestions from Vadodara. No Response, No Action till date. At present I am at Bodeli - 391 135. Hear also Garbage is fired by Corporation Employed Sweepers. This is Not Zero Pollution. Kindly change approach & Watch it. Waiting for immediate Action in All INDIA at least in BJP Governing Orginations. Regards from J H Patel 
0 0 Peace cannot be taught..it has to come from within..it must be felt. I, as a teacher in music,have planned a curriculum in music for the  inmates of Tihar. This curriculum may be followed in other Prisons as well. Music has tremendous power..it brings peace and concentration to human minds almost immediately. Music therapy will definitely help overcome the devilish tendencies in humans...as i firmly believe that...each soul is potentially divine.. 
0 0 Hi, When we discuss public data, i believe we should have real time status of all infrastructure projects be available for public view as well. For example, a road is being expanded to 6 lane from 4 lanes, then its a matter of in-convenience to the public who are using the road during construction phase. So it will help a lot, if all the users are informed through any billboard, the current status of the project and how long it will take this project to be completed. 
0 0 confidential data should not be shared. as it is if any citizen wants any data from govt, he has the means of RTI.. so i don't feel another need for data sharing 
0 0 I appreciable step taken by the government of India by open data use license. Data and statics generated from data, plays a crucial role in the development and innovation of the new products and services and especially beneficial for the budding entrepreneurs . It should be accessible by one and all within the Indian territory. 
0 0 Hello , I want to give one suggestion specially for all professional who are working and shifting in different cities of India .for vehicles registration we should have some favour of not taking NOC and having registration again & again Appreciate positive response and support on this 
0 0 I feel little skeptical on this Open data initiative, As we all know Govt. data are also being searched widely by anti-national elements and will never be used for any good of the nation. Traces of data search, view & download are required. Key Organizations like Banks, Military & Nuclear establishments, all entry ports of the country, ministries like Home, Defense, Finance, MEA, Maps and location details their offices Also, Such initiatives can be traces and Intel for IB and State police teams 
0 0 Respected Sir, Please complete the Kalasa Banduri Project As Soon as Possible, this project will help thousands of farmers in the north Karnataka region during summer. Since I am belonging to the same region it's my sincere request as a citizen of india, so that you have a talks with both the state governments and resolve this issue. Thanks & Regards, Vinaykumar 
0 0 I suggest that any data that is not having any security restrictions can be shared in the public domain so that the same could be shared and accessed by the public. Over the period there is a necessity of converting and uploading spatial and non-spatial data for visualization and accessed by all for planning and implementation of a project. This definitely will minimize the official time consuming process in getting the clearance from the concerned authorities for Establishing a business. 
0 0 #OpenDataLicenceIndia: To prevent corruption, each public investment done must have phone number, address, email of the contractor and government officer who got that executed. This should be open to all. 
0 0 1. All National Highway should be made in at least 6 lane with cement road. 2. All river should be connected to each other for better utilization of water. if Gov. plans above activates then that will be great boost for Economy 
0 0 Opendata word itself very open to everyone. While everyone trying to learn digital technology some of them were most advance in that.  In that case to access the Opendata details should be some sort of gov ID. Like verified Email ids and mobile. Or in other case, if person or gov depts wants any Opendata details then, they must use one time password through mobile networks also their history should be save on server to avoid Internet antisocial attack. So security should be there. 
0 0 It is good initiative by Government but as a layman I would suggest a data which will be published should have relevance to their day to day life.by sharing all data which neither useful or to be understood will create a confusion only.I appreciate the efforts of the team digital India. I would further like to work if my services can help to reach to end users. 
0 0 It is a wonderful idea and is surely going to help innovators work on it and use it for the best of the society.We at Patiala Foundation are also working on collection of the same and bridging the gap between the community and the Essential service provider.www.patialafoundation.org and Mobile app "iSEWA" 
0 0 The idea is fantastic and urgently required to be implemented. I, as a researcher, finds it very difficult to get relevant data on social and economic aspects of our nation. Such data are often used in my research studies on social sciences. If implemented, this idea, would help all researchers with access to relevant data as quick as possible. However the government should take care of the data quality and reliability. The data with the government, I find, are often not accurate. 
0 0 Sir Anti Indian activities within India is in increasing stage.Strict & stern action should be taken against them whoever may be without any mercy. Implementation of Uniform civil code is necessary.People of India should be categorized on Income slab basis instead of cast as at present so that all financially weaker sections of call caste will get benefits. Cast system should be abolished. 
0 0 The initiative has good Idea, but certain data shall not shared, because it may lead disputes by creating forged, manufactured, fabricated, false, bogus documents. Besides this, as a pillar of digital India Initiative, the training of data entry, typing, digital courses may be better, if provided. 
0 0 Make use of a cloud platform to showcase the data such as on a Google drive. This way any and all users of the data can be tracked and illicit sharing of the data can be avoided to an extent. Also a system should be in place for real time data updates so people suing it are always up to date. The initiative is great since data analytics are very powerful in identifying trends, weaknesses and avenues of expansion. 
0 0 All documents can be digital and kept in a single user single resourse but whenever required to submit any data it can be share-able. Provided that the secrecy has to be ensured. It is useless to experience first their misuse, losing money etc. and then suffer further in police or legal procedures...as is in present scenerio. Better strenthen law and justice first, well in time,  then implement these advanced technological benefits !!! 
0 0 need to know when locations of anti social people are know what is done to ensure efficient protection of social resources? 
0 0 casteism if remains the propriertship of politics and parties there in it would be good. we dont want casteism in education and work. Knowledge is right of all and every one 
1 0 need to know about who is working on the Gov projects, why they got the project and time to time assessment of their work. Define KRA and KPI for all Government Contractors and Employees. Measure their efficiency and then determine whether they are eligible for the Gov. work or not. If not replace them. 
0 0 Open data use is a great initiative as far as the usefulness is expected but the same has to he critically viewed also for misuse....we have been experiencing debit/credit card/INB hacking due to ignorance of the users to keep secrecy. Already so many passwords are to be kept for everything that except the youth and well literate urbans  it is becoming a curse rather then bliss...  everywhere PAN Aadhaar Mobile bill Address roof Age proof etc etc dicuments reqd...should hv a single resoursed 
0 0 1. all national banks pension should be same. 2. there should be a place to log complain about public vehicals which emmit lot of smoke. It should not be limited to filing complain but tracking as well. 3. if there are poors, laborers waiting for work then there are many damaged roads that needs repair, parks, public places that needs cleaning every time. Cant they be employeed there. 
0 0 Advance in technology is good but we have to prevent worst side from this. In our country we have sufficient export personnel so we have to use their talent to stop/check from the worst side of so called modern technology. 
0 0 Govt must look at using business intelligence for open data which can not only make the system more transparent but also aid in decision making process. Thats the mantra how western and European countries have progressed in the past. 
0 0 I appreciate the governments stand on introducing vocational courses namely B.Voc (Bachelor in Vocation) in different streams. I was told that the HRD wants to start Masters program in vocation (M.Voc) which i feel is illogical and goes against the very ideology of a vocational course. The object of the vocational courses, if I'm right, is to enable early and easy livelihood based on skill based learning, therefore starting masters in vocation is nonsensical. 
0 0 It would be a wonderful initiative if it can be made public as the Government is to Govern and be answerable to what ever the public asks. I strongly believe it would be meaningful democracy if it acts in the lines of "Samaj aage satta peeche" 
0 0 Govt. must open the data except the defense related and Scientist.

0 0 I would like to give your benign attention, the Digital India Project may give preference to reduce the School Students baggage weight. Abolishing physical books and go for digital books. 
0 0 As per my views, there has to be open data usage which includes all websites to all citizens of India. Tariff plans should be minimized so as to allow citizens to use internet where ever possible. The internet speed in India is a major problem which needs to be tackled first. The speed of internet in India is bad compared to other countries. A sincere request to look into this matter and come up with a better solution. 
0 0 CCE pattern should be stopped immediately , it is harming the entire education system. Remove this rule of not failing a child till 8. 
0 0 1. I think the first & foremost requirement is to induct strict discipline in the management of both the house of Parliament. The way the members behave & conduct in the house is worse than a primary school class room. Viewing the conduct of the session, is a horrifying experience. 2. The Govt officers in all offices/ deptt be made more accountable & responsible. Any thing going wrong, the head of office be hold responsible, irrespective of any staff doing wrongly & unfairly. 
0 0 Information should be brought to public but to access that info.certain barrier like an account should be there which could only be opened via valuable Indian credentials like aadhar card no.,voter id no. etc. bcoz alot of foreign entities are there to misuse the data. 
0 0 Yes, we should be able to access the data. Transparency is very needed now to stop corruption. Meanwhile the finance details should not become a treat where people use it to blackmail departments or other countries will know the details of Indian confidential data, 
0 0 I want to say that there is urgent need to control population in India. We have several hundreds rule and regulation but unfortunately we dont have single rule to control population. Plz take hard decision to control population immediately otherwise there will be lots of problem. 
0 0 When it comes for transparency, govt should identify most corrupt department like revenue & stamp, RTO, municipal etc. As part of Digital India initiative, govt should make all these department accessible online. Registry request should be register online, RTO driving license process should be online. One India Oe road tax is pending for many years. Govt knows which department is most corrupted, they just need to control them gradually. 
1 0 The government has to ban the cinema, TV serial and most of the programmes are showing and damaging our Indian culture. And particularly TV Program are showing obscene dance program, unwanted family disputes, dispute between husband and wife having husband, two or more women connections, murder, rape and corruption etc.  This will affect the growing children as well as matured men and women mentality. Hope that you will take necessity steps ASAP. 
0 0 Data driven decision making is the order of the day. Large no of data available with government can be explosive when right people curate it to further the economic cause or organizational goals. Gallup.com and other portals give immense data collected by the government. Data can be sliced as per states or territories or even cities and local regions and provided to various stakeholders who are able to then make informed decisions to grow their own entity 
0 0 it is decision to established new kind administration. transparency is not a easy to established in various departments. first you should permit work through the constitution not a political parties leaders direction afterwards differently our system will change other wise as it is same now 
0 0 It has been observed that majority of the cinema, TV serial and other program are showing the culture opposite to the Indian culture. Moreover the majority of the TV program are showing murder,rap, corruption all the day and night . It will affect the child's and commom people's mantality . In indian culture it is touhgt that good things should be seen,discussed and heard. So I request to ensure the existance of Indian Cultural Values in chinemas and programs of all TV channels.

Sir, to save my crop I humbly request your goodself to provide the details of Banks who are providing the crop insurance and do the needful. Thanks ... 
0 0 I have a farm at Hingna, Dist-Nagpur, Maharashtra & I am farming on the same since two decades. I came to know from the various resources like TV, Mann ki Baat, News papers etc. that a crop insurance scheme has been announced under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna. As per the guidelines, I have approached various nearby Nationalized Banks as well as other Banks and found that till date there is no such GR towards crop insurance has been received by the Banks. 
0 0 Hi, believe the current VDS schemes suffers from serious defect that it gives an impression of loss / shaving off of 50% of the money upfront (in terms of tax & penalty). Another way to get this unaccounted money on record is by launching scheme similar to gold monetization scheme. i.e.  all VDS money will be locked in for a period of 20 yrs and no tax & penalty charged and will get cumulative interest after 20 yrs (500 basis point less than effective bond yield).

1 0 #OpenDataLicence, Open data access is very essential in many business, research, production etc. But the accessibility of data should be made level wise, means only limited data access should be allowed one time, also software should be made to check the usage of data. Authentication must be done online for validity of user along with security checks to avoid hacking and misuse. 
0 1 #MyGov Govt needs to control FaceBook, Twitter to operate in India, Govt can first ask these social media to record Nationalities, religions, and to include oath that FB or twitter accounts wont be used against spreading Hate,terror mentoring, Anti-human butchering propaganda like Zakir naik, if so they will be prosecuted.Also many women,ladies are cheated by unscrupoulous elements by FB,(in Hyderabad 5000 women were cheated by one person), So Govt should control these by periodic checks 
2 0 Shriman Modiji, Pictures speak thousand words. Please see attached my 2 suggestions. 
1 1 There should be a committee to keep check that no data related to national security and other top confidential matters like defence, census data based on religion , International affairs etc are made open. There is also a biggest threat of HACKERS these days on Online data and important documents. So this should also be kept in mind. And strong law for punishment for offending and misusing of this available data for individual as well as companies. Thank you. 
0 0 Its grreat. All data of Govt. required for setting a bussiness, research, production, resouces availablity etc. if available to public, the nation will benefit. Only the data availabilty of which creates some issue like law and order national security etc. need not be published. 
1 0 I think the policy must specify what format the data would be provided in. It must me machine readable and analyzable - json, csv, XML, mysql dumps etc. Providing excel data as a screenshot or scanning a printout as a bitmap - is providing data, but is unusable. 
0 0 (6) collection of fares by national railways should be as per metro delhi (7) railways and airlines should adopt no  refund  policy only  extentional dates  may  be given  maximum 3 times (8)tokens issued at  metro delhi  should  be  taken as  journey start , no  need of  token  re - registration  at  in  gates  .(9)property sale  should  be  through  auction only to  bring  total  check  on  black  money  invoved  in  property deals

0 0 tion measures can be adopted in each sector like devlopment of particular region,industrialization,public health etc. The critical review of data from different institutions and organisation on a particular element/s can lead to more authenticate the results. 
0 0 Personnel Tax should be abolished as I hope government spends more on collection then it gets,for small businessman there can be % Tax  on the turnover & for big houses it should be turnover tax + compulasry tax of 5 to 7%. I am hopefull the so called blackmoney sshall change its colour to white in a very short duration. 
1 0 Cut data cost to one fourth and then see the participation of the public. Ban all religious based political wings. 
0 0 Indians do not want pay taxes unnecessarily. He plans to avoid his accounting. Net result is taxes rule generates defaulters and thus black money is created in India.  We can simply abolish all taxes and custom duties to a simple TounOverTax with compulsary TDS say 001 to maximum 5% according to the nature of the trade. Those who do cash only may be asked to get prepaid tax coupon to regularise his accounts. No need to have tax returns. Indians do not mind cumpalsary TDS. 
0 0 open data may be incarnated with open technology license for the ongoing technological developments which may lead to open competitive market for the skill and talent development and further the price will be decreased in the open source market. e.g electric vehicle technology, renewable source of energy development and fuel making etc. 
0 0 Lots of profitable idea goes in vain due to lack of skill and money. If they will meet Good investors they can truly be a successful Indian and they will definitely be resourceful to India.A website or app must be prepared where ideas,skill and investors meet with common purpose 'development'. I have an Idea which i think is great in many aspect but i don't know how to take it in affect.

0 1 #clause3a is negated by #clause4d for legal use. There could be a process for an applicant to ask for data for legal purposes which could be presented in a format that cannot be manipulated. 
1 0 This is a great bill and I would like to see it go through. I am however concerned about the implementation. Currently when I search for government data, I find excel results in PDF format.

0 0 Hon'ble PM Sir, My suggestion towards encouraging SWACHH BHARAT Mission is that all the Public Waste Dump places must be under CCTV Surveillance so that a Centralized way of Monitoring these WASTAGE-DUMP AREAS can be ensured. Also it will yield into a BETTER WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM along with SECURITY MEASURE as at many instances we have witnessed through Media that from many a Garbage Dump Yards,ABANDONED INFANTS/INJURED PERSONS have been recovered. This will check the CRIME GRAPH too.Regards. 
0 0 Sir, This initiative will fail if the government offices it self are not digitalized. It even misses basic digital system like HR System that reduces huge wastage of time and resources. Kindly look into it, else the slow pace of Governance will not be fast-tracked.

0 1 Bollywood has a great impact on people. Public gets quite inspired by what the actors Do, think n say. If the actors and actresses show how cool it is to do the right things in their movies, People will surely get moved. It quite worked for go Green,Save water n electricity, etc. They may now target clean city, safety of women (killing the rapist in every person)etc. This in my view should be done a bit secretly. As, when People get to know that they are being taught they would ignore the lesson 
1 1 How to Improve - Remember me! -Database is easy to create (even I can create it within 72 Hours of PHP script coding) -People must recognize the use of internet - at least a free allowance to xwebsite.com -A sim-card supplied by the government.

4 1 मेने कुछ दिन पहले एक ऐसा दृश्य देखा जिसने मुझे बहुत दुःख दिया। मेने 90 साल के बुजुर्ग आदमी और 85 साल की बुजुर्ग औरत को पैदल अपने घर से 1 km दूर बैंक जाते देखा। वो बैंक में सिर्फ 200 रूपये वृद्धा पेंशन लेने जाते हे हर महीने। उनके पास मोटर साइकल नहीं हे तो पैदल जाते हे बिच में तीन जगह बैठकर ।मोदी जी आप बोलते हो की हमने 1000 रूपये पेंशन कर दिये तो मध्यप्रदेश के जावद गॉव में 200 रूपये क्यों दिए जा रहे हे और दूसरी   यह की क्या उन वृद्ध लोगो को पेंशंन बैंक का कर्मचारी घर आकर नहीं दे सकता हे क्या? 
2 0 On every death and there should be attached a photo of the body or baby in the govt portal along with finger prints and in terms of baby along with their parents aadhaar no . So that we can avoid all human traffic and missing of babies incidents too. All the religious and other crematorium and hospitals burials should be linked to the govt portal so the automatic updating could be possible.And death records should be shared to election,pds,aadhar, departments immediatly. 
0 1 Jai Vigyan. Do we have controls in place while giving away so much information? THe govt has given so much to social media (private and public owed companies). However in cases of extremist views being imposed on the society by a small section, they are looking for means to control. We need a judiciously built-in policy to control information to institutions of indian and foreign and conglomerate origins with indian and foreign wings. 
0 1 There should be law to create a e-mail id and other social media account opening. And should be created only after with self live camera photo of the creator and on every attachment when they are posting there should be photo of them should be attached so we can reduce the cyber crime in vast. On every fund transfer there should be same as above would curb the illegal fund transfer. 
0 1 All the 10th standard students should be informed to create their e-mail id and upload  the e-mail data to exam board . And the answer sheets of the students and their mark sheets should be given to them to their e-mail it. This should be implemented in staff selection exams too. The answers also given to them along with the mark sheet. It could avoid the lethargic attitude of the teachers who correcting the exams too. In school level at least mark sheets should given to them in the e form. 
0 1 The nominees of any financial products should uploaded with the aadhaar linked bank account details. Otherwise there is chance of corruption. While taking an application itself it must required to collect the photo identity and bank account details of the nominee should be mandatory. Ex: insurance policy, (Life , vehicle , general) bank accounts, shares, mutual funds, postal and fixed deposits and so on. It should be asked to collect for the existing account holders too. inform immediately.

1 2 Respected ,Sir,Pranam Its true that youth power can play important role to national development.Actually sir I want to say on side of education my idea is that an educational app should be made for standard 1 to 12 in which all sectors of boards are included under each boards their respected subjects are present in which its particular chapter is explained in video matter by good proffessor.

0 2 Certificates of Grade 10, 12, Bachelor Degree etc all should also mention the Aadhar Card number and every recognized institute issuing the Certificate should submit the certificate in electronic format to the National Certificate Depository. This will remove the "fake certificate" and unscrupulous players from the market. 
0 2 For example; we should have ready access of the skill set of teachers across the country; in fact all teachers should regularly update their profile; skill set, qualifications etc, so that "research organizations, companies, NGO' can then follow up and approach for focused skill development, we should have a nationwide visual of what is the skill progress of our teachers, are they keeping pace with times. 
0 0 On the top of all this too much of data can be over helming, so analytic tools should be deployed to deliver information to public. In the US, Department of Homeland Security leverages some advanced algorithms - for example companies like; Palantir to analyze the tera-bytes of data. It is high time all data of Govt. of India is churned thru' and transformed into VALUABLE "INFORMATION" and made available for research and development. 
0 0 The govt has tons of valuable data; demographics, income profiles, no. of houses, NGO's in action, Ration Cards in a city, Driving Licenses, No. of Cars in the city, type of cars, brands, etc, electricity monthly bill details, Income tax details -- for example; Mumbai has 2 crore people, 10 lac own apartments, 5 lac cars, no. of school children, 1.8 crore aadhar card holders, 20 lac passport holders, no. of tourist arivals etc etc...!! All these are valuable inputs for startups.

Every time when their passport got scanned it should ask for recently generated unique permission file no to go. 
1 1 Govt should give permission licence & encourage setting up of private labs,who can inspect any food,dress,or any home appliances & can give details if they are not matching with standards or criteria mentioned by sellers.They can inspect houses to be bought by public to assure standards are followed.They can give certificate on quality of road,bridges & public works.So people can raise questions on the govt works.They can charge people who need their service,this allow to raise standard of life.

1 1 I want to express my idea about the concept of E-Voting.I should have voted 2/3 times for MP/MLA elections but upto now only one time, as I am always from my home during elections. So the concept of e-voting is best to increase the percentage of voters. So just give instructions to companies having manpower more than 20/50 to provide data base of all employees (voter card no, Aadharcard, Passport, DL) and then make an app for it. Vote can be voted by phone/internet from anywhere & no cheating.

0 0 लोकतंत्र में भी बिना चुनावी जीत के सत्ता तक पहुंचकर केवल उद्योगपतियों के लाभ के लिए नीतियाँ बनाने वाले लोग यह भूल गए हैं कि जो जनता सत्ता में लाती है वही वक़्त आने पर किनारे भी लगा देती है। मोदी जी से यही अपेक्षा है कि वो अपनी पूर्ववर्ती सरकार द्वारा की गयी गलतियों से सबक ले और वित्त मंत्रालय द्वारा गरीबों और मजदुरों के भविष्य से खिलवाड़ बंद कराएं। 
0 0 1000-2000 रूपये की मासिक बृद्धि से हिंदुस्तान का विकाश बाधित होने लगता है किन्तु जब वही सरकार बैंकों के करोड़ों लूटकर बैठे उद्योगपतियों को ब्यापार में सहूलियत देती है और उनको कानूनों से बचाकर विदेश भेज देती है तो कोई हलचल नहीं होती है। बात साफ है, केंद्र की सत्ता में अपनी चापलूसी के बल पर स्थापित गरीब और मजदूर बिरोधी तत्वों द्वारा इस प्रकार के अन्यायपूर्ण निर्णय लिए जा रहे हैं। 
0 0 । सातवें वेतन आयोग की सिफारिसों पर सरकार का निर्णय केवल अन्याय और अविवेकपूर्ण ही नहीं है बल्कि पूर्णतया गलत तथ्यों पर आधारित है। न्यूनतम वेतन 7000 की जगह 18000 कर देने की बात भी सफेद झूठ है क्योंकि 125% डीए और भत्तों के साथ यह पहले ही 18000 की सीमा तक पहुँचा हुआ है। जबकि मूल वेतन बढ़ जाने के बाद कटौतियों में बृद्धि हो जाने से वास्तविक बढ़ोत्तरी नगण्य ही है। यहाँ यह भी ध्यान रखना होगा कि केंद्र के बिभागों में 92% कर्मचारी तृतीय और चतुर्थ श्रेणी के हैं जिनका वेतन का औसत 25000 है। 
0 0 वर्ष 1999-2004 में वाजपेयी जी के नेतृत्व वाली एनडीए की सरकार ने केंद्र सरकार के लाखों कर्मचारियों को सरकार द्वारा गारंटीड पेंशन बंद कर दिया था और उनके भविष्य को बाजार के हवाले कर दिया था। सरकार को सेंसेक्स की बढ़ती दर के साथ साथ ऊद्योगपतियों और अफसरों द्वारा दिखाये गए स्वप्न पर भरोसा था। लेकिन 2004 लोकसभा के परिणामों ने सारा फीलगुड ख़राब करके भाजपा को ऐसा झटका दिया जिससे होश में आने में उसे 10 वर्ष लग गए। किन्तु एक बार फिर पूर्ण बहुमत के दंभ और घमण्ड ने केंद्र सरकार को निर्मम बना दिया है।

0 0 Revised new law is required to minimize corruption and crime. Because though  C.B.I., vigilance and other anti corruption department who traps the corrupted officer and leader etc, they are suspended. But After some days most of  them are reappointed with promotion without seizing their property and few of them punished for short period. In other way many criminals  are also released due to late justice and sufficient proof. They insist further crime. Hence the strict law may be made according

0 0 Dear PM sir A lot of energy is consumed in street lighting by local bodies. It is often seen that street lights are not switched off timely in the morning and often switched on too early in the evening due to lethargy of the staff concerned. Sir, is it possible to sensitise them on seasonal basis and introduce resettable automatic switch on/off switch...? Also a higher level officer to monitor?Because even saving by 15 min for a big area /city can make a big difference... thank u , sir
