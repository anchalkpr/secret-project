1 0 Dear Prime Minister, Since u r coming to inaugurate Chandigarh international airport on 11th, I want to appeal you one most important thing.  I am employee there and like to appeal you that while inaugurating the airport please praise and acknowledge the hard work of labour class and basic workers.  They have made this airport by their hard work in hot and cold but they never enjoy the luxurious services over there. And very less employees who are white collars did their duties well to make this airport.  Others are just filling their pockets by such huge project.  I think u sud not come bcos ur government is for poors... or u sud ask airlines to make fares in limit of poors n lower class.
1 0 can anyone tell me which is da best medium/department/entity or way to complaint for a Central government officer who is corrupt and misbehaved.  i have to complaint for a employee of Airport Authority of India

0 0 They can guide the person whoever comes to choose according to their skill, education and interest.
1 0 There should be a centre where they can guide about all the available jobs in India or self business. Career cluster book can be created. Like, Education department means not only teachers , professor, there also Principal , Other school / college staffs works is there. Similaly in hospital , not only Doctors, other staffs are there starting from cleaner to Manager. So all the department career cluster book can be reference for the counselor who sits in the centre.

0 0 An Idea to use Cloud Storage to select and pursue a Career The internet enabled enhanced communication. But the vast amount of storage on Cloud has provided a tremendous opportunity for information to be communicated to anyone with a basic internet connection at all times and in all places. This feature can be used to address a couple of social issues that need addressing if India is to really utilise its “demographic dividend”. More details attached
0 0 Objective:  “To Help Youth to Realize their Aspirations” Youth have aspirations but there are no credible institutions to help them talk or discuss their issues. Youth also need assistance to understand their real needs and strengths and build their life around these. There are many “Market players” who drive youth to achieve their company goals rather than what an Youth want. Yuva Poshak would become the answer for this issue ... more details in the concept note
0 0 Step 1 - Create Zones (East,West,North,South) then subdivide zones in to minimum 10 centres Step 2 - Use poll data, demographic data and census data from above zones and identify the level of education and awareness, skills and ability along with what training or support required, local recognised NGOs, schools/colleges can be involved in this Step 3 - be flexible with centres, close and open it wherever needed and involve media for constant support and gaining mass ideas
0 0 The Career Centre Should be named "Local Employment Assistance Program (LEAP). LEAP will help taking a another leap into the student career. the tag line should be "Leap ka Samadhan , Ab naukri pana hoga aasan". Attached is the detailed suggestion. Thanks
0 0 My suggestions for career center initiative.
1 0 The career centre needs to work in tandem with the industry and not merely be another institution. The career centre needs to discuss with the local industrial houses on their requirements and run courses accordingly, If skilled manpower is available locally as per the need and requirement of local industry then it creates a win win situation for all. There will be social upliftment of geographical area, no migration, job opportunities for youth of the local area.
0 0 Sir, The suggestion may be initiated at the village/district level. If effective, it may be extended to the national level.
0 0 The challenge is that the career centres should be able to come to the rescue of those in the informal sector like electricians, carpenters, etc. They don't have access to proper mechanisms which can help them in commanding good salaries or fees. I have attached a pdf file which endeavors to provide some solutions to this challenge based on market dynamics.
0 0 a. Branding of Career Centres:    Name : Pathway for youth tagline : Blooming choice with voice
0 0 A self review of past hundred days may kindly be published to enthuse nation, preferably category wise.
0 0 #Career Centre , how the private training sector works , business model. Training is high growth area, revenue from training fees and commission from recruiters. Here govt will pay training fees in low skill and high attrition area, High skill demand area recruiters can pay training fees ( at least part) .this corpus can be used for sustained training.
0 0 Attached PDF file has the details
0 0 # career centre -standard evaluation and certification.job portal to match and map skill gaps.private player can take paid candidate .there is mixed groups for better cross learning. Link to Aadhar ,messaging services to inform about training and placement.
0 0 # career centre  flexibility of programmes is the key .full time,evening Progm,weekend Progm to address need of underemployed youth. Programme should be modular like basic skills, soft skills and different levels of skills , technical and non technical. Classroom and lab / computer lab. Counselling centre for career guidance . Sustainability- private partner should get long term contract 3-5 years. Private partner will develop infrastructure .trained and certified faculty,standard content.
0 0 Skill development Trg is urgent need to channelise youth energy and reap demographic dividend. My suggestion are for skill Dev Trg for unemployed and underemployed youth. The career centre has to be universal in terms of its branding, look and feel and content. # Career centre may be names as "YES  centre "  ( Youth empowerment and skill centre). It's young,trendy. It should be in schools and polytechnics, which is socially neutral places. Career centre can be operated from two class rooms.
0 0 #CareerCentre   Dear Sir, please find the enclosed file. I suggested some points to start career centres for our government school and colleges. I hope some of its part at least would work to make our dream come true.

0 0 WITH THE HELP OF RESTRUCTURING OF POST OFFICE OR DAK VIBHAG IN EACH STATE WE CAN CREATE JOB AS WELL AS BUSSINESS FOR YOUTH BY PROVIDING AGENCY OR FRANCHISEE TO PEOPLE.BECAUSE WHEN PRIVATE CURRIER COMPANY EARN THEN WHY GOVT. SECTOR NOT EARN WHEREEVER IN EACH SMALL/RURAL AREA GOVT. ESTABLIMENT (POST OFFICE) IS AVAILABLE. BUT THIS FACILITY NOT AVAILABLE WITH PRIVATE. ALSO WITH THIS WE CAN START MORE SERVICES LIKE DIGITAL INDIA AT EACH VILLAGE. LIKE KIYOSK WITH SAME ESTABLISHMENT.
0 0 Career points should be set up every district level of state or territory  for enhancing carrier building of the youth boys & girls . Students are getting bookish knowledge after that creating Unemployment problem. Some of the states presently not getting proper advise thus carrier points can guide them correctly.  Carrier points should be form  by  locally not by ruling govt.
0 0 The government should incentivise private colleges and schools to allow usage of their premises to discharge career centric training in the evenings. This will not only signicantly reduce the cost of setting up and scaling initiatives in this sector but also raise accountability of educational institutions towards the society. Further this will also enable young educated Indians to get alligned with such initiatives on a volunteer basis.
0 0 The career centers, should focus on having people who come from the industry and part their experiences, only then the participants are benefited with real world experience rather than the usual bookish stuff which is quite common. Make it a rule that every professional spends 30 mandatory hours per year at career centers, a carrot and stick policy does work well. Link this time spent towards career development to their own skills upgradation.
0 0 All High schools/Junior colleges with 11th and 12th education and degree colleges (both government and private) should have a career center. Job providers shall provide the list of various job profiles in their organization. This should be categorized based on job function and skill required. All senior students should be provided with analytic data on skills required for jobs they wish to do and suggest relevant courses. Job providers need not bother about background verification.
0 0 career centers focus should be more on small towns and grooming should be at age of 14 so that teenagers should know from the beginning which path to be take. hume 20-22 saal umar tak pata nahi hota ki kya karein
1 0 Proposed Career Centres should be started at District Level. Functions of the centre will be 1) to find available career opportunities (Education, Medicines, Business, Industries etc.) 2) to recognise skills which are required for joining these careers 3) link up with existing employment exchange centre to get list of eligible candidates 4) to provide them with required communication and trade skill 5) to place them in various organisations. Unemployed youths should be allowed to run the centre.
0 0 Respected sir, you are a symbol of resurgent vibrent and strong india who has given due importance to hands on knowledge. aviation security world over is a specialised subject but in our country senior officials in Bureau of civil aviation security come on deputation most of them without any domain knowledge qualification and specific past experience .Bureau of civil aviation security cadre officials have no chance of any future promotional avenue in higher posts. requested in public interest
0 0 Really interesting and Innovative idea. This work can be considered!!!!
1 0 s all know there are reservation categories at every steps of Indian life, even the noble profession HEALTH SCIENCE, MAHARASHTRA has 53% category reservation, above MARATWADA, VIDARBHA reservation. Then (my knowledge) why there is no such reservation in LOK SABHA, RAJYA SABHA & STATES VIDHAN SABHA why??? why???? why???????. Respected, P.M. Mr Narendra Damodar Modi Sir Pl. can you give reasons.
1 0 Entrance to these institutes should be made subject to certain qualification and more so conferment of WSQ certificates/diplomas, etc., should be made subject to rigorous test/examination and exams/test should be conducted by third . Big corporate houses (like Ambani’s, Tatas, Godrej, etc.) can be asked to operate NCC /NCCE/NCI as part of their CSR programmes, where the people from low income group can be  subsidized.
0 0 The Centres should be operated only by pioneer institutions in the area. From the very beginning of the scheme the criteria should be all NCC /NCCE/NCI should be very stringent. To be eligible for  NCC status, the Centre must demonstrate the ability to achieve outcomes, ensure organisation excellence and provide quality Workforce Skill Qualification (WSQ) programmes and services.
0 0 	Enterprise Training Support (ETS) - One can benefit from better training opportunities, structured career progression and enjoy fair wages tied to industry standards under this scheme. 	Workfare Training Support (WTS) Scheme - Funding support to help workers improve their skills through training. For eligible workers, Workfare Training Support (WTS) Scheme should get attractive funding support for skills training
0 0 	Productivity Initiatives in Services & Manufacturing (PRISM)  - Managers and supervisors can become effective productivity champions by picking up tools to help their companies improve productivity and their staff to become a more productive workforce through courses and training offered under PRISM.
0 0 Following schemes can be made part of Skill Development Programmes: 	Skills Training for Excellence Programme (STEP) -  Whether you are an entry-level or mid-level manager, or senior-level executive, STEP can help you remain competitive and employable in today's fast-changing market. One can develop his/her skills and gain key insights into the latest industry trends via subsidised programmes under STEP. 

0 0 Tag Line Suggestions – 1.  “Learning for Quality Life” -	2. “Learning for Life Advancement”
0 0 The brand of the institution is more valuable when the quality is supreme and that there should be no compromise on the output promised to the expectation of the people. The name of the agency implementing the mission can be “Career Development Agency/CDA  or National Workforce Skill Development Agency”. Institutes/Training Centres can be named on lines  of “National Career Centres”, “National Centre of Continuing Education/NCCE, National Career Institutes (NCIs), etc.”
1 0 Branding of Career Centres: A name and tagline communicating the objectives with particular focus on provision of employment and counselling related services to the youth of the country. Suggestion – The name of the institute should reflect the vision, dedication and branding of national and global importance of the institute. One very important thing about building a  brand is “Exclusiveness within reach” and “Quality”. Privileged things are more valuable
0 0 there is need for virutual skill development centre for certain skills. 1. advanced software skills 2. sales 3.employable /servicing of appliances need for removal of entry qualifications. anyone who is enthusiatic need to be allowed to get trained.
0 0 there are many areas where we as Indian can focus and if Gov work on right direction, lots of job can be created. we have young power and whole world is looking towards us with hope. 1. Teacher where i think Gov is already working 2. Indian Foods are very famous in world, Gov should take some initiative to increase job in this field. we should develop an institute where all Indian can be trained in cooking.
0 0 It should have a seperate panel which act as a temporary job provider for small job seekers like plumber,electrician those who have skill but not customers.They should register their name and number in that panel and tell that in what they are expert then any customer need any service will call in panel and they can provide them mobile number of registered person.
1 0 BRAND NAME OF CAREER CENTRE- UDYAMI BHARAT TAGLINE- AB HAR PRATIBHA KO MILEGA ROZGAR
0 0 At last one has to do a job or run a business with required education along with necessary certifications.If the government is really serious to build a career centre then it should start from 10th standard with compulsory internship in the industries. Unemployment is not due to shortage of skills but due to lack of jobs in the organized sectors. Unorganized sectors should be transform into organized sectors.All school teachers or college professors should provide & help in career planning.
0 0 lets market our history to this modern world ! It will give employment !
0 0 Lets Build Brilliants Bharath. Vijayalakshmi
0 0 There is a trade of ayurveda therapist which requires a good number of man power at the growing national and international demand. the tragedy is that there is no state and guidance by the bodies for private sectors to take up the skill education and provide empowerment to few of the millions.
0 0 The name can be "Bharat Next".The tagline can be "Let's build India together." The inherent talent and strength of each individual to be assessed and given skill-based training. Employers to contribute a % of profit to Bharat Next Career Fund.Job seekers also can contribute a part of salary for upgrading their skills.The center should have a world-class skills training infrastructure. Changes in law to be made to procure a % of hardware/electronics etc from Indian manufacturers only.
0 0 #SkillDevelopment We are seeing a boom in Retail and more so in the e-commerce domain and there is lot of demand for skilled workforce to work at different levels in this area. Whereas the trainings are there for people managing operations, I don't see the courses for the ones who do work ie. course for Delivery boy, a warehouse worker, a packer, a loader. To me these are opportunities where we can establish Skill development centers in village to tap talent for the growing demand in cities
0 0 An administrative service to manage temples and other places of worship - covering planning, architecture, hygiene, crowd management, infra management can be instituted.  We have tens of thousands of large temples not properly managed.  Having this will provide better service at our temples and promote pilgrimage, tourism etc.
0 0 Landscape architecture and allied professions such as landscape maintenance and implementation look after the design and management of outdoor environment where man has a footprint.Restoration of degraded ecosystems in mining, infrastructure, river and lake ecosystems, urban design and community ecosystems employ these professionals worldwide. south Korea alone has 4000 graduates each year. India has around 60 postgraduates.It is worth 2 billion US dollars annually in the USA alone.
0 0 My ideas submitted in a PDF.
0 0 For ex: A sports teacher can be hired in a kids based NGO from another NGO focussed on sports, similarly a communication expert from that kids based NGO can be hired in a sports based NGO. This will not only give employment to people but will also give holistic view to the individuals
0 0 I think the only way to get the best out of any centre is by making it a sustainable entity. There should be a pilot test done for it.I suggest government to start with NGOs. There are NGOs in different categories. For ex: One NGO is focussed on imparting sports related training, while other is focussed on education. Every NGO needs manpower which is hired from outside. Rather than hiring from outside, NGOs should hire resources from each other based on the skill set
0 0 nder Services to be offered, Job matching should also include automatic alert services. This will help the job seeker to define his qualification and job requirements. The app should send alerts to his/her email on potential job opportunities that mathces his requirements automatically and periodically. This will keep the job seeker motivated and also exposes the opprotunities to all who are specifically looking for the same. Like (0) Dislike (0) reply स्पैम की रिपोर्ट करें Share

0 0 One most important thing is giving training for 1week or 2 weeks wont make them professional. No person from related field with hands on experience will come and give training. As per our curriculum, most important is classroom teaching not the field experience. Until the changes are made curriculum to have field / industry experience, it is not possible to achieve the full objective of this program.
0 0 Dear Sir ! Very good evening There is a lot of center for this like SSC, IBPS, UPSC etc. but the problem is- There is no collaboration of academic courses and professions. A student get his/her degree and then search the job. Make the academic courses with full of training/practical events so that we found skilled persons after academic. For the career center, make only one center (with different sectors) for all the career and posed total responsibility(including corruption in appointment).
0 0 Training & education facilty should be provide free of cost to all beggers & slum peoples, Govt should take step towards the education & employment opportunity for beggers & slum peoples. this activity reduces unemployment & will improve the standard of living of the people & it will help to develope the economy.
0 0 Name and tagline :Niyukti-Apki pehchaan ,Apki Shakti Career centers should also benefit the orphans in orphanages,street beggars,handicapped. Network of career counselors can also be formed at Industries/MNCs/ as experienced people can effectively counsel .This can be done in person, via mails,over telephone etc.
0 0 Career centres should be such that they inform the registered people what to do in order to get employment.For example for an electronics & communication student(engineer) they should provide training in Embedded system,VLSI,etc. by top experts from industry.   #CareerCentre, #MinistryofLabourandEmployment, #NationalCareerService, #NSC, #NationalCareerServiceProject, #MyGov

0 0 Each Talukas and Districts Village & City should have at least 1 Career Centre each. These Career Centre should provide details on all Jobs/Skill Development related information and how to go for it, including Farming/Government & Private and Independent Career Job details. These Career Centre should have dedicated Professional Career Guides. Job details and Job/Request status should be available online & tracking of job details should be done online.
0 0 The document is very clever with all those 6models....
0 0 really great work to help people in our nation
0 0 nice idea , for revenue based model to maintain the unemployment.....
0 0 Many youth are ready to fight against corruption, give them a job like special inspectors ( may be permenant or temporary) who should enter the govt offices like common people and identify the corruption happening in each departments, Like Hospitals, Police stations, taluk offices and other public services offices.
0 0 This idea will trigger lot of awareness in youths. Specially, In rural areas. I am from rural area. Youth in rural areas have caliber. But the main problem is career awareness and guidance. With the help of Career Centres, we can give guidance and roadmap to youth in rural areas. #CareerCentre,#NationalCareerServiceProject, #MyGov
0 0 This idea may bridge the gap between  prospective employers and  job seekers (whether they are a student or a seasoned expert). Maintaining digitalized and centralized human resource database through this integrated application will be reliable from employer perspective since it has Bio-metric verification. Thus it has been covering most of the essential element of good application for employment exchange system, it deserves to get selected.

0 0 I am ready to contribute as a teacher and learner in whichever capasity it will be usefull.Carrer centers must provide carrier direction also for participants which must be inline with national objective. It shuold be employment exchange.It should create skiled workforce which will find relavant opportunities in outside world.
0 0 Career centers must be focused on Skill development.Where even educated people can also come and sharpen their skills.These can be started in Schools and colleges once their cources are over in day time.Experts from diffrent trades/area of life should be invited to teach.Startups should encourage to take skiled people from such carrer centers.Carrer centers should also look to encourage local entrerperinual skills amoung its participants.
0 0 Career and recruitment should be two separate issue, Career planing should be inculcate in school level this may include school level programme to show roles in various career by people from all streams of society . How to achieve the career and skil and mindset to targeted career.

0 0 R/sir, here is my idea for developing career centres at villiage lev1. we should involve bachtgats in this initiative,because there is a strong need of career centers at villages and taluka level and then at big cities. 2. Bachtgats are the one who can perform this task effectively and in this way they will get an opportunity to work. 3. These centers should have respected professionals from society so that people will listen to them There should be award points  bachat gats.
0 0 modi ji, yadi aap skill Development Centre Opan karna Chahte hi h to Pahle apne eduaction system ko durust karna hoga.wha baccho ko teaching k sath practical knowledge mile aur continous monitoring ho k aj konsa experiment ya job perform hua.aap pahle jitne Vaccant seats h unhe fill kare aur wha skilled person bhi ho jo k baccho aur jawan sabko kewal skilled banaye. I salute you sir,par aap education system ko durust kare. Hamare jitne bhi IIT h wha k student at least one year apne desh ko de
0 0 Time has come to setup "Employment Exchange". Bring MNREGA and Employment under same roof. NASSCOM had initiative for IT professional's database, similarly there should be database for employments. It should work like a Stock Exchange for company's who are looking for recruitment.
0 0 Now a day it’s a trend of outsourcing as the cost in India is less than other countries, I would recommend that small government enterprises and other outsourcing govt and pvt  work should be assigned through career center like kisan call center, other survey works of government also should be given to each district wise and the people living there. So that everyone has a small income rather than outsourcing to other big companies for a bulk amount.Lets make a path for development.
1 0 Proposed career guidance centres should highlight on skill development of passouts irrespective of their branch/stream across the country. Let it replace employment exchange centres running sluggishly under various state governments. Based on skills learnt during the training period, let the person be employed, not mearly by his/her marks. Let it be named as "Swami Vivekananda Yuva Samvahini Centres".
0 0 Given the focus on "Make in India", we should set up centers which build skills in manufacturing. These need not be diplomas in engineering but have to ensure we equip our young people across the country to confidently manage different kinds of manufacturing jobs. The choice of the specific skill sets can be based on the indigenous manufacturing location (e.g. if there is iron ore nearby and we have a steel based unit, we can teach smelting).

2 0 Respected Sir/Madam, here are my thoughts on Career centres in few bullets: 1. Start from school/Colg level: Introduce career counselling at school/Colg to provide and guide students with information on career options for each stream~Science/commerce/arts. 2. Invite role models to school/Colg for lectures ~ Defence officers, Doctors, Engineers, Actors, Media etc. Students can relate to their role models and identify their interest areas early. 3. Introduce Vocational courses at school level
0 0 jab bina learning ke child & youth pass honge to skill progress kis parkar hogi or jab child & youth me learning attitude hi nahi hoga to career center se kya hoga.in Bharat most school send child in next class without passing marks.at first makes strong practical education system. Agar hum schools ko career center ke roop me develop krenge to skill development  & learning attitude bachpaan se hi hoga.skill development makes strong career so as career center schools are best option.
0 0 Sear sir/Madam, I am a psychologist by profession. I am meeting many students and youngsters for career guidance everyday. In my opinion, all Indians need psychological career guidance through career centers. India lacks scientific career guidance perspective as most of us look for only job opportunities and not for job suitableness. Scientifically, aptitude, motivation and personality should match with the course/career path chosen. If any of these do not match, there will be issues.
0 0 There are huge number of professionals in their late 40's and early 50's who are either free to quit job or self-employed and such people can be employed by the "Career Centres" for skill development of the youth. It will help in the youth getting direct practical approach of the work place that they desire to enter.

0 0 1. I have observed one thing in particular which I should like to bring to the notice of sensible people. The fruits of a rich man's labour are wealth. If these fruits are placed in the hands of the wise, they use them with great delight in far better ways than the rich.
1 0 let the private public partnership be used to set up career centers and skill development centers in smaller cities and towns. You govt can think of providing tax and non tax incentives to industry for their participation. This initiative can also be treated as part of CSR. Importantly these centers must be setup in smaller cities and towns. The smaller the city/town more the incentive. Also the centers must promote for skill development of widows and orphans.
0 0 1.Start from the roots - career guidance should be introduced in schools and colleges to help students get a better idea about their careers and future job prospects. 2. There has to be a centralised national database, which should log both, the jobs by Companies and CV's by job seekers 3. We keep on reading about various vacancies in government jobs. Have counselors at career centres to help guide prospective employees. 4. Regular circulation of job openings by mail/SMS.
0 0 Pl. invite accomplished professionals from different discipline for nation building. Offer them social projects and credit back with a honorary government officer post. I am sure there is huge leadership and innovative individuals who will be willing to join hands with government for a change. Salary to them does not matter as long as there is a way to recognize. I am very much one among those - with diverse industry experience with Aditya Birla Group, ISRO, Infosys, Cognizant etc..
1 0 a.	Branding of Career Centres: A name and tagline communicating the objectives with particular focus on provision of employment and counselling related services to the youth of the country NAME- प्रगति (Pragati) Means progress in English aptly explains the soul of the initiative. TAGLINE- “Aage Badhein, Tarraki karein" Please refer to pdf file for more detail.

0 0 there should be a future paling of children department in every higher or secondary higher schools, colleges which can suggests the students for future courses and job opportunities on he   basis of students interests.
0 0 Sir, we are doing great in all front. Just because few have-nots blaiming the Govt. Pls implement all the laws made till now on action. We won't required any new law.
0 0 Counting experience in number of years instead of actual and effective outputs and outcomes achieved is still the basic (flawed) criterion for all government jobs. #CareerCentre, #MinistryofLabourandEmployment, #NationalCareerService, #NSC, #NationalCareerServiceProject, #MyGov
0 0 in India the education quality is very poor. So first we need to improve the quality of our teachers , education technology, practical knowledge and feature planning of students.
0 1 I challenge you Mr Modi even if I return after 20 years to India from abroad, I'll be finding the same traffic nuisance, garbage everywhere, lack of women respect, corruption, violation of traffic, pathetic roads, drainages, no adequate social security for poors, dust, pollution, animals on street & filthy state of things in India. Visit Hero Honda Chowk, Gurgaon once & you will see what I have stated above. I feel disgusted to be an Indian. You only know how to give lectures that's it.
0 0 It will be good for one single site in which adding CV which can help every one to get the job. Also in this site there should be training information as well which can tell people to understand the market trend. So accordingly people can plan to attend the training.
0 1 I feel that half my search of a quality life is killed, the moment I am born in India. I feel disgusted to see you not fulfilling any promise you made to the people of India. Your Govt. launches useless schemes like " Swacch Bharat Abhiyan" where after months of launching, one cannot find a single dustbin/toilets in any cities leaving metropolitians. Both you & your Govt., have done nothing sensational to win public trust on you & your Governance.
0 0 Many students coming out of college don't have jobs or proper directions. Career centers should be opened in each district so that proper guidance and roadmap can be shown to students.
0 0 Stop the BPO culture in India if you are interested in utilising youth's talent. I stay in Gurgaon & have seen how young students get tempted for an easy job in BPO & spoil their health working at night with heavy exposure to calls under pressure. At an age when the studies, should be their first priority, they neglect their studies for earning some quick money. Furthermore, Mr Modi, please impose a heavy taxes on Tobacco & Alcohol products in india if you want to save youths. prateek jain
0 0 Career centres should be defined with new functionalities 1) They should act as channels to guide the youth to sectors with potential and space, rather than traditional broker job of liking employee and employer 2) Research into deterrents for youth to become entrepreneurs and provide aid,advise and assistance to promote their ideas into economic activity. 3) Act as bridge between ideas, aspiration to reality, economic activity, entreprenuership.
1 0 One basic problem faced when starting vocational education is knowing the demand of skills in the market. This problem has been solved pretty well by the US with this government website: http://www.bls.gov/bls/proghome.htm I think India can have something similar to inform various entities like educational institutions, planners, Individuals to make better judgments about choosing most effective vocational skills. #CareerCentre, #MinistryofLabourandEmployment, #NationalCareerService, #NSC,
0 0 This is very much true that we are only generating ideas but not implementing it. If educated people are not getting jobs then is it right to discuss job creation? There is not a single site available where people can upload their cv's and a basic lack which i feel is in most vacancy they ask about experience but is it rightious to ask for experience if freshers are not getting chance. I am not blaming anyone but think a bit about the things which need to be done if it could be. JAI HIND
1 0 Generally we blame our government for the backwardness of our society but for this time the  centeral government under the guidance of honourable prime minister Shree Narendra Modi has given us an opportunity to share our views about the proposed carrier centre.Thus we should not miss such opportunity to participate in the development of our man power as well as our society.
0 0 This requires top down approach.When It means-starting from highest place to which a person can reach. Now keep moving down and go up to the bottom level to develop required skills.I see in our country most of labor work is taught as on the job training. In most of cases they join some of trade as child helper.We need to see that they must have proper technical training which must include-required science, importance of tools, use of tools.Incentive given to be used to buy tools or related items
0 0 The career centre should do the assessment of the individual who is seeking employment.This assessment should determine following  things. 1. Level of the knowledge. 2. Attitude and willingness to work. 3. IQ levels required for his chosen field. 4. Guidance and Mentoring. 5 Skill training. With the above things the career centres would largely help the unemployed youth by assessing their competencies,guiding them to acquire new skills to get the jobs. Rammohan
0 0 Site only talking about ideas. I could not find a place my CV. Is there any idea to collect CVs and then according to the skill, concerned authorities to decide how to use the potential of the individuals?
1 0 These #CareerCentre can be a very good idea for social business. As we all know that not only urban population is facing scarcity of skilled resources but also rural area is facing the same challenges. The idea will have two parts: (1) To set up a skill development center in rural area with help of #MinistryofLabourandEmployment , in which training will be imparted on skills like electrician , carpentry, plumbing etc. (2) Develop an APP on which people can call those skilled people when needed
1 0 Separate employment needs of Urban and Rural areas Urban Areas - 1. Bring the jobs and aspirants together. 2. Employ-ability Gap Analysis 3. Industry Exposure 4. Soft skills training and counselling 5. Knowledge sharing with peers Rural Areas - 1. Emphasis on Farming and related jobs 2. Training on better farming techniques 3. Exposure to International Farming practices 4. Knowledge sharing with peers Link Urban and Rural centers to attract people back to Farming and strengthen farming.
0 0 HELLO. EVERYONE. COULD ANYONE SUGGEST ME HOW TO GIVE SUGGESTION IN THIS SITE. I DIDN'T ABLE TO FIND A LINK FOR SUGGESTION. I WANT TO GAVE SUGGESTION REGARDING OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM, JOB SYSTEM. ANY ONE HELP ME. SEND ME LINK AT GARGSPECIAL@GMAIL.COM
0 0 THERE SHOULD ONE EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGE IN INDIA BASIS AND ALL STATES EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGES WOULD BE LINKED WITH IT. ALSO THE STUDENTS CAN ENROLL THEIR NAME FROM THEIR INSTITUTIONS AFTER COMPLETING THEIR SKILL OF EDUCATION. JOB OFFERS CAN BE MADE DIRECTLY TO THEIR MOBILES/EMAILS.
0 0 Sir, #MinistryofLabourandEmployment,1. unorganised labour forms a large part of our work force, they can be helped by having a dedicated repository of drivers, plumbers, masons, electricians, electronic repair agencies, cooks etc, for which Aadhar & basic skill check & documents for drivers & home care givers will suffice. 2. NGO's and SHG's can be co-opted for registering suitable candidates, working in respective field. 3. Mobile app platform should be available, especially for such workers.
0 0 Sir, the #Career centre should 1.cover the nation with unified database that can be accessed by all regional centres. 2. Registrants should be classified based on education level, training, experience & skill 3. Entry based on Aadhar at time of HSC final with possibility of updates. 4. Entry should be based on certification / school / college counsellor 5. Registered work places should be able to access the database 6. A nominal one time fee from registrant & adverts from companies for revenue.
0 0 Sir, "DIESHA" - National Career Guidance Centre, DIESHA - Directorate for Interlinking Employability, Skill development, Higher education and Aptitude. DIESHA - to signify direction.
1 0 admission in center should be free or less fees.... discount should be based on BPl cards not in SC/ST/OBC
2 0 The career centres should be linked with existing infrastructure,eg Post Offices, SBI, KVs. These institutions are having presence to the remotest area of our country. and their infrastructure can also be used at the same time, eg Post offices .Post offices would be the best choice, as they have vast presence and communication based department. Post men can b instrumental in spreading the awareness,they are having good connect with locals and would be good to incentive them. ~~~VANDE MATRAM~~~~~
0 0 Service and Manufacturing industries should be attached to the ITI & arts science colleges( Industrial Training Institute) to keep the training upto date and whats being required. Modern Agricultual related subjected be given as optional in rural areas in 8 to 12 standards at least. Govt should act as facilitator between Industry, Institues and students.Huge online libraries be created with acess to each from college level and free money allowances should not be given to student.
1 0 There should ba a national Portal of Jobs from the government as a part of Digital India.The details of 10 marks and 12 marks should b updated from the board from which the student passes. Also,the marks after 12th should also be updated by the university.This will add more authentication to the data and also the job providers will consider this data much more than that of other job websites. The student should have the rights to add the additional qualifications or creative ability if any.
0 0 The present form of Employment Exchanges has served of no use and as in the case of Planning Commission, this should be abolished. A New Body may be formed at each State where all the Organisations incl8uding Public Sector Companies registered under the Companies nAct, should notify the vacancies , the skill required and also the basic qualifications, experience in the field expected and age restrictions. Based on these information the State Employment Assistance Board, can take further action
2 0 Sir try to develop what we have already...And inspire youth to look forward by giving quality education and provide govt benefits to everyone who are in need...Encourage for hand made materials...
0 0 Revenue model would be full utilization from the organizations who access this DB + those who hire. for the starting since there is a provision of self help in career counselling that has to be free till the applicant aadhaar card / PAN says he is employeed then charge the employeer.
0 0 c. Implementation Agency for Career Centres: Academia infra to be used for opening the visibility of career, Gov should rope in funded institutes / credited Engg + Medical collages. other than specific need based [ minority status ] f. Network of Career Counsellors: first we need career counsellors, well paid & skilled. professional counselling must have grades + record keeping. A searchable and updated database of skills based content via simple DB on cloud with mandatory masking of name
0 0 Branding of Career Centres: Simple GovCareerCentre - GCC, first and foremost if the applicant goes out of India then degree / certificates taken via this is null and void + monetary penalty. b. Coverage of Career Centre: Near district centre as there is connectivity, localizated industries focusing will be there - coal /hydro/ agri,  Women and youth centric have to have different timing. Local Service Providers through Career Centres: Directory of Local service providers like drivers,
0 0 Career center must be developed for human resource tapping center.Human is the greatest asset for a nation. But we indians ignored it,supplies great human powers to other countries.Hence immigration encouraged.To identify peoples embedded skill, right aptitude test being conducted.Each persons have their own strength and weakness.To identify all the skills (physical and intellectual) in the person is the first step towards job orientation.With in six month the center must provide a job to them.
2 0 #roadwaytosuccess The main reason why we end up with wrong jobs or career is the lack of proper guidance at deciding points of our life. In India SSC and HSC are two such crucial stages of our career one wrong step an you end up wasting your precious years. We need to bring #careerguidance mandatory in our curriculum. But that shouldn't be a formality ,Students should be asked to do research on different career options and then discussions should be done on that. #youth #change
1 0 Just Like B-schools design their course as per the requirement of Industry the govt. should tie-up with Industry & develop course as per the requirement of industry also Sign MOU with the industry to employ the people from the Career Centers where the people have quality Skill-Sets . Career Centers should be specific in nature for eg. Center for Tourism Industry , for Auto Industry , for Steel Industry etc .
0 0 Private partners need to be involved to make the career centers more efficient. the government agencies that exist today should be transformed by making it more connected, using digital technologies. #CareerCentre, #MinistryofLabourandEmployment, #NationalCareerService
0 0 There is dire need to motivate rural youth towards farming and encourage them for farm sector activities. So career centers must be opened at Block/ Taluka area and it should provide technological assistance, agri-business, skill development in farm sector and act as job generator in Agriculture Sector. After-all total population may reach 1340 million in 2021 and except Farming sector, none other sector gives you food to survive. Think about it!!!!!!.
2 0 Sir there are lakhs of Govnt.offices in this country,from panchayats to the Navratnas,PSU etc,if the govt. absorbs all the youth based on their interest and qualification and impart them 6-10 month training for a minimum fee.The youths of this country will be in demand for the private sector and self employment,as the start seeing from different angel.It will change the future of this country.Sir please do not open another Gont. office in name of career center to waste our resources.
0 0 computer job coding & a hundred other skills.Tourist guides, cab drivers, auto drivers, any skill taht can be taught must be taught.The admissions and fees may be kept low to enable large scale employability.
0 0 Starting career centres is a must do for the GOI[Government of India].You dont have to go very far for implementing this concept.Just study how NTTF{nettur Technical Training Foundation] does its job.Similarily,the concept of the Indo German Skill development centres of the Government Of Karnataka.Similar skill development centres of short duration can be started for skills lkie electricians, hair dressing, plumbing, borewell mechanics, 2-wheeler mechanic, 4-wheeler mechanics, electronics repair
0 0 There should be career centers in every village because village students did not know about careers other than engineering and doctor fields.Also there should be skill development in school and high school/college.One more thing in village most of the children (banjara samaj,farmer ..etc)are not interest to study because they did not importance of study.In village govt.school/college teacher must be chosen as per best qualification..Computer training program at school and college level
0 0 #CareerCentreDuty #CareerCentre Just like in US citizens have Jury Duty,each citizen shd be go to a CC for 2 days in a year and share their skill with participants. #NationalCareerService should have separate stream 1. Improve Current Skill 2. Learn New Skill For e.g. with e-commerce boom, less educated workers can be easily trained on 4 skills: 1. Improve Current Skill - Driving, Soft Skills 2. New Skill - PLanning Delivery Route, Using Smartphone apps, in a condensed 4-6 week course
0 0 There should be career centers in every state, town, city, village, etc which should impart not only skill development required by their states but also help in generating employment after the training & thus assist in placements which will help corporate india to get skilled labours & minimise their expenditure as no gestation period would be required after employing experienced labors.
0 0 Career center should be categorized such as 1. For students who completes 10th/SSC, so they can pick the skill oriented studies right from beginning. 2. For people who are goalless, they can be literate or illiterate. It should have programs depending on the Regions requirements, literacy ratio. For ex, Career center in Mumbai focusing on Manufacturing will not be as fruitful as Financial/IT program bcoz it is no more Manufacturing hub. Special focus is needed on Agriculture oriented program
0 0 This is an excellent idea.KUDOS to the Government. Please do study the system of skill development in the U.S and may be Japan which have proved their skills to the world. Especially the system of Community colleges in the U.S. is very impressive. In the U.S for e.g. a HairDresser, Carpenter, Plumber all have a certificate that they display in their shops or have it with them.
0 0 Sir why cannot we inoculate the idea or skill development program from high school, so that the child will also have chance recognize his potential , and more over we can borrow ideas from our ancient Gurukul system of education were inclusive growth of child was taken care so when comes out of Gurukul he is ready for anything ....
0 0 Carreer centre must be only in school not other place.This waste of money of country
0 0 Sir, The idea of career centres is excellent.I'd suggest that employment exchanges should be operated in every village our country(Just like gram panchayats).It should be made SSC/10th everyone must enroll with these employment exchanges.Employment must be provided even in the private firms through employment exchanges only. A G.O in this regard must be issued by Central Govt,such that ail the private companies gets registered with these employment exchanges giving vacancies list
1 0 Dear Sir... just attach the ITIs, Polytechnic centres and engineering colleges with Employment exchanges and make it mendatory (as was in older days) that the required manpower in either sector be it govt of private - must be done through these employment excahnges only.
3 0 Dear sir , I welcome the decision for proposed career centers . I would like to suggest that these careers centers should not only be confined to cities , but these centers should be established for every villages which have population over 500 . These center should provide modular skill in every domain related to local requirement , the person attending career center should be given option for earn & learn scheme , where their skill & labour can be used for revenue generation.
0 0 Hello Sir, I am an IT engineer living in Ahmedabad. Due to less no. of IT giants we need to migrate from Gujarat to another state for career enhancement. I would request to promote IT companies to investments in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. There are lots of skilled engineers are there in Gujarat and due to location constraint who can not migrate to other state which may impact their career growth. So my humble request to you to promote IT giant in Gujarat. Thanks, Kushal Sheth
0 0 Respected Sir, Importance given to bring Technology and Management for the basic needs of Food and Clothing need to be improved. Skills need to be imparted in different activities of farming and regular income on a monthly or weekly basis be ensured. We need to make Agriculture as a dignified profession. When Technology can be utilized, need to leverage them. This way we can eliminate wastage of time, effort and ultimately money. Thus make agricultural products less costlier and improve supply.
1 1 As all know there are reservation categories at every steps of Indian life, even the noble profession HEALTH SCIENCE, MAHARASHTRA has 53% category reservation, above MARATWADA, VIDARBHA reservation. Then (my knowledge) why there is no such reservation in LOK SABHA, RAJYA SABHA & STATES VIDHAN SABHA why??? why???? why???????. Respected, P.M. Mr Narendra Damodar Modi Sir Pl. can you give reasons.
0 0 sir first of all please look towards the EDU of disabled persons in India they are  looked down in our country. GOVT schools have no facility for them. their skill are neglecte in each and every school. they are stop in going to tourist places. only 500RS per month is very less for them. as they can't do any thing with 500RS. special schools should be opened by GOVT. for every type of disability. lastly it is a humble request to hold a Man ki baat on problems and needs of these children.
0 0 first of all please change the way of education in government schools because education is only toll to every child buliding futures nation on second thoughts every child get full support from government chossing their own field of choice whether engineer,doctor,cricter,etc
0 0 Center government should open different career centers with the help of state governments in all the states. These centers can be related to computers, Art and Kraft, Electrical works, Film, photography, Agriculture, different languages, business setup and other areas. These career centers will provide the internship to peoples based on their interests and area of specialization and also provide the career guidance. These career centers will help to produce skilled peoples.
0 0 i have a question... we have something called rajive ghandhi rural employment guarantee scheme. Has anybody actually seen it work. has anybody actually know how it functions, does anybody actually audit it. As far as i have seen the work is done by the contractor and he collects the money in the name of the registered labour. cant we have a model that is self contained rather than have the govt fund it. when the govt funds a scheme there is more wastage than they actually helping themselves.
0 0 The primary level education should be strengthened by moving away from rote based learning to activity based learning.Farmers.artisans of villages can be made instructors ensuring they have a job as well transferring there knowledge to the next generation.We have all the necessary institutions to implement this like ITI's and NIELIT etc .New institution will only bleed the funds away from such institutions. Instead.Instead this organisations should be modernized and strengthened.
0 0 Why can't we install a small wind mill in each compartments of trains and use the method of storing generated energy in form of any storage devices.  A small wind mill can turn installed in four corners of each compartment and those energy can be used for running of trains, electricity by saving traditional method. These saved energy can be used instead of electricity for long running distances.
0 0 I am guessing that there should be many patented idea in India, in the field of agriculture: http://www.fnbnews.com/article/detnew.asp?articleid=21480&sectionid=20 Collate them and design a model around it such that it reaches and benefits every farmer.
2 0 Please consider the attachment.
1 0 time has now come to realize that only skill based education can bring substantive change in unemployment rate among youth. such education should start right from schools. every child must be taught basic skills required in daily life like repairing small electronic products, stitching, painting etc.from class 9 -10th so that youth is equipped to handle odd circumstances and apart from theory has some practical knowledge.
1 1 Skill based education to be provided copulsory 3 month internship to be done in milatary for discipline
0 0 For me 1st of all identify the number of unemployment in each Block/Taluka/Mandal level, 2nd thing is that from that list prepare a data base and link with computer, 3rd is that What will done as per their qualification, 4th from that qualification connect with your availability vacancies.
0 0 The aim of a career center should not be to educate youth. It should be to give a life skill to a person. He should be able to provide for his family and himself using that. The career center should assess every person who comes for help and suggest a suitable course. No course should be for more that 4 months. At the end of the 4th month the participant should get a guaranteed job placement. The centers should be run by entrepreneurs and 80 to 90 percent of the course fee should be borne by gov
2 0 Please see the attached PDF.
0 0 Concept of setting up/converting exisitng Employ. Ex. centres to Career Centre is definitely a good initition. But unless we setup such centres at Taluk Levels and exhibiting Skill Course counters(what and to where it is) for rural candidates, we are not going to achive anything extra. Plus creating District level opportunities is atmost important agasint such initiation but we will achive training and skilling but no scope of employbility. Sivananda Choudhury, 9035070604
0 0 A one stop solution is the question both for the needy and the needed. When everything is going centrally, then why not we think for a central and classified employment bank!
0 0 Women suits & tailoring career centers may be established in rural high schools on PPP basis at nominal fees and the career centres may be governed by school authority.After sucessfull of course the student may be employed in big cloth stores or may be self employed at their resion.
0 0 DEAR SIR, ALONG WITH THE EXISTING EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGES, ADD THE PROPOSED CAREERS CENTERS TOO. MODERN CAREER CENTERS ON THE LINES OF AS WE CAN SEE FEW GOOD PRIVATE JOB CONSULTANCIES. HENCE AS SAID PLS SET UP NEW SO CALLED 21ST CENTURY EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGES IN THE NAME AND STYLE AS "CAREER CENTERS". YOU CAN TAKE PRODUCTIVE BRAINSTORMING IDEAS FROM AICTE, NCVT, ITIs, ETC.  THANK YOU
0 0 Career Centre - How to build our future people for the country? Do we know how much talent goes out every year out of country? Rich countries hires talent from India and India (Govt) competes with them. What a wonderful situation:):)
0 0 Career centre should be a onestop shop for all career related queries of students from (+2 to PG) in the area, centre is present . The centre should provide counselling on the various courses/professions/careers available to a student. The counsellors of diff. professional institute's should be asked to counsel at centre and seminars should be organised upon  Career planning. The database of a centre can be shared to interested colleges to follow up with students to help them to choose career.
0 0 Career Centres panels must be chosen from the graduates and post graduates of that field. Create an online voting and awareness program to chose the best from that industry. You can depend on local faculty members also for the same who will be knowing the experts in that field. That way they will represent people of the region and Govt should be appointing a few experts of the field to guide. That way it will be driven by from local community who will be drivng for themselves.
0 0 1. Students must be given free coupons to undertake msme course free of cost. 2. The video material of msme must be uploaded in youtube for all public to learn new things. 3. Training in english and hindi must be made mandatory. 4. Teaching computers should be made compulsory. 5. All must be given training on how to write emails, letters, loan procedure, politeness in speech. 6. Funds must be transferred for transport for those who attend training and dont get job.
0 0 The Career Centers need to guide students by allowing them to assess their aptitude. The industries that are likely to grow very fast, the jobs those industries are going to create, the skills those jobs need, the work environment and life style they provide are all part of Career Centers. How to deal with unemployment, making a resume to applying and also changing careers should also be part of a career center.
0 0 A Career Center should start with parents, as they are the main drivers of their child's future. An in depth analysis is required into evolving industries and likely job creation counts. For example cyber security professionals are going to be in high demand in times to come. Currently India has 100 M users on the internet and is expected to go up to 300 M by 2020 as per govt of India estimates. Aptitude tests are being done by most schools now a days for children.....
1 0 Skill Development program should be included in the school and colleges regular syllabus
0 0 Cross lingual training courses should also be incorporated. North Indians must learn English and Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Malayalam and South Indians can learn Hindi or a North eastern language. Eglish and other foreign language training should also be included.
1 0 After registration on the website  job card which will be available through  mobile recharge shops like mobile recharge coupons  which will sent all notifications on the mobile
0 0 8. training on basic dressing/attire, suitable grooming and cleanliness must be essential part of the course. 9. Skill centers must promote products and services made by trainees for sale/auction/festivals. For example, a Cook trainee can be sent to a marriage function in village to lend a helping hand. A dress designer trainee's stitched dresses can be sold in the village/weekly bazar with his her name tag/center's name tag. Regards Satyarata Tripathy
0 0 7. Every person must be mandatorily trained in communication skill (Practical). They must know how to initiate a talk, how to ask appropriate questions, how to clarify if something is confusing, how to give crisp, clear and approprate answers to the most practical questions on job and in social life.They must be trained on how important it is learn from life and contain unneccessary ego/attitude/inhibitions that generally creep in during small town/village social life.
0 0 5. Classroom training must be followed up by- a. Mock sessions b. Mock/real time on the job session c. City/District Level exams along with practical tests for certifications. 6. The examiner in such practical exams must not be a government officer. He/she must be someone who is a private enterpreneur of any scale. May be the owner of a popular Beauty parlor of the nearest city. This will provide a realistic results before certification.
0 0 3. We must add progressive courses like cooking, basic customer service and Waiter/attendant job, Security services, Housekeeping. A lot of young people come to cities and find jobs in small hotels/eateries, offices as cleaning staff and wahing staff. Skilled manpower in this area shall improve their demand and pay scale as well. 4.Driving courses and first aid courses along with Hygiene training should also be included. They will nt only find employment but also contribute to cleanliness.
0 0 Sir, following are some of the points I have for career centers; 1. The modules or courses must be very basic and practical which touch our routine lives. This is because we are talking about skilling the extremely unskilled unemployed youth/women in small towns and cities and villages.So employment/employability after the course shall be the main attraction. 2. Courses like carpentry, Electrical work, Mobile repairing, Stitching and embroidary, tailoring, hair cutting and salon/beautician
0 0 Dear respected Modiji, I propose a model enabled with technology to provide the "COLE" to all youth in the form of C - Coaching O - Opportunities (open jobs on both government and private sector) L - Learning E - Exposure (through internships with companies, government or with educational institures) this can be further elaborated if the idea is accepted on how to enable this on a digital technology platform based on the selection or shortlisting of this idea.
1 2 As all know there are reservation categories at every steps of Indian life, even the noble profession HEALTH SCIENCE, MAHARASHTRA has 53% category reservation, above MARATWADA, VIDARBHA reservation. Then (my knowledge) why there is no such reservation in LOK SABHA, RAJYA SABHA & STATES VIDHAN SABHA why??? why???? why???????. Respected, P.M. Mr Narendra Damodar Modi Sir Pl. can you give reasons.

1 0 Agriculture/ farming should be encouraged as a career & be developed as an imp industry in public sector. Lands should be acquired / adopted  for this & the youth , especially from farmer/ labour families should be attracted to it by ensuring quality education in agriculture/ horticulture related occupations.The career centers should have tie ups with above agro-industires ensuring direct placement from such educational institutes giving agro-education.This approach will solve many problems.
1 0 to make mass people employable,we have to 1.focus on skill development to grab world wide opportunity thru latest technology access 2.Use Technology in local language 3 Make official accountable for their deeds so that  fair & fast decision is ensured for LAW & ORDER & POWER SUPPLY. 4 start more industry in area where manpower  & other resource is easily available
1 0 Namaste Pm ji, In South Part of India, people dont understand Hindi. So Free Hindi Learning.  Govt recognised Centres for Learning Hindi must be started. Because it is so important to learn Rashtra Basha... In North ad West part of India, English language is needed for progress. Therefore Similar Programmes and Centres should be run to get into Global  market. Jai Hind !

2 0 #CareerCentre Career Centres should ideally act as one stop shop for the job seeker and the job provider. It should ideally have 3 components; Career counselling,(skill bases) Training that should also include basic communication(both oral and written) and computer training and lastly the Opportunity finder. Attached PDF has a layout.
1 0 Save water in future there will be promble for water
0 0 Revenue model: Once these centres are set up it should run by its own. One way of raising revenue is contribution by public voluntarily especially by those who have benefited from this. Right campaign is needed to bring about this habit. A portal for public and industry to provide funds.
1 0 Creating skill development center for Financial literacy and financial management will be best skill development center. At present only 2% of Indian population is investing in stock market. There are only few thousands of properly trained financial planners in our country. Financial illiteracy and untrained financial planners are spoiling faith of common men trying to invest and taking away common men hard earn money. This will create huge employment & fund for "Make in India" vision.
0 0 we should train our youth to learn at least one foreign language. Then we can have official portal of trained, well informed, smart, young and registered tourist guide. So a tourist can book a guide in advance after getting all the information through official website. like is ability to converse in their own language. Then they can be rated by the tourist after completion of the tour. So there will be fair rating and the government can even reward them for the courteous behavior.
2 0 #CareerCentre "Naukri Aaj se"
0 0 Sir, If All the National parties engaged retired (from any Job- Govt/pvt)personnel, youth , housewife etc. for the data collection, social work, to take care of all the individuals i.e. education , health , insurance,skill,educate for all the govt scheme available for them etc development in each village of India by paying them some minimum wages/salary for their services.But appointment should be verified by Collector/Tahsildar /Sarpanch etc (as you think fit) without bhaibhatijavad .
2 0 More focus should be on Communication skills. Even if the student has good skills and talent and if he cannot express it to others then he cannot progress well. I see this is one of the major reason while they are unable to excel well
2 0 The students from various streams like engineering, pharmacy, B.Com, BMS, MBA, etc may be technically knowledgeable but in terms of their confidence, their soft skills and behavioural skills are not employable at all. This results in very low or no campus placement. The students need to be trained on employability skills. This should be on a continuous basis. Right from the time the student enters college and should be made compulsory.
0 0 #CareerCentre the soft skills need to decided by taking into account expectations of Industry bodies like FICCI and CII which will make the candidates more employable.
0 0 #CareerCentre having run a successful career orientation company for 2 years in Bangalore I can safely say that the key to any career centre is to have them divided into different industries and a thorough Industry overview (already have multiple reports) along with salary expectations to be provided to candidates. Along with this, soft skills to be taken up on interest basis and assign credit points for each variable which is then added up to give a final score.
1 0 please read pdf file for more suggestions
0 0 Similarly, B Ed should be made optional for schools. I feel the career centre needs to focus on development of right talent, with or without qualification. We need people with right attitude and knowledge to handle situations than the qualified people who would be sitting ducks. Pls ease the system as well with the career centre.
0 0 These centres can be a medium between employers and prospective employees. Focus for these centres should be to build competencies of the workforce that can be applied to multiple areas, thereby ensuring multiple job avenues and better prospects. Stress should be on the development of softer skills (such as communication and emotional intelligence) and logical thinking for better empowerment of the workforce.
0 0 Dear Sir, Lot of norms for people to get job needs to be eased. I work for education sector and often we don't find people who could be recruited. Either they don't have the required qualification or the talent. For ex, to be a good teacher in colleges, Ph D should not be mandatory. A person with a rich experience can teach better compared to most of fake Ph D holders. But the system doesn't allow them to enter.
0 0 I had very high hopes from India..My idea is why cant Government construct (Job centres) in city center of each and every Malls/shopping complexs, like its very common thing in England...where a person goes and fill the form and give to the job centre..these job centres have tie ups with all the consultants..Its very effective,transparent and time saving thing..every person will get their job based on their skills in their own city..
1 0 Myself Prabhjeet and I am from Gandhinagar(Gujarat).

0 0 Dear Sir, There is huge unemployment among youth in our resource rich regions. I have an idea to share. Your recent coal auction & infrastructure augmentation decisions will generate huge activity in these regions. This will be done only by earth moving n other heavy machinery. This will need number of technicians, drivers & mechanics to make this machinery work 24/7. Make centers in these areas to train young people of these areas in upkeep, handling & repair of heavy machinery.

0 0 Large No of young men and women, particularly in the Southern states, are unaware of the numerous career options available in the Armed Forces. There is a vast population of ex-servicemen in these states whose services can be harnessed by the government to provide the required information, guidance and training to those who aspire for careers in the Armed Forces.Such Career Centres be formed at each district HQ.
0 0 Good morning. It is very expensive, but can do, if want. Maximum youth will enroll in the Defense in all sectors, giving chance to higher studies, % retired after 15 to 17 years of service, then re enter in all govt jobs, public sector, state services and where ever needed.   If any one want study out side the def then given expenses, after take back to defense.   It will create a new generation in the defense and out side.   So more sectors/trades will open and maturing with civil.  Thanks.
0 0 Career for the Students is a major Focus Area. More than the Students , the Parents and the Teachers , need to take up this task for the benefit of the Ward. There is no limitations to taking up a career but individual's aptitude is more important , to be reallised & tapped by the Parents and Teachers. Knowing the aptitude of each student / ward , the Teachers , based on the Academic Courses and the outside opportunities , in consultation with the Parents , who may or may not be knowledgeable
0 0 Respected sir: Ilove my india.because iam a indian.I thank god, because he gave me so many opportunities and talents for improving my career. I am a EX-NCC cadet. So I have great desire to give more ideas for improving studies and the development for orphan and poor peoples those who are suffering and also for NCC cadets,EX-NCC cadets,students police cadets and EX-students police cadets. Thank you sir..
0 0 Honarable Ministry,Following are my views 1)TagLine :myVyavasayMySamruddhi--Objective is Focus on individual and his/her development2)Coverage is National center with State delegation  to reach to  muni.corp.3)Employment Xchange to  remodel with new framework 4)Municipal corporation center to haveinfrastructure of computers,meeting room,counsellers5)Regular interaction with industrychamber,schools,colleges,localsservice providers/directries6)All Manpwr consultantto register with NSC 7)PPPmode
0 0 to provide self business for all unemployed graduate person to finance to low proverty family & encourage to people to do own business............
0 0 I believe the name and tagline should be "AAGRAH-EK KHOJ KI AANT" which means an end to the eagerness of finding jobs.I have chosen hindi as the language as it is the most spoken language in the country but for places where it is not spoken at all, the tagline and name can be translated.This title is apt as the #careercentre aims a providing jobs to people who are eagerly waiting for a job to come their way.
0 0 The Career Centres can tie-up with all the new Companies entering into India via the FDI route and place candidates at all levels and charge fees for the successful placement of the candidates.The vacancies available across the country can be flashed across in a website and across the electronic media
0 0 sir mera name milind hai. mere mann main bohot din se wastu vinimay ke bare main chal raha hai. ager gramin bharat main ye yojna ayegi to waha ki atmahatya rukh jayegi.do udaharan deta hu.1) kisan apna fulli katne ke liye majuri main gehu deta hai.iss se us kisan ko jada munafa hoga 2) jub pyaj ke dam sabse jyada the tub kisan ke pas pyaj tha par us wakt wo tamatar nahi kharid sakta tha. main jub chota tha tub mere gao main wastu vinimay se hi kam hota tha
0 0 -Upon successfully placement of candidates, during the training period (minimum 1 yr), make mandatory system for all candidates to provide 25% of their monthly compensation for generating corpus of funds for these centers for further development and modernization.
0 0 -Ultimate objective is to produce a highly skilled, motivated and ‘ready to deliver’ candidates for all the organizations who has their vested interest to employ such candidates. -Make all organization mandatory to provide their regular inputs what kind of skills they expect from candidates from day 1 and upon getting suitable candidates, offer suitable compensation per skills and qualifications.
1 0 How: -	Thru participation of All Government, Public & Private Companies, Education, FII, DII bodies work together to setup “Centre Of Competence” inside every school, colleges, universities. -	Make this center a self-sustainable organization which can manage their own expenses, develop modules/ courses suitable to their geography, population and surrounding needy job seekers.
0 0 Career Centres;- My proposal - Objective:Job for All in sync with personal interest, learning, fun, near to home/ family, limited hours, growth to earn as much as he can and many more unfulfilled wishes Possible solution:A mechanism which can provide a platform to perform anybody as per its skill and get compensation accordingly but basic facility/ wishes should be avail to all. Model:Employee must feel like an entrepreneur and know hourly value (profit and loss) of their contribution
0 0 j. Revenue model for Career Centres to ensure sustainability. This should be nominal fee based.  All career centres should be given to people who has HR background and psychologist who can become career coaches,  not to be given to politicians and their kins. h. Local Service Providers - use google local searches to find nearest local plumbers, electricians, etc.  This can be accessible by mobile apps for faster access and reach at finger tips.
0 0 b.Coverage of Career Centre:  All career centre should reach the last mile, Village, panchayat. Not to be focused on metros. I.Career Content Knowledge Repository: all careers should be certified by body like IT certification. There should be a central digital repository with biometrics which can viewable by all people who can check and validate before employment.  Employment could be corporates, citizens, govt. bodies. The rates should be displayed and payment can be online.
1 0 First thing is to discourage talents from migration to other countries as a govt employee in another country I can say retain our talent in our country as much as possible to build a technologically proven developed India
1 0 My submission would be to develop and trained individual in their village itself so that they can operate from village itself or else if some contractor or agent is pulling him up in the city he or she is independent enough and is not exploited. Take help of Corporates and NGO's for the same or even this can be made compulsory for the respective MP's and MLA's
0 0 I am based in the rural sector and would like to contribute to CSC model in the villages, thereby creating a dedicated channel for connecting the rural sector with developed India and thus bringing opportunities in areas like education, skill development, crop insurance, weather forecasts (specially for farmers) and linking villagers to various government schemes that can benefit them. Suggest way ahead. Thanks & regards.
0 0 A #CareerCentre should not be a place to train people. It is not possible to create a huge infrastructure to train millions of people and also at the same time keep upgrading the training content with changing times. Not possible. Should do this: - Create a portal/gateway where job postings of every organization run by Govt of India can be searched - Ensure that people get a holistic view of skills that are in demand, location etc - Tax benefits to private players who impart these skills
0 0 Engineering institute focused only theoretical not a practical.Maximum focus on practicals.
0 0 In my opinion, we should organize the labor. We should create the labor data base, So that we should be able o know their employments status. And providing the jobs.
0 0 Practical skills should be developed Experts from all field should be taken for guiding the youth. All state and central government is utilizing most of the part of there income for giving out pension. The skilled pensioners should be used. Peple from privet sector  can also partcipate
0 0 Few Points I would like to suggest 1. A team of Unbiased,Non corrupted Young dynamic professionals from Industry, Education, Service etc (Different Sectors)to be formed. 2. They should be given authority to execute the norms. 3. Implementation of the norms at grass-root level should be monitored thoroughly rather than looking it at superficially. 4. Finally we should focus on Skill based training with employments.
0 0 1. The career centres should work on PPP model with SOPs and benchmarks for operation. 2. Fixed no of institutes/Schools should be allocated to each centre with active encouragement from teachers. 3. Following methodology should be used to channel a candidate to the right career. Aptitude Test > One on one with counselor > Determine Skilling needs > Assign course for Skilling > Certification > Placement/Assistance for self employment > Review after 6 months > Alternate career if required
0 0 Government should dtatrt the training and courses at school levels because in the age of school time children make his career in pressure and show their creativity though the course like if one student have good mind so puzzle proves is memory through his course because in the young age few student hide their telnet due expensive fee of course #CareerCentre, #MinistryofLabourandEmployment, #NationalCareerService, #NSC, #NationalCareerServiceProject, #MyGov
1 0 Hon MP, My ideas: 1.Create Manpower Data-Bank and it's utilization in every sector 2.Create and Invite Woman's/Physically Handicapped for home base Jobs 3.Provide technical training to ambitious layman's 4.Grow idea toward foreign money investments 5.Scope of higher education for working and social backward peoples 6.Involvements of NGO's in projects 7.Educate to become economically more strong more will discuss later.. thanks..
0 0 (2)Final year students should register with Career Centres..Pl. go through the pdf file.
0 0 Career Centre in school makes a vital role for the students to choose the right career according to his/her talent. Career Centre should be start from the Primary school where the student can start to think & choose about his career and prepare himself/herself for his future to serve the nation with dignity. Government should engaged well qualified and vast experience & knowledgeable Centre Head to each Career Centre. Each Centre shall have latest technology with sufficient learning resources.
0 0 All final year students of graduation/postgraduation/diploma courses may be given 3-6 months projects in their final semester in established institutions of the respective areas and due weightage should be given for this. Now also projects are there but most of the students get it done by others/institutions instead of doing it themselves due to which they dont gain the experience and hence in the open market they are unable to exhibit their ability.....
0 0 Like engineering sector, medical sector also needs institutions like ITI where we need to develop two year to three year vocational courses in paramedical and allied sciences for this sector
0 0 Career counselling centre in school will help in understanding the student capacity at Matric level  and can counsel him as to the field in which he can shine.  The student having a desire of chosing his career can be guided accordingly. The legal formalities for starting a business should also be available with the counselling centre.
1 0 Career centers should have - 1. Along with providing career guidance, these centers should focus on imparting skills which are not provided by current educational system such as communication skills, personality development, computer skills, soft skills, basic understanding of finances, general knowledge, economics, marketing etc. 2. These careers centers should have participation from private sectors to utilize best talents available. 3. graduate and undergrad level. 3. These centers
2 0 Better to prepare career centre Region wise/ Zone wise and Geographical patter. Find out the ways to use the waste – Factory, home, new construction waste prepare a Waste management system that will help to maximum utilization of resources. Seasonal career are good and more useful for normal public and that is fully skilled oriented, in summer educate youths for water harvesting and for solar energy. In rainy season educate them preparing water reserves etc. Its for better india.
0 0 Resource centers in each ward managed by resource people of that ward
0 0 HELLo, Its a huge problem for most of the poor student to get job in their profession sector. I am who passed my BCA degree & having 2 years Educational Gap because of money problem & also family problems. So my question is to GOv. Of India that why every Firm of Organization not giving the opportunity to people like us who's having educational Gap. I think we are capable of working in professional sectors and having good knowledge of our Profession. Then why it is so?. Thank you.
0 0 After come out from IT, i am interestingly doing the agri and i want to know latest technologies. By updating i am planning to teach every youth by my ideas and taking the future generation youth to new dimension in agri area. Why always expecting the government to do all the basic necessary? we have to develop our own and as part of group activities we develop our villages like, ground water source, electiricity and labour problem too. But government has to support for financial issues
2 0 1) First step:Provide them basic training to operate in digital india 2) Second Step:Provide them basic business skills along with taxation rules 3) Third Step:Open Collaboration Department which assist all these trained people to collaborate their ideas, capital, resources and manpower to start SME's for ex: 4-5 small grocers can collaborate together and open up a mini Mart or technicians can collaborate together to open a fully equipped service center. We need entrepreneurs, more than jobs
0 0 For the growth of a country both young and old are equally important.We should take all along.NCC present and past cadets can be invited to join in the nation building process.Police alone can not work.NCC cadets are supposed to be disclipne crowd.They can be utilized part time giving them some recognisition and authority to help police area wise to handle law and order situation.
0 0 Professionals from various industries to offer evening coaching class on crash course and professional certificates to be offered on successful completion from career centres. Corporate can define a skill set, select candidates and train them at these centres.
0 0 Career centre to open under watchful eyes of District collectors for micro management. Centres to collect data on skill sets at local level and industry specific. facility of interviews on skype and other mediums. tie up with local entrepreneurs and SME. Recognition of SME who contribute to maximum recruitment. Coordinator to forward CV to respective SME. Surveys and spot audits to remove corruptions. Local NGO support volunteers to make all aware of such centres and benifit.
0 0 this will tackle both the eco problem as well as generage huge employment for self employed youth of battery maintenance and swap service.
0 0 E-bike battery swap service centres in every street. This can be a great source of both self employment and clean energy/env. Today everybody is buying automatic scooters for commute in cities because of traffic problems.this is an opportunity to sell more electric scooters. however battery charging is a problem. if a removable battery in these scooters with a standard form and fit can be standardised across the industry, thousands of local jobs can be created for battery service centres.
0 0 Post Office: Generally post offices close by 6.30 PM, working professionals can volunteer & train interested people as a service to nation. 30 minutes per day is not a big problem to educate a fellow citizen. Existing post office infrastructure can be used. #CareerCentre
0 0 ONE INDIA ONE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN STATE LANGUAGE
0 0 Before giving training to youth, their interest in particular field is to be assessed. Because every body has got some innate interest in some skills. For example some body has mechanical mind that can not be seen in others. It would be more successful depending on their interest in a field they should be fit in and given training.
0 0 Innate skills already present in their genes through their heredity that is caste based, and they can be further trained on that basis. They will learn quickly and shine well in their field.
1 0 II-LONG TERM-1Schools and coll should have a tie up with career centres so as to nurture the skills at the grass root level.2SHGs,NGOs,Civil societies,CBOs should team up to harness talent of fresh grads to create a win-win situation.3Job needs should be fulfilled by recruiting through fair practices monitored by anopen system.4core competencies should be emphasised at the early stage of college life by career counsellors.5Interest based workshops should be organised to help choosing a career :)
0 0 There should be two type of approaches for the proposed career centres: I-SHORT TERM ie; job oriented for the ones who cannot go for long term involvement as their major requirement is money.By giving them hands-on training for livelihood like handicraft,basket weaving,pottery,sweater knitting,candle making,pickles and papad making and like of cottage industry.and giving them opportunities to learn the skill with their job. this will make them self sufficient,self reliant.thus leading to career.

0 0 I hope ull fulfill the need of my above comment I am one of them please do some thing Decrease the rate of properties (Flats).
0 0 Dear Prime minister, Property such as (Flats,plots,villas etc)should not be allotted as an investment because most of the investors are purchasing many of the flats and plots just for invest their assess money because of it people who are home less couldnt buy thier own house because of the increasing rate of properties if government declare that only one property  should be allotted to only one voters or individual so that the properties rate will automatically come down

0 0 I am open a jute skill small manufactring industery so .pls help me
0 0 1) In India first people become engineers or doctor and then identify really what they want to be.So many career opportunities are there other then engineer and doctors. So career centers should be guiding path for all the opportunities. 2) Skilled youth can be on driver seat for growth of India. So first of all make all ITI of India working efficiently and provide big opportunities to the students in ITI.
0 0 Govt, should provide an opportunity to take up public sector jobs based on their qualifications(Merit basis) by making age relaxation 40-45
2 0 Please read the attached file you will get some clarity on the issues behind the unsuccessful skill development programs....... Jai Bharath
0 0 1.Career centers should be like cal centers where interested person can select from list of professionals , decide the time slot and discuss his aptitude.2.It should be like web seminar session.
0 0 Carrier centers is a facility given by the governament mainly for the women upliftment.. in india many wemen cant leave their homes. Govenament should open carrier centers at homes so that they can get their wages as selfemployed. No standard output must be given. All the manufacturing must act like an donation purpose for poor children this will help women as well as poor children who dont have cloth to wear.. this is my thought hope it will be reflected
0 0 First step is to get an almost exact number of professionals,their specification in the field,e.g engineers-total number,civil-?,Mech-? Then find out the demand of the professionals(sector wise) in India we then know how many civil engineers,mech,nurses,doctors are needed in the coming may be 3-4 years. Allot colleges and seat only according to the need. Enhance the relation with the industry and the colleges. Colleges and universities along with gov has to invest more in researches.
1 0 #MinistryofLabourandEmployment Unorganized agriculture and contract labors should be able to get registered in “some agency” to get training and facilities like ESI, PF etc
0 0 Carrier counseling4 any young man becomes crucial at stage he is undergoing  graduate studies.Sometimes even before the graduation. That is the time one needs someone who can advice like a peer and a friend  without being high handed. It for this very reason- as far as possible-the PHD guys(most of them do for Naukri )should be KEPT OUT.Retired academicians  are better but even among them  one has to be careful in grooming the ones who are down to earth,friendly,Knowledgeable(not just literate)
0 0 Career Centres: SMEs Agency: Employment exchanges Office Stipend: Tax incentive for SME or Government Stipend Role of SME: Practical work and training like internship or apprenticeship
0 0 Career counselling should be down from class 7 onward as we start framing out life goals from that time.In villages after class five computer paid employment should encourages where small projects like making ppt,making online cards,coral art can be initially taught and can be used for earning living.I believe in this way we can overcome school dropout and also encourage education.Increase knowledge about student loans and education funds.CAMPASING SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED FOR ALL FIELDS
0 0 Career Centers idea should be initiated from the colleges and universities where pretty soon leaving batch would be ready to take up a job. Initially, train them to try freelance working online which can groom them into bright professionals for the real working needs. I can offer training on this to make them ready to take up freelance working. This is a better grooming for the passing out gradates to face the real job world. Every state in India should try this without fail and it helps youth.
1 0 1) Convert the existing network of ITI centers into Career Centers 2) Enhance them with latest equipments, labs and computers 3) Leverage them as incubication centers for start-ups right from and at all village levels 4) All the IT product companies to provide free licenses / trial versions of software products / platforms 5) Leverage the labs to learn and develop the mobile apps and software products 6) Promote the Green product developments 7) Govt can market & Promote these products
0 0 Career Centers. 1.The proposed Career Centers should be established on village level or Constituency level and not in big Metros. 2.Each center should have different small scale job training with full practicals.3. Must have necessary workshop with training infrastructure and Instructors.4. Those passed 10th or above should be eligible for admission.5.Subjects like sewing, air conditioning, welding, patient care etc to be taught, Certificate/employment help given.
0 0 I have suggested for service tax 1 per. For labours in various sector working in india.
0 0 Dear sir as per my view we need establish a skill development  centers all over india & must be monitor how it works give the target to trained youth month wise than we can get the result we have to be very serious because this is our prime minister dream for the youth because as per survey india have only 3% skilled youth population and koria like small country have 92% population have skilled so that we have to be very carefull and committed ,defiantly we will do this is the right way.
1 0 j.Revenue model for Career Centres to ensure sustainability - Registration and Renewal of Registration fee from Employers & prospective Employees Placement fee from Employers & prospective Employees Advertisement revenues from Employers for ads on Digital interface of career centers as well as brick & mortar Canteen facility, Xerox and other utilities Commercial lease income from space above / below as applicable to other commercial establishments like Bank ATM, Food shops etc
0 0 First we should generate the right jobs as per skills. One bakery wala and 1 normal shopkeeper earns more than a B-tech fresher ? The company's come to NCR region for college placements gives very less salary compare to what they offered in Karntaka's colleges and if you see cost of living in NCR and Bangalore both are same but NCR people works at very less package compare to Bangalore also growing opportunities are very less in NCR.
0 0 I believe that an effective market place where everyone can find and post jobs should be created, using robust IT solution. Create a solution which will work like a stock market. 1. Employers will register and post their current future workforce needs with locations and skill sets along. 2. Government should enroll job seekers into the system and based on availability and future outlook skilling and job enrollment should be managed. This will help to gauge the demand and prepare the supply.
0 0 sir like Village adaptation scheme by Our MLA's if our each educated govt officers adapt a school to encourage,inspire the rural students who never know what to achieve at the right time by telling their own journey of educational life isn't that will be sufficient enough to boost youth participation by the correct children's who actually knows what problems they are suffering in our India while having their education and than there will surely be a tough competition in all fields by all indian.

1 1 Ten years back because of zero budget there were no recruitment in govt.sectors. Many females who were educated but not able to join anywhere.As per our surve teachers jobs are vacant in many schools in India. Females can guide and teach the kids than the male. Make any new policy and arrange open exam for females without any age limit. After examination and interview selection appoint the females whose age is more than35-40 years. Mother is a best teacher and friends.Open carrer option for all
1 0 government should have data collected from District Industries centre of each district of state.As per the industries in  area vocational training centre should be established.their are areas were engineers available but no units for absorption of those qualified people.rural bpo and retail marketing should be done in areas where their is big potential for rural /semi urban population.minimum of training and maximum jobs.
0 0 Firstly the improvement needs in the area of basic education system if the child got the right education with proper guidance from teachers he will learn better because if you see the difference between education from State board, education from CBSE Board and from International board. Written exam system should be replace by practicals and project works. The education system should be more practical. The student should know the things practically more than from the books.practical-70%.Theory30%
1 0 jis prakar 9th class se science, commerece & art ki class hoti hai . usi prakar kisi bhi trade ki skill development ki Class honi chaiye. uski manyata highschool & Intermediate class ki tarah honi chaiye.
0 0 OUR ITI Instititue manage as a IIT Institute . there are no problem to skilled worker.
0 0 Baniya shop as all people of different strata goes there
0 0 Career pursuance without skill & competence, is useless. Hence, in order to increase the skill & competence, we need to open the doors of industry to the people aspiring for jobs. Presently, our youths are in want of an opportunity to learn the skills & be competent. Our existing education system does not make them skilled. Hence in the existing schools & colleges, we should open the career centres equipped with such facilities at the basic level which can be absorbed by industry.

0 0 Educational Institutes like College and schools are the best common centers for Career Centers. However, Institutions should be equipped with counselors. Unemployed youths needs a counsel. Later the information regarding exam patterns, filling application form (online), tips for interview should be considered.

If anybody wants to learn certain thing they need to go to that center.For e.g anybody wants learn Bandhani Making they can go to that center

1 0 I believe that these centres should start with schools. Most schools do not have a basic career counselling facility or mentors. All the CBSE schools could be brought into the network where in they can share resources, best practices and ideas. Government could provide schools with some financial or other resources so set up the career centres in the school. If individual schools can't do it then a group of schools together can join hands for the same. Amit Khandelwal
0 0 at least one central ministry, out of 70, be converted as 'ministry of business facilitation(MOBF)'. this MOBF should launch national campaign to train/support at least one crore youth every year on how to initiate business in MSME sector. it should also create regional centres at state capitals for placing all regulatory system of centre/state/local govt at one place and try to reduce/repeal those which are forcing potential entrepreneurs (and job creators) to become clerical job seekers.

0 0 Till now the focus of career related programs and activities is on well educated or skilled persons, but we have a major junk of uneducated, little educated & unskilled people. They also need employment. The career centers must also pay attention to them and arrange for very short term training of one day to a week duration (ex. training of mason, floor-polishing, wall-painting,packing, re-packing, etc.)so that they can get better and round the year employment or self-employment.
0 0 #Career Centres Further, the scope and ambit of examinations conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) should be expanded. Currently there is no direct opening for central government jobs for law graduates as no All India Level Examination is conducted by UPSC for law graduates on the likes of IAS, IES, IFoS etc. This should be taken into account.
0 0 Besides inviting ideas for career centres and also inviting applications for registration of job seekers, the government should ensure fairness and transparency in examinations conducted by State Public Service Commission and also ensure that they are conducted in a time bound manner. It would be better if instead of registration of job seekers at proposed career centres, jobs are provided to the youth by conducting examinations by public service commissions in a fair manner.

Immediately the Government may introduce the submission of AADHAAR number in all private and government offices. This is the one and only way to reduce the corruption and all sorts of criminal and illegal activities in India.GOOD LUCK MODIJI.

1 0 Government employees do not perform because there is no incentive attached to performance. Their salary increse is unjustified too. There is no gaurantee that they are of good moral character either, as is evident from the level of corruption in the country. There should be provisions to fire non-performing employees from a critical jobs such as government, without which no government can say that they are doing justice to the people of this country.

0 0 India's private sector is doing great since many years, but the govt sector isn't as good at all. All govt-only offices should be made semi-private and semi-govt, so as to reduce corruption, improve work efficiency and improve profitability of government run companies/offices. There is no means to complain against any govt official or procedure, as the regional RTI is not online yet. #Privatization

0 0 Using Multiple intelligence theory, Benefits are: You may come to regard intellectual ability more broadly. Drawing a picture, composing, or listening to music, watching a performance -- these activities can be a vital door to learning -- as important as writing and mathematics.

These are complex ideas but will definitely provide more channels to provide jobs for Indian unemployed youths

2 0 As per my view, steps should be taken in the area of education.Strict policy must be implemented from the process of admission to the nursery class to higher education. Every sector should be made technosavy and from the initial years the child should be taught to use the computers. The burden of the books should be reduced. It is a high time to change in the curriculum framework and National Policy Of Education. Its a need of an hour.
0 0 I think Resources are limited in our country as compared with Population. our main Problem is with population. if we control our population then everyone should get opportunity to get educate and get good job.why any one politicians or famous personalities never talk about controlling population. about Education system mainly politicians opened their colleges and approved them by  use of their political contacts. so their should be a one body which includes bureaucrats and members.
0 0 Let us open up volunteers to participate to enable upload resume of applicants and also to contact right employers. In the website, there should be both job seeking people and job providers. It should be updated every five minutes.

All should register them selves for reducing rush and easy system maintenance. I'm in HR field, so i get so many calls & walk in, but feel sorry for not able to help. For people like me searching suitable candidate & also putting my profile on board will help both ways & a platform for job hunt.#Careercentre.

0 0 #DrivingResponsibly - We need to do anything and everything that would help our countrymen to come into a practice of disciplined driving (read lane driving) and would encourage the safety of all.

0 0 If we assign engineers to work in this sector or any other sector, it's a profit for everyone. Engineers will get jobs, second thing is that, farmers will get the refined supervision of engineers which in return will end up with a very good output from the fields.

0 0 Sir, now a days everyone wants to be an entrepreneur; so why cannot we take this as an opportunity to boom up our development. My goverment has a lot of task to do. it has to take care of everything. Basically i want to say that the scope of my goverment is very vast; hence there are chances that some of the factors might get missed (farming is one of them). What i believe, why can not we give chance to the top engineers from diffrent universities, to work in this sector on behalf of my govr.

0 0 Assess the potential, skills of the person, instead of degree, and nurture the same if required, for development of the person and nation. Getting a degree is not a big deal. But skills are rare because they are not acknowledged at right time and gets diluted with time. Promote self employment, entrepreneurship, so that people can think and decide on their own. Job in an MNC may just kill the true skills of a person by the balance sheet driven strategies. This is my personal experience.

This will boost and enhance creations within the country. This will motivate Indians to innovate within the country and will significantly reduce brain drain. #Careercenter #nationalcareerserviceproject

2 0 Most of the Engineering Student are unemployed in our country.Due to Other Qualification Students are chance to place in Engineering Field.So avoid that things all the student will get placement
1 0 This country can't grow up until our government teachers are encouraged to teach the students properly as most of the our government teachers don't teach well in the schools and force the students to join their tuition centers. That is the main reason most of the parents rather prefer to send their children to private schools. If our children get the balanced education in government schools, we neither need tuition nor we need any private schools in that case.
0 0 I wonder why no body has mentioned about APTITUDE TEST! The career center MUST have facility to carry out APTITUDE TEST of candidates registering for the same. It will help everyone identify their strengths and weaknesses. Choosing the right training is possible only if we know what that person can excel in. Also, the training should be as customized for everyone as possible. It is possible only when we take a small test as well as interview to know about abilities of the candidate.

4 0 Everything is possible, If we are want to do something for solving the particular problems. Firstly Our Primary Education Centres(School) have not the Modern Education.

So We go back not Ahead until we will not do something for Equalization of Education for All. And good teaching is the solution of this problem. VIDHYA DADATI VINAYAM.
0 0 I would also like to suggest some short period courses of 1 to 6 months related to Computer Programming, Ethical Hacking, Core Banking And Finance, Gaming, Android App Development, Basic English Education For Beginners And Advanced English Education For Learners.
0 0 There are lakhs of senior citizens who can do paid or voluntary work.Regrettably, there is not a single agency which looks after this aspect.What is given is MERELY assurances.That too stopped after budget exercise is over.I myself gave suggestion in this regards on 24 sep 2014.Not even acknowledged by PMO office.Apathy has to give way to positive ,proactive action.
0 0 There should be some independent exams, open for everyone who have had 10+2; that don't require you to study from an institute. One can simply pay a exam fee and take the exam.Your score can be helpful in jobs. I would personally like to see - "Independent Exam For IQ" , "National Mental Ability Test" , "National Personality Test" , "Test Of English As A Secondary Language", and various exams related to BANKING AND FINANCE and different computer programs or aspects like TALLY,PROGRAMMING,DTP etc
0 0 Firstly there should be an education system common for all. It should not be like that a poor could not get better education due to his/her financial backdrop. Quality #education should be provided. For those from rural unable to access #internet there should be special cells  in respctv city/town were people feeling themselves eligible for trainings and studies could register, and govt should help help them to learn and grow financially. This will lead to an educated society with will to work.
2 0 there is should be correct awreness of jobs available in all sector of government through online sources and all interview proces should be made through computerized system........ ie atleast 95% no human involvment
0 0 One employment exchange online and it should be updated by Schools and collages after candidate get his degree and all govt. project should approved to many people or many small companies instead of big companies (I.e. 1000 Km. road made by big company instead of 10 small companies made 100 K.m per company or civil engineers) local products get standard with strict quality control to prevent multinational products and it is done by get support from our top business men who invest in local brand.
1 0 First of all I would like to explain about the primary education in rural area particularly in small villages where poor families lives. Their children are depend on primary education nearby village. So that a primary teacher should be more awareness about children as they are locally adopted. It is to said that Primary education begins with hope and become a good citizen of nation. Fortunately teachers leaves their duty place early without seeking proper permission.

Second Learning with doing m ethology will create. Third Provide Better Education in Rural areas. Provide education like all candidate get the better job with better skills development.
0 0 First Education is need to centralized. Today is write time for start online education with one common language and course is displayed online in all class rooms and then all Indian students get help to learn same time same days and it is also benefited to those students who not able to present in class rooms and education goes to cost effective and accurate.

3 0 UP Govt ne Labtop bata tha. If you start free 2 month certification course to all 10+2 pass out student than it is more appreciable and beat the laptop scheme of up govt. It will create a positive effect in youn generation as well as parents
0 0 Instead to thinking about new things i feel what ever exists should be upgraded and made strict. Example, employment office which many local people trust should be strict and active. To my knowledge i feel the employment office is quite dormant and slow. New focus areas should be added based on technology change and training should be provided in career centers.
1 0 TAFE South Australia has a gr8 Vocational training system. Identify needs of each city, set up a centralized academy, match personality types, natural skills, ability, lifestyle expectation and desire to career choice (vocational - electrician, plumber, mechanics of all sorts, tailors, house-help, drivers, call center executives, security staff), sign up with naukri.com, find jobs, part of the salary goes towards paying off the training fee, free counseling available to maintain the job.

1 0 #CareerCentre Career centers should also function as a marketing agency for region specific goods. 1. It will generate income for sustenance of career centers. 2. Youths in career center will get direct exposure with intricacies in marketing of goods, which will help them to become entrepreneurs in a short time. 3. Marketing of regional goods increases the income of local people. 4. Increases the importance of Indian made goods. 5. "Make in India" campaign will gain momentum.
0 0 #CareerCentre Career centers should not be restricted to degree holders, instead it should be open to all youths striving for development. Centers should have interaction with nearby institutions such as rural schools, workshops etc... to give exposure to people at all strata. Integrating the nearby Small scale and household companies with career centers will help to create confidence in budding entrepreneurs.
0 0 #CareerCentre Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR) can be instrumental in this project. Industries and service sector companies can be made obliged to provide internships, Junior fellowships etc.. to youths from unprivileged groups. This will give preliminary industrial exposure to all our youth before they enter the job market or venture a business. All companies must include a page in their website for this purpose. This will become worlds largest internship program for skill development.
1 0 Continuation of local skill register..... Local Skill register = postal Pincode wise skill record

0 0 #CareerCentre Since soft skills are essential for professional interactions and proper understanding among communities. Academia and social media outlets should be integrated with career centres to disseminate professional skills. A website and an app must be developed for this purpose.
0 0 #CareerCentre  It is unfortunate that most of the ingenious inventions of our people are named frugal inventions and are neglected without due consideration. Hence all career centers should also function as innovation centers to adopt and develop this technologies. All career centers throughout the country should be linked into a single network of knowledge sharing platform. Through this platform all innovations must be shared throughout  country for optimal use of nation's resources.
1 0 I would like to open the subject straight away which talk about the career centres synced with some innovative reuse and recycle methodology to create jobs all over the country. Every big or small set up of waste producing and not organizing it's disposal properly, must be made compulsorily run a reuse or recycling unit employing 8 to 10 people as vocational training program and after certain period it becomes a sister concern of the main unit or can become BOT--Build -Operate -Transfer.

0 0 WHY NOT ABOLISH RAJYA SABHA.? We copied British System of Parliament. There they had House of Lords,so we have Rajya Sabha.they have House of Commons so we have Lok Sabha. In having House of Lords, Britishers had no choice, it was their MAJBOORI—they were phasing out feudal system and slowly entering into Democratic System.but in having Rajya Sabha, we were copying them because of our mental slavery . Cant we abolish Rajya Sabha through a constitutional amendment, if it is an obstacle?

3 0 Dear Sir, I have been thinking about the plight of armymen who are retired & are working in many companies as security guards. Actually after getting lot of disciplinary training and good habits, they have to work in jobs which neither create any value nor help the society. These people are extremely good if they are trained in a job of traffic policemen. This will help increase discipline on the roads. Many additional benefits can be accrued by government through this move.
2 0 sir, i have a planned  idea due to some schools in every locality the base of students are not much good of low class my suggestion is that in every locality there are lots of children whom goes to private school, make a system that educated unemployed person teach 10-20 students at their place of locality instead of private school thats make the solution of unemployment and also good base structure of study, and also reduce the transport pollution & thats make difference

2 0 Creating of centralized employement exchange database and physical branches at mandal level.These branches should act as career centers for unemployed youth for registations,training & guidance.These exchanges should play a vital role in sourcing the skill set from the market by reaching every nook and corner of the mandal and develop the necessary skills at root level that is required for the job industry.

4 0 Naukri.com is an example in the domain. Government should digitalized employment office and registration should be open for virtual level too. Government can adopt PPP mode for the solution further these employment centers should connect with government PG colleges. Lot many ideas can be endorse in planning for such model.
2 0 the main reason of the decrease of quality of our education is the avoidance  or underestimate of the post of teacher . The teachership is not so much attracting as compare to other profession .
1 0 Idea behind the career centres is good . But my suggestion is that from the schooling itself  provide quality to education. Now our education system is not up to the mark actually ( except IITs IIMs.) the increasing number of universities and colleges will not fulfil the quality of education.Inclusive of these kinds of career and skill development programs as a part of formal education system will help next generation and our nation will be on top

6 0 Respected Sir, I would like to drag your attention towards reservation in the field of education. As I am attached to the same system and i feel there should be no reservation on the basis of Caste in spite of this it should be on the basis of Financial Position of the candidate. I use to see those who belongs to OBC, SC & ST quota they are availing all the advantages of the system but not deserving. Against it those who belongs to General Quota, deserving but not getting any assistance
1 0 Today, i was searching faculty profile, i found that we depend on knowledge-less people, they don't teach proper any subject. so we don't have perfect knowledge of any subject. students are facing trouble and government getting vote. first we should requite fully qualified teacher they should able to give proper direction to students. government should evaluate performance of teacher every three year, if any on found work-less then government should give some training that case..
2 0 What exactly we need is 'the development of skill for employment' not degrees unnecessarily M.A, B.A. M.Sc. B.Sc. B.Tech etc. Education should be redefined in terms of personal development not as a tool of 'naukri'. We need to stop the production of 'white elephants' from our schools and universities. And the last but the most important thing that GOI must do: Assure and insure the future of agriculture and motivate the youth to go for agriculture as it is the primary source of our existence.
0 0 for village students who have income less than 1lakh ,provide free education,if we do this after 5 years we find the developed india

0 0 For better skill development the existing infra of engineering institute can be used instead of opening new iit's and iim's because this would result into new scams and we should focus on improving skills of faculty in engineering college which make in turn skilled and knowledgeable work force for better india............
3 0 Hello ! Sir I've B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering and i am interested in CIVIL SERVICES EXAM (UPSC) but there are no subjects related to  Computer Science & Engineering. Can we add any subject related to this. I think it is true that without IT(CSE) we can't progress of our INDIA at world level.
0 0 hi , i am milind, i am jobless person first think people don't know which field going to best career. second think each person giving knowledge for education.
0 0 I believe we need to implement major reforms in our educational structure to have the better skill & opportunities in all sectors. Academic qualification should interlinked with the professional qualification. If a child wants to be a doctor then his/her academic education should start with including all professional aspects with the academic one.
1 0 A very good initiative by Government. But rather making investments in this primarily should target the schools as mandatory career period in secondary section, where by this subject will especially be managed by government. This will help maintain the quality. And the first initiative for the career Gov, should take is keep an audit at present for gov schools. Lets, first bring equality in private and government school education quality and start this project at equality.
0 0 Providing them with job would not solve the purpose instead training should designed in such a way that they become self reliant and proud citizens.Career Centers should focus on bringing out talent and interest from individuals. Holistic objective should be to provide them confidence so that they can get prepared for their last job. Emphasis should be given on developing soft skills. Region specific occupational training can be provided to them in addition with training on work ethics.
2 0 One Career Center should be there in every district. Career classes should be made mandatory in schools and colleges. An online website mentioning all the sectors would be a good initiative. Experienced professional should be asked to share their views about their experience in that field, their likes, dislikes and how far do they think this field will go.
0 0 Might be an idea to follow the way Job Centers operate in England and Wales. Not one but many many in each district and town. Possibly a center locally for a population of every 200-300 students to avoid mad rush. It should be a place with facilities and resources that can guide and provide aspirants with available training opportunities, job opportunities locally and regionally.
0 0 Qnet is an awesome oportunity to each and every person my journey with Qnet is just 3 months but it's really life changing org. Not only that but also creating best opportunity for entrepreneurs.I am very lucky of part of this org
1 0 Let people stop fighting for few jobs.Let everyone get to know about various opportunities that will remove unemployment.eg setting a football school or y can't a farmer given pay to give lecture on agriculture for youth.Let's have a broad mind
1 0 Employment or self employment 2 For engineering and technical education college are more but quality education is problem several college don't have workshops teaching staff and only on theory basis it is not possible to get job so strict guidelines require to implement otherwise unemployment defiantly increase because now a days quality is focus and if don't have quality you will be isolated so first take review of all technical college and if don't have infrastructure close it  also base of
1 0 Basic things is we have to change as per requirement of market and government the syllabus in our country is based on past in which all old method of education as replace to market conditions 1 Changes require in basis of new features as B A B Com BSC has need major syllabus change because 70% of student takes admission for such course and majority of employment from this section so sandwich pattern should adopt and same time some skill development course add to this syllabus to increase
3 0 Guidance on self-employment and entrepreneurship is again very good initiative. If proper guidance and training is provided in career center by train professional as per job seeker skill then it would give 110% sure shot successful career to our people. Request please give age relaxation to all. As  per daily need expenses, in  private jobs their is nothing called pension nor future medical expense and illness cover govt. nor company provides after retirement. job will serve all till we works.
1 0 This is very good initiative taken up by govt., certain points need to be checked here, after job seeker registration, if as per job seeker skill if proper training of one week is given in NCS then it will be 100%  sure shot successful career for any body. I request govt. not to involve NGO's self help group, BDO in this. I noticed what they present and show in social circle and in media, they never work what they present. so before taking any NGO, govt. please check facts n figure.
3 0 Career Centers and Technical schools for development of skills on the German model are the same idea and GOVT of India should take help from German GOVT on this basic Programme.

0 0 #CareerCentre First of all we need to identify the problems that we are trying to solve by creating crowdsourcing career centers.  Meaning are we creating transparency between job seekers and recruiters.. Is it for government careers or private or both.. is this to avoid bribe channel in government sectors ?..initially we can start with 1. creating global job posting portal for all government sectors 2. crowd sourcing job recruitment portal that can match qualification and suggest jobs
0 0 Take a look at this video see what China is doing to its roads.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTrg9fTJvmA Can we start planning ahead and build roads to avoid jams?
0 0 1. Suggested Name for career centre:Pragathi Margadharshak 2.Trained career centre officers could organize seminars in schools/colleges with focus on following key points: The students be made aware of job/entrepreneurship development opportunities available by pursuing educational programs other than mostly preferred B.E./M.B.B.S.,. Awareness be brought on various vocational training programs offered by various government institutes, training provided by MSME development institute, C-DAC etc.
0 0 It's a great idea to create a job portal with opportunity to apply online. Original certificates can be produced at the time of interview. It would be very user-friendly and inexpensive. No need to run to post offices who often offer poor service.

1 0 Sir Creat two centers in two different ministries. First Center for Domestic Placments Under the ministry of Labour Second Placment cell under the Department of Foriengh Labours. It will give us clear picture of required man force under one umbrella.
1 0 Why not have career centres for older retired or middle age people? Especially nearer urban centers where cost of living is high and children might not be able to look after parents. Also,  elders can contribute so much to society.
0 0 What personally noticed that a B.E. who's going to complete his degree by the next few weeks don't even aware of the problem our technical industries facing & on which challenges to be solved for the growth & development instead of being an expert in it ... Sorry for this but are we making well 'educated' stupids ???
0 0 Respected Sir... I am doing my engineering now . And I have noticed some serious issues that are responsible in failure or we can say .. 'Defective Engineers !' I know India was & is a peak of knowledge & versatility but though this 'real' & modern knowledge is only limited to the IITs & IIMs ordinary colleges don't have the mentality to offer the modern research topics in our daily routine all we daily notice is that we are in the colleges just for taking good marks !

0 0 In order to make these career centres efffective and result oriented they must 1)provide career councelling at two stages-after 10th std and after 12th std. 2)every student and every school must be covered ,even students completing studies privately must also be brought into foray of discussions and talk seminars. 3)these centres must converge students ,schools,universities all over the nation and abroad so as to disseminate information regarding various competitions held.
0 0 AS I HAD MENTIONED EARLIER IN SKILL DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES WHEREIN USE YOUNG SKILLED YOUTH AS YOUNG RESEARCHERS FOR STUDY, DEVELOPMENT AND LEARN OFFICIAL JOBS, FIELD JOBS ETC FOR TWO YEARS OF INDIAN SERVICE. CREATE A SPECIAL PROGRAMME COMPULSORY FOR ALL INDIANS HOW IT IS DONE IS SINGAPORE IT WILL WORK IT WILL CREATE INDIAN AWARENESS AND DEDICATION. TRY THIS IT WILL WORK. RGDS RAM
0 0 Every school student should be given a minimum level of skill so that if required he can earn a bit & support his family or can continue his studies . I've seen students of KVs frustated due to lack of skills & unable to continue his studies. After spending 12 years in school if one is unable to sustain himself then something needs to be changed.
0 0 Sir as ypu rightly said our schools can play an important part in skill development .schools should be used as  career centers for poor students to make them skilled. Our kendriya vidyalas have good infrastrutures & therefore can be used as computer education for poor children , chemistry labs should be used for soil testing etc.
0 0 Govt should encourage all call centres in small town like Ludhiana Jammu  North east etc .atleast govt psu can run their centres from these cities like Indian oil  Gail gas  IGL  air India etc govt should  centres for good communication etc

0 0 I believe instead of opening up a center is an advance step however people of particular locality must be fully aware of what the government planning for that.  There should be skits first and let people understand as what and why it will be beneficial for them and how.
0 0 If we want every one should get benefit of career centers with skill development. My Government should open career centers at every local area/mohalla with admission for every illiterate and above 15age also including various kind of small skills, works, trainings for skilled helpers and labors with practical knowledge.
0 0 Career centres should focus on a) making every livelihood a respectable career b) channelising the right talent to the right career c) Providing the deserved breakthrough for the talented d) Delinking monetary gains from career scouting e) Provide window for grievance redressal post placement f) Eradicate bureaucratic approach as well as conman approach on the career needs of another
0 0 Private placement providing fake institutions should be banned. Government may come forward and take initiative of this thing. Government agency may tie up with private sectors and provide students details to them as per their requirement. Government should start such agency. Government is taking good care of education but what after that?
0 0 give the chance to youth for entrepreneur..
0 0 1. Career centres must collect data of youth in their area and then categories this data according to different skills. Then contact various private agencies and ask them to select talent from these available skills. 2. Career Guidance seminars must be organised to time for youth of different educational background at block and district level. 3. Entrepreneurship training must be provided by such candidates for the youth, so that they can produce jobs for others.
1 0 PLEASE ban those private institutes who make fool of people & take money without giving proper education to them . Because many students take admissions there & about 80% are middle class, they had to suffer after this. #PrivateInstitutes #Fake

0 0 In every single sector and office of the government, if you digitalize the work, then, eventually, there will be lot of opportunities and scope for almost every kind of roles and responsibilities. Also, I would like to add that interview process needs to be more transparent for selection of any post. Second, please choose the deserved candidates.

College / School which has computer courses should ask all student to enroll into mygov.nic.in and rewarded if post good idea.

Industries, factories and companies to train them and absorb them in their area of work. Their skill to be developed in the best possible way. Their registration and employment needs to be taken care by the career center. This will be a huge step in transforming life of the individuals.

There are million aspirants who would be delighted with this opportunity.

1 0 Dear Sir, One Idea of Digital India which may resolve many issues including finance issue for government is to make each city a free wifi city. And if anyone wants to use free wifi then he or she has to fill a detail form giving field of interest, education qualification and many more. Then let the big companies pay government for sending advertisements to the users as per the interest. Just like Yellow Pages.

0 0 Suggestion for Pregnant women in IT sectors.I am IT engineer.As everyone knows private companies generally not worry about employee issue as most of the companies in India are not employee friendly.My main concern adding flexi timing(reduce the working hours(6or7 hours)in Maternity Benefit Act, 1961.As pregnant women cannot sit for long working hours as it is harmful for mothers,As the new born babies are future of our upcoming world.Please take the measures for the good of society and women.

0 0 In govt offices due to a 9 to 5.30 time, people are now suffering from time pressure. It will be very helpful if SAFAL shops selling vegetables, milk and bread etc be opened, high class gyms and canteens be opened in offices for which interested people will pay a nominal fees, yoga classes be started in offices so that people want to come early and stay late not due to biometric pressure but due to their own wish.

0 0 In our country most of the government schools do not have the adequate facilities. The children who can afford money are going to private schools. So the poor are still lacking in their education and their right to education.Therefore all the government schools should brought under National Career Service (NCS) and making them world class educational hubs. Introducing neighbourhood schools makes the quality education.
0 0 Career centres for beggars and helping them earn money by working. Not teaching them skills like plumbing but introducing them to marketing and art. Teaching them skills and giving them a business sense. getting them in touch with companies and MNCs. Taking money from MNC for recruitment or taking a 10% cut from the persons salary or the profit frm d previous salary for a certain duration to sustain the centre.Establishing like the polling booths. Start frm single state then expand #NSC #MyGov
0 0 A centre for the slums. there is so much talent in slum areas which is going wasted. These centres will help them develop their micro businesses and help them earn money and make them aware of different strategies. This center wont focus much on skills but mainly design thinking and building strategies. Having a 'Mela' in the end and displaying their work and helping them get in touch with investors. Gathering some money through the same mela by collecting tickets and having sponsers #NSC #MyGov
0 0 Maidaan-Zindagi ki Daurh (race) mein sabse aage A centre focused towards students of class 10th and introducing them to different unconventional courses like arts & design. At the same time introducing them to jobs like plumbing and electrician and explaining how its not only the poor who do it. Using the platform to erase stereotypes of different working and economic groups. Having workshops for parents and making them aware of different courses fr their kids. #careercentre #NSC #MyGov

0 0 Customize the curriculum of government schools located in small towns/villages. Students should get exposure to knowledge and skills needed to work in the industries located near that town. E.G.In area where cotton is main crop, customize the syllabus to include lessons about cotton industry. Benefits: 1-Less migration to cities since people will have skills to find work near their town 2-Parents will encourage kids to go to school so that they learn the skills that provides employment nearby
1 0 Sir, Linking with voter IDs by established secured network offices by Government and providing at least one person with a job assurance to a family will be a good scheme I hope. But providing one person a confirmed job in a family all over the families of our country, through Government providing jobs is not possible to everyone. So, on behalf this the private employers establishments taken by Government through some part of recognition (like a bank recognized by Government) and considering.....
0 0 Respected Sir, the situation of government schools mainly situated at rural areas are very poor (in the term of education) students are just going to school for mid day meal and vajiphas (money) and they even don't know to write their names. Teachers are also not taking interest and only 2-3 Teachers are looking after the whole school. I have been to a primary school in UP and seen this. Govt. should take some initiatives to take care for this so that literacy rate can also increase in UP&Bihar
1 0 Respected Sir, I have a question for all Universities of India that when they are taking test for admission then ,what is value of percentage there? i am asking this because many universities have many checking ideas ,some universities have step marking plan and many type of these things.Sir because of this many students who are able to do many things in their field , they cant do, so please sir do some thing for indian education system.

Create a mix of eLearning, Live Virtual training & Class Room training programs, 5. Create curriculum for the courses and tag faculty - faculty can be experts from industry or from the leading institut 6. Launch the courses 7. Issue certification 8. Completion to Job application link
2 0 1)Every job provided by any organization in any field should be posted here. 2)It should focus on overall psychological growth of young students.3)This should be the gateway for different initiatives taken by the government which invites students from different fields to contribute for any venture.4)Research is lagging in India this centre should stress on it.5)In schools things like music,painting,dance,sports,cooking should be added by this centre so that students can discover their passion.
4 0 #CareerCenter 1. Knowledge required for Job examination need to be developed from an early stage. A reasoning subject can be included in school. 2. Training for careers should be made available online. So that anyone can access it anytime. 3. Donation for admission in school and college need to removed. So the poor talented students can get admission. 4. Government can create an website and make available all the open jobs. So every job information will be in one place and anyone can access it.
0 0 *This can be directly linked with ITI / Diploma / Universities / Graduation / Master collages *in first phase to speed up the things we can tie-up with linked in*local MLAs can be involved into this activity who can arrange job camp and data collaction along with NGOs
0 0 If we are here for sharing our Ideas, then I am thinking about Compulsory Army Training in Education system. It should start from 5th standard. By implement this our children will be healthy & more Disciplined in their life. Also they will have much more honor about our Country. It will help our Govt. to provide more jobs and funds to our officers after retirement from their Job of Army.
0 0 In outer rural area in India there is no library but we have cellular connection. What if whole public library books will available with their regular charges. I believe it will be very help full for student. I studied in a Hindi medium gov schooll although our school has library but we never saw sun shine in there. There are numerous books are allotted by gov but we never hear about them which is shame.
2 0 1. Incentivize young professionals with experience in industry to share their experiences; targeted at filling the gap between academia and industry. Develop Mentor-Mentee model. 2. Have testing/profiling system to help the job seekers understand their strength, weaknesses along with career roadmap. 3. Extend the reach of Career Centers beyond cities through Internet/Portal. 4. Use schools in villages and small towns as extended career Centers. 5. Use coursera.org model - skill developmet
1 0 Sir, We are informed to give our proposal for career centres. Sir, firstly we have to modified our education policies. Sir, the present standard of govt, school & collages is well-known to every one. Sir, due to our emphasis on private institutions the standard of Govt, School/collages is going down. Party&politics has ruined a lot. every body except poor now days moving to private institution. Sir, we have to stop it. Kindly bring amendments to the constitution for the same.
0 0 This portal should give opportunity to industries to give skill training to job seekers. Without skills, no point in the meeting of job seekers and job providers. Industries should periodically give hands on training for interested job seekers. So this portal should connect SKILL seekers and SKILL providers as well to make this move more meaningful
0 0 Honorable Respected Sir, I humble pray your honor that my representation for poor meritorious candidates, Kindly wave out all fees for comparative examination. Sir kindly ignore any mistake in this application.
1 0 This portal should also show where a particular skill can be achieved. Show details of employers who are willing to provide industrial training. Most educated population in India are unskilled. So we have to have JOB Seekers, JOB providers, and SKILL providers too in this portal. Industries in India should give free training to job seekers, then only the loop completes. Job seekers should understand what jobs are there and get trained in those skill areas. Industries should offer free training
1 0 Also we can utilize existing networks of post offices, psu banks, fire stations, police stations, railway offices, army offices, etc. to provide career counseling services using a well defined framework with clearly outline outcomes. Such services should be measured through good processes so that people do not scam these positions
0 0 We don't need separate career centers. We need curriculum change to include works like http://www.jaindia.org/programs/world-of-work and http://www.jaindia.org/programs/ja-careers-with-a-purpose. And we need career officers in every public office, who will assist anyone who wants to work there, to start a career there.
0 0 Read DGE&T's concept note on Career Centres. My thoughts: first of all please spread awareness about the concept and location of career centres. I have always heard of an employment exchange, never knew where one was. In addition, career centres across the country could compile their data annually to check overall quality and also excess / deficient supply of certain skills (avoid "bhedchal"). Also suggest focus on senior citizens. Many elders have skill, experience, will, and need money.

0 0 I think every school must follow a syllabus included employability skill. Every lesson in NCERT book has a value and skill to learn. so train teachers how to merge the skills in syllabus. Every school should have a science park, maths park, social science park for experiencing what the children learn. Exploit the ICT in school to the maximum, because we are teaching everything but not allowing the students to raise what they want to know.

0 0 Respected Sir, I have seen that Govt. Project to education child does not reach to right student and if student reach to them most of institute do not provide right education. they full fill govt paper work and collect money form govt. its not right we should do some for this to get value of money and make student more prefect.
0 0 1.Special focus should be on young people of rural areas who left their studies early for some reason. If they are doing farming they should be sent for a short duration of agricultural course which will help them to learn modern techniques. 2.Career centres should be in every panchayat level whereas skill centres could be in some districts only. 3.A webportal like just dial should be launched to register all local service providers and give them identity and verification(will check crime als
0 0 Government should maitain some rule to select private best school in every region of rural area and analyse their performance,if they have better performance than nearest any government school then government should take some action for private best school in rural area, give some amount for development of infrastructure and to encourage the teachers also. only because  of teacher that school's performence is good or bad depands..

0 0 All career centers should act as recruiters. They should conduct tests and there results should be posted. In their respective subjects. This will give a good basis to place candidates. My experience has been, that the students do not know any subject. I have been conducting interviews for a while now and know that non of them have any acquired skill sets. We need to start from the beginning. One such interviewee, could not read a para in English and tell its meaning, a second class level skill
2 0 We need to focus on educating and empowering the youth from rural India in solar energy and wind energy and integrate these small units with the grids. This will not only create job opportunities in the villages but also reduce overcrowding of cities like Mumbai. This will also help India as a nation to save resources like coal, petrol etc. Request the central govt. to provide subsidy to the educated youth in rural areas under this scheme.

We only need a good education reform policy. According to me position of education in India is same as position of government hospitals. You all know what I mean. There is need to work towards basic structure of education. If we develop skill in early age like China then I am sure that one day status will change.

0 0 Hi, My idea is cloud computing mobile application. Infrastructure as service provides a solution of IT infrastructure in low cost. In iaas different models (public, private, Hybrid) and different Layers(SAAS, IAAS, PAAS) is advanced technology. Using IAAS to create, deliver and manage multi-cloud services and implement cloud enabled business model.
0 0 This gigantic task cannot be done by Govt. alone. Evolve a PPP model and all business above a certain turnover(say 500 cr.) be involved through legal or incentive ( like tax sops etc.). ITI and Diploma level courses with strong Govt./third party monitoring and evaluation can revolutionize the skill power of this country. Agri-courses, manufacturing, IT, Para-medics are all field where organizations are facing man-power problem.

1 0 Tagline: "Your Path for SUCCESS" "JOIN.IMPROVE.SUCCEED" # Tax Benefits if private companies get candidates from NCS. # Alumni for NCS beneficiaries. This will provide an opportunity for the Beneficiaries to help others. # Seminars may be given frequently by inviting people from relevant fields. # Involving schools, Panchayats to be an Active Participants. # Online Knowledge base for Career Improvements Courses(like.. KHANAcademy) might help. Provide scholarships to students participation.
1 0 #CareerCentre - Start of Skill development should be initiated from Colleges itself rather than focusing on Theoretical knowledge which is not our youth any where after completion of 3/4 year degree from state/regional colleges. We have to induct in-house career centers where daily some practical skill training should be there with proper Teachers and Skilled Staff. Or we can divide this into 2 parts first part of College should be theory and other Practical Training, Live Projects etc
0 0 Though proper Career Centres are required to guide the youths to expertise their skills into the area of their interest. Govt. Emplyment Exchanges are of no use. It is good for the employees of the department only. We suggest to bring all Govt educational institute and Universities to bring under PPP Public Private Partnership for better education and transparency. Then there will be more development in Career pathways
0 0 Career Centres must be handed over in the hands of counselors and experts from the Industries.The unemployed persons & students must be guided in a proper way so that they plan their in a right way.Career centres must be equipped with all required in formations  so that ,a needy one may be well informed.
0 0 This system need to focus on find new enterpreneours who will create new job through innovating new thoughts and ideas.Government need to provide small interpreneour cheaper loans.
2 0 Today CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) only tackles corporates putting in money towards charitable institutions. However, apart from monetary capital, Corporates also have human capital. We can make it mandatory for each corporate worker to spend 1 hour each month (modest ask), counseling students in Career centres. This is just the minimum mandate. Further, there can be mentorship programs with varied levels of engagements (time based / project based etc) to suit corporate volunteers.

0 0 i think our education system must focus on educating students and finding them right path in there careers which we are failing at. the courses are tailor made what if student like maths and commerce equally and wanna make career in it. career outsourcing centers must focus on industry related training and must provide with job ready skills work on real projects
0 0 first of all our prime minister has been keen to start up issues regarding career centres for youth development and also skill oriented, the youth enpowerment and development should get registed asap so that can enable the youth's identity to be more secular and also scrutinies by the official who are in this team, the team should have 2 male and 2 females, one junior and one senior who can also make sure that skill development for youth development is going on and report should be submittedtopm
1 0 OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE OVER POPULATED WITH VARIOUS SUBJECTS. LIKEWISE, WE HAVE MANY IMPORTANT REALMS OF HUMAN LIFE & THOUGHTS WHICH ARE RELEVANT TO THE SOCIETY ARE IGNORED OR NOT INCLUDED AS A SUBJECT IN THE ACADEMIC. "INSURANCE SCIENCE"-IS ONE OF THEM.EVEN THOUGH "INSURANCE INDUSTRY" HAS GOT THEORETICAL DEPTH, MANY SUB-BRANCHES & PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS; BOTH INSIDE & OUTSIDE THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY/BUSINESS. "INSURANCE" IS A SUBJECT THAT HAS YET TO BE INCLUDED IN ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE.
1 0 I Think Every Student Should Get The Opportunities in His/Her Field By Giving Him Training
0 0 govt reforms in power sector reforms are not upto the mark.The power distribution boards are completely broke.power purchase agreement will not happen. Also gas supply bottlenecks are not being solved by govt. requesting the govt to carry out masssive reforms in power sector...maybe advice from suresh prabhu....plz give a massive thrust to this sector....
0 0 Lack of general awareness among people living in villages, tier 2 or tier 3 cities. People still unaware about the ample opportunities provided by globalized world and also there is no support system available. We should focus on career counseling and the skill development. Internet is a big enabler and every person can use the power of internet to reach any corner of the world. We can train our students to become entrepreneurs. It will help against drug addiction.
1 0 Create contact center which collaborate with all the ministry, all job seekar submit their application and get the update directly from contact center , open license test to private team, open education sector with skill enabled training outside govt control, create job opportunity for independent survey team for all govt initiative , more penetration on incometax net to trap outside tax net by infusing more work force,
1 0 1. A name that comes to my kind is "khoj"a perfect search for both job seeker and job giver. 2. Goverment can act like those private consultancies, develope website, allot agencies and the agaencies can earn the commision derived from the selected candidate from the company.
0 0 Waoooo being a women and staying out of job for time to nurse my baby, it sounds like a goodnews to restart. Ill hope this project will be soon implemented and we all would be benfited.

2 0 A Rozgaar TV channel can be started by GoI. Jobs starting from unorganized sector up to the MD of a government/ private organization can be put on this channel. A mobile app with notifications of Jobs can be designed. Employment News Paper should be made online. Rozgaar Kendra should be established at District levels. Rozgaar kendra should come under NITI Aayog.

Thank you
3 0 I would love propose a job channel for whole India as free channel similar as Doordarshan,locasabha and rajyasabha . . .this channel would the only source for proposing vacancies of all big companies in India. Which would reduce fraud application -most importantly all students over country would get their desired attention to unique and legitimate site. This will get their attention to their destiny as their qualifications and desire to reach their goal.
5 0 Employment exchanges should be professionalized. All the sites should  be upgraded. Most of the work should be made online. More online courses should be started.
1 0 some students couldn't grow in their career because of mainly financial problems and lack of awareness of programmes the govn taken.we hav very talented and experienced persons in all the department.After their retirement so many people are free in homes,with these persons we can improve free institutions to help the youth to grow in their career.if they wont wanted to go outside,they will give offline or online classes in their place.i think it will remove illiteracy by some percent.hope u like

1 0 1. We have a big network of HR professionals which can be tapped. - Commission/Stipend as remuneration 2. Many of the Govt Institutions, Schools remain unused on weekends. 3. Many Employers spend lakhs for PR on open positions. 4. Single Integrated Web App for all the stake holders including the youth. 5. Linked to NSR - National Skills Registry Right from School/College days/ This could be a Global Resume Reference for any Employer.
1 0 Work experience has become a major screening criteria for engineering and diploma holders. So, just like how the medical students are required to do house surgeon-ship before obtaining their degrees. The same has to be applied to engineering and diploma colleges. This will increase the quality of engineers going out.
0 0 Tool room in rural and urban areas by government to support local population with manual and power tools / machines for those who cannot purchase them can get on rent basis so that they can enhance there productivity and product quality. This is must both for rural and urban areas and government funded is required. This will also create jobs and tool / machine making companies can do on PPP basis so that machines / tools are sold and users can get them.
1 0 MyGov..........., There are some people who are having unused land beside main roads. These lands can be used for skill development centers (for welders, Electrician,Painters, Plumbers, etc) across India. This is especially important for states in the North East. Technical and funding support through BANK may be provided to people having minimum 1 acre  land beside highways and roads.
4 0 #CareerCentre: Nothing can help India, if people are still starved without Internet. Provide all skills tutorials in online for free to citizens. That is enough to fill the talents ready. People don't need free laptops or ipads, they just need basic high speed internet connectivity to learn things and compete with the world..but in India internet is extremely cost! while people around the word utilizing internet at the price of tv dish. Its clear where we are lacking.
3 0 Chemical R&D, nanotechnology, microchip manufacturing, Scrapping industry , solar panel manufacturing  - needs latest case studies on it, some high level blue prints with automation systems. basic people can evolve then after.
2 0 Database Architect - basic but real knowledge of Sql, A programming language , an ETL tool , OLTP tool . must required. Astronomy- Quantum physics , Relativity , Engineering degree must Clothing manufacturing , shoe manufacturing - latest fashion , low cost manufacturing strategy, prospecting market india or other developing country Synthetic hair wig has great demand abroad for indian hair
2 0 For me most important is Astronomy . There are many facts of universe and multi-universe which our people should have knowledge. Another skill set is on Quantum Physics.Then business perspective  Database Architect. Then clothing manufacturing blue prints , chemical research and development , shoes manufacturing,synthetic hair wigs, nanotechnology , microchip manufacturing, Scrape management(China is @ top) , Solar Energy experts and solar panel manufacturing push
0 0 A Government institute to set up some science fair in cities and encouraging research activities . And set up e-library with extraordinary knowledge. Provide knowledge from USA ,UK like countries on Skill india related knowledge stream. Open institute at very small level but it can work in different states simultaneously and create awareness on skill set and also provide e-library for related knowledge. And often encourage research activities , Case studies participation etc.
1 0 Hello PM, Good involvement of common man in building our India. Employment is right of every educated youth in our nation right it should be transparent in USA if unemployed person is their he contact to employment exchange where his/her name is registered. Officer check if he/she is unemployed they give them 5 weeks wages approx. and when he/she get employed they contact and govt stop that wages.it should follow in our India. Make every college, university registered student name 18+
0 0 #CareerCentre, #MinistryofLabourandEmployment, #NationalCareerService, #NSC, #NationalCareerServiceProject, #MyGov The value of the landscape architecture services is worth 2.3 billion per annum in the USA. In India the profession is 35 years old but is not recognised by the GoI. In terms of career opportunities it designs and manages the outdoor environment where impact of human activity is present. Immense employability in infrastructure and industrial corridors to restore ecosystems.

0 0 Demand supply will meet each other.those requiring specific talents, skill sefs shall locate such skilled persons and vice versa. The dynamics shall balance and match. Yhe process requires no intetvention from govt, but for public sector,s requirement. For meeting requirements of public sectors, they have established mechanism and requires least intervention either. Govt may comcentrate on better thimgs that it needs to do.
0 0 Sir, if u r talking abt emloyment exchange type centres, I donot think they r needed in the present scenario. Only unorganised sector need this information , bcs less educated oeople donot know where the vacancy exists for labourer or unskilled person. Radio can helo a lot in this direction. Local fm channel can earn revenue n workers can get job also.
0 0 Sanman,money and atm santushti should be key for developing careers and job profiles.self satisfaction is the only way to erase tension and anxiety.
0 0 there should be a relationship between educational institutions and the employment institutions related to these. for example around 1000 colleges are there in up for technical courses like b.pharm. b.tech. but industries related to them are about nil as compared to them. this huge differences must be negotiated..#mygov
1 0 Career education should not focus only on a career which earns money but one which earns respect. Moral values should be a part of proffessional education courses.
1 0 going by typical government system route will yield another 'employment exchange' system. it should enable: choosing right career & education field using scientific tools regular mentoring to students make material available related to career 'finishing school' system to prepare and make job ready involving NGO's and local community can make it successful. we have edugram for all these at small level - edugram.org and facebook.com/edugram.org
1 0 These career centres should be related to universities as an interface to decide syllabus, skills taught  in universities according to the requirement in market.
2 0 Contd. From Previous Post. We have to ensure that the numbers of this country are turned into assets in the service of their Nation, in particular, and the humanity in general. Besides this broadest goal, the quick and immediate motivation has to be to encourage them to become self-reliant beaming with self-confidence instead of remalning at the thresh-hold of frustration. THE GOVERNMENT HAS A GUIDING ROLE TO SAVE THE YOUTH FROM STUMBLING IN RECOGNISING THEIR ROLE AND FALLING PREY TO FRUSTRATION
1 0 Proposed career centres should be linked or attached with universities, they should like an interface in between universities and market.
0 0 It has to be taken care of that the proposed Career Centres should be  within easy approach of the targetted lot so that none feels the pinch on any count and become hasitant. Rather, it would be more appropriate if the youth are motivated to try to feel the pulse of the field of interest they feel motivated towards while pursuing school studies itself. THE HASITANT ONES NEED TO BE HELPED TO SEE WITHIN THEMSELVES TO LOOK FOR THE AREA OR FIELD THAT WOULD SUIT THEM THE MOST. NO EXCLUSIONS PLEASE.

0 0 As I apprehended in my post on 5th March, new formart of MyGov has not yet become free from hassels for all contributors as yet. Needless to underline, participation to MyGov is not iimited  to high-tech-savvies only. Rather, even mediocre ones would like to try their  hands on visiting and partcipating by contributing in their own humble way on  topics they are comfotable with. IT IS DESIRABLE THAT MyGov MAY FORMATTED IN A MODE TO BE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL AND SUNDRY HASSLE FREE.
0 0 We have many bright students but they lack confidence and focus. For the past 15 yrs I carried out number of activities like development workshops. Another imp thing is to motivate students to do something great in their life. If students are polished, they shine. I purposely hired vernacular medium students, interviewed them in Hindi if they could not speak English. Within 3 months, they were at par with others. My successful activities are listed in PDF File.
1 0 A website should be made which will include all exam info(eligibility,edu,syllabus,etc) written in simple language Maximaun use of e-services. councillors avail in correspnding languages. motivation n guidance should be provided. all teachers of school and college can be joined for help. online counseling guidance.
0 0 attach every engg collage,politech,iti to industry than only than only our youth get skilled.no instute opened without attachment
0 0 Creation of "Career Centres" is a great idea. There is no doubt about it. The most important thing is that how these can be sustainable and keep providing quality results to the users. In my opinion, Public-Private-Partnership is a great model to start with. Anyone who needs to get tips or detailed training in preparation of his/her Job Resume can walk in and get necessary help. Let us discuss in more details through discussions on this platform.I would like to share my experience.
0 0 "career center" idea seems to your coordination with earlier programmes named " Reorienting Employment Exchanges" & "Digital Locker". But most important is to coordinate between INDUSTRY & our HRD MINISTRY COURSE DESIGN. Further you might be interested in under mentioned CII report on requirement of INDIAN INDUSTRY: 1. Make In India: Turning Vision Into Reality - Report Released at the 13th Manufacturing Summit 2014 2. Industry 4.0 - Next Gen Mfg Plz design your plan considering above.
0 0 #CareerCentre - Though rural areas are in dire need of such centres, attention should be given to the effectiveness and ease of operation of such centers.  I would say it is good to start with district head quarters and taluk head quarters. In all government programs initial success is very important, in people considering the program a success or not. Initial success will create the necessary momentum to inspire more people to get involved.
0 0 #careercentre should be established in rural zone for, encouraging youth,take a initiative to promote education in every rural society, such type of centre must have consulting forum
0 0 a. Branding of Career Centres: YoungIndia (Aap ka kal, Aap ke sath hai) b. Coverage of Career Centre: Public Sector per state per district per city c. Implementation Agency for Career Centres: Industry Association - Invest in India d. Services to be offered: Counselling, Skill Training, Internship, Job portal e. Technology Platform for NCS: Good. f. Network of Career Counsellors: From industry and academies. h. Local Service Providers through Career Centres: No only through emp office.
1 0 The Country will be reach when its per capita energy conservation will increase.. For that we need to setup small scale industries and source of energy/power. there are several sources of  getting Energy from non-conventional sources, govt should come forward with helping hand for those who want to do something for their country.. Solar, and Solid Waste  are the simplest method that can be implemented.. So Mr Modi should think of it
0 0 Career centres at Block level and then Panchayat level should be encouraged under PPP model.
3 0 I thought of a plan for generating electricity from solid waste in each city or community. This system should act like a retail mall in a city . Different companies will setup their plant in city for using solid wastes for producing amenities like electricity, gas etc.. It will depend on customer to buy cheapest electricity from government or private company.
2 0 We should outsource some of the basic research for public policy to schools and state level engineering colleges. It will be radical change in research culture and we shall have ideas and data from basic ground level.
0 0 #MyGov: The first thing what we have to change is the way of designing our syllabus. Through our schools we provide such knowledge which is of no better quality. In terms of CBSE the education is good but when the matter comes to the state's syllabus it creates the differences. Firstly hike the quality of state pattern.

2 0 There should be a national portal for all Private and Public company Jobs. Now a days many students who are doing professional courses take loan and when they do not get good placements they get demotivated. The image of the person diminishes in society as well as home. Everything should be on Merit basis and there should be no favouritism as well as no quota. The process should be very transparent that even a person is not selected for a particular he/she should be given a correct feedback
1 0 Job For all.... that can be our mantra. Agriculture and related industries are our main area of thirst infrastructure development and automobile, Electronics are also big employer Tourism and Travel sector can also play a crucial role making India can produce lakhs of job Need to analyse global market for products  and need job polling according to that and support allied industries Micro industries and food processing etc all these need good skill development programmes
3 0 It should be made mandatory for all employers to give their career openings in the National Career Service Portal so all job seekers can refer only one website for job opportunity.
3 0 sir, careers centres needs to be connected with across the nation. National career centre must establish across the nation. pls also consider for non technical and technical career centres which will avoid the queues and needs to encourage the productivity
0 0 Amma Please Review  Amma Vasu Ramagovinda
1 0 Career centres can be managed ideally by the local academia and local industrial bodies. Academics engaged in career centres should interact with industry and then use pedagogy to suitably structure courses. E-Learning should be encouraged for theory and practical training should be conducted at the shop floors of locally available enterprises.
0 0 Growth in manufacturing & production will also help in increase in job requirement for under skilled workers.
0 0 There should be focus on primary school education as well....
0 0 Their should be periodic guidance career guidance and skill development for every child from early school levels. Practical class need to incorporated from 6th Std. More and more Creative awareness be created at village levels,incorporated with co-curricular activities for villagers/Parents. Make them understand the benefits of each activity. This will help parents to orient their wards with alternative futuristic goals and careers.
0 0 for more employment i suggest for the IT hub to be developed in Lucknow and Agra.
1 0 Encourage agro forestry and tree plantation as career in villages. this will generate employment and save the climate.
0 0 it is very necessary to all the student for career centre at panchayet level and block level. this ideas is very can be very useful, because many poor student can not live the town they want to complete the our study in own villege. so career centre not impleted on the district level and state level they should be a panchayet and block level. and after the completion of academic qualification they provide the skill devlope. after that they start the self employment.
2 0 it my thought for career centres
0 0 Contd...Hence, there is need that MyGov. should continue to work in such a way that all those who have been participating thus far, and contributing to its contents from their devices with modest facilities, are not 'left-out', or, feel excluded. WITH THE INITIATIVE OF THE HON'BLE PRIME MINISTER, SHRI NARENDRA MODI, MYyGov. HAS COME AS A HANDY TOOL BECOMING AVAILABLE WITH EVERY CITIZEN TO FEEL CLOSE TO THE CORRIDORS OF GOVERNANCE, WHERE HE FEELS HIS WORDS WOULD REACH WHERE HE CAN'T.
0 0 All the traditional cottage industry in the country facing problem due to negligence of govt. Govt taking hardly concrite steep to modernised this industries with new technology with good governess. So please make survey this sector do necessary and introduce technology and training where it needs.my nation is covered with such industry and much of our people depending on this industries.
0 0 WEICOME! NEW FOTMAT, A NEW 'AVTAR' OF 'MyGov.' It is really more fascitating and more interesting to work on it. But several like me must be yet struggling to come to terms with  its complete fool-proof functioning. This must especially be so with those contributors to the contents of MyGov  who are using a 'Tablet' as device. WITH TECHNOLOGY TAKING QUICK TURNS AT EVERY TURN OF MOMENT, THE 'DEVICES', ESPECIALLY 'TABLET' GET OBSOLETE, GETTING INCOMPETEBLE TO TECHNOLOGY SITES WORK ON.
0 0 There is every need that a wide-reaching campaign be launched in every nook and corner, and far-flung areas of the country to make aware the targetted budding beneficiaries of the proposed Career Centres, the availability of facilities for them to get themselves well-equipped in areas/fields they see themselves well suited for. "CATCH THEM YOUNG." SHOULD BE THE 'GUIDING-LINE HERE ALSO. IT IS FAR EASY FOR A YOUNG MIND TO ADAPT ITSELF TO A PARTICULAR  MOULD AND MODEL WHEN IT IS YET TO BE MOULDED.

1 0 With the decline of skilled labours accross the country, there is a need to create new centres to train people and to fund them, to establish themself as entrepreners. This move would bring growth to small scale industries/businesses, which bharat needs at this moment.Apart from bank lending loans,there should be few seed funding groups created by govt-which would help & mentor talents.A chairman as head supported by 3/4 eminent personalities from various fields such as law,art,science&Tech.

0 0 Career Centers for each locality to have facility to register volunteer for teaching - Retired Professors, IT professions wanting to teach, Retired Teachers, Researchers etc
0 0 Sir, We need to have a national skill development portal similar to coursera. All schools going children should have career counselling centers. We should make vocational training is mandatory and should allow students to take up their area of interest. Tax benefits should be given to organisation which support in skill development. National Skill register to be rolled out and companies should be made to hire from the registered pool of candidates.
0 0 portal where we can consult about socio-economic things ..
0 0 Every block of 300 students should be tied to a Career Centres and 5 Career Centre need to be tied to a regional career centre. Career centers should be associated with regional industrial areas. Each student from age of 14 and above need to do a vocational training of 1 month every year with the industry in that region. Each career centre should be connected to each other via internet. Concentration should be in field of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics with practical knowledge.
0 0 give tax relief for all private businesses to give paid internship positions to newly passed graduates and school leavers youth. immediately it will open millions of positions for skill development in the country and lots of new employments for these interns. Govt can also fund scholarships to fund these new student interns for limited period after which businesses can absorb the promising people!

0 0 Case based competitions where groups of individuals are first tutored on Consulting type best practices, then do a competition under supervision. Teams are  judged on their abilities and logical processes used to analyze and solve problems. Teams that are in above the 80 percentile are moved to more rounds. Round 1 can be done in a 4 hour block (1 hour tutorial & 3 hour competition). Additional rounds can be designed on a need basis depending on type of problem being presented.
0 0 I suggest for the career centres in every Block office, managed in supervision of Block Development officers. I also suggest for the career counsellors available at that centres to guide the students for better courses and employment.
0 0 Recruitment of skilled teachers or giving them a proper training is the need, I hope NCS is having having in to reach the schools and pathsalas in villages where standard of education is going down because of unavailability of skilled teachers. All the Best!!!!!
0 0 The career center has to be brought up from the Schools and it should go through out the Colleges and Universities up to the level where the young people can get what they expected or I say What they Dreamt .
0 0 Green India is possible if educated unemployed are trained raising seedling for medicinal and economically useful plant species at nursery. This would green the locality, generate profit to the entrepreneur and turn idle manpower productive. Social Forestry can do this task. Let this be the state policy. Green, Clean and Sheen India soon may become reality.
1 0 getting support from MGNREGA & NREGA will definitely help.....
1 0 We can also promote NCS by involving BDO's & VDO's of all the block and villages. this will also help in increase the reach of NCS at all the levels. we can also have some level of support and collaboration with projects like MGNREGA & NREGA.
2 0 1) Career centres must have full-time counselors to assess and guide individuals for prospective career and skill development in which they find livelihood and excel. 2) Mentor-men-tee program (Volunteer) in which a skilled person may volunteer to teach to others. Career centres can facilitate such relationship 3) Create labs/tie up with industry for practicing the new skills and get certified 4) Partner with universities/education institutions in both urban and rural for accessibility
1 0 For Career Centres there should be atleast one career centre in each village. Where any School Principal or Teacher or School Premises may used for the centre. Career center wil provide the information of all professional, scholarships, education loan, government schemes, Competitive exams . There should be one workshop on every sunday for all the student and attendance of each student must be compulsary for the same. In each workshop Professional may come from nearby areas n discuss experience
0 0 Growth in manufacturing & production will also help in increase in job requirement for under skilled workers.
1 0 Govt. should help manufacturing sector to improve the job market... Make in India is a good step, increase in export will definitely help in increase of export, which means increase in production. this will definitely help in improve job market. hope to see growth in manufacturing sector.
0 0 dear modij plz take action according to this ideas.or else there is no way our life will get better..the govt will lose elections....after delhi... plz revive infra sector....power sector.revive stalled projects.....
0 0 REVIVE STALLED PROJECTS Govt has not revived any of stalled projects...Plz revive stalled projects..WHERE ARE THE GREENFIELD PROJECTS????
0 0 The govt is pro corporate Bah! No GREENFIELD PROJECTS has come after 9 months of govt... No projects have come in power,water etc.... Revive the power sector....Projects have been declared only on paper.But no actual MOVEMENT ON GROUND....
0 0 In continuation.... So they are selling potatoes for damn cheap or you can say farmers are making losses, why we dont emphasize in processed foods, so that over produced farming products can be processed and added value, does govt. have any plans for giving concession to this processing food sector to nudge enterprise to enter this sector to make some huge money, nothing could be sustainable in the long run if monetary benefits are not attached to the things people do. Pvt enterprise can solve.
0 0 plz revive gas supply bottlenecks.....
0 0 Dear Modi Plz solve the land acquisition law with best interest of INDUSTRY... BRING BRING INT RATE DOWN DRASTICALLY.CONTROL INFLAATION. new projects are not being declared.....old projects are struck. revive ppp models ..else the govt is dud.. order inflow is weak...capital goods are struggling...infra is struggling.power sector is weak.....plz revive the sector...
0 0 what is the purpose of these career centers? will they provide jobs in the pvt. sector or in the psu. or govt. employment. Private sector knows how to hire and i dont think they will take advice from the govt. while hiring. Impetus should be in the farming entrepreneurship, to make our farmers more productive and market their products in the market.
