0 0 Please scrap all Central Government Taxes like Excise Duty, Corporate Tax, Income Tax and Service Tax to pave way for digitized India!The Central Government can implement a Banking Transaction Tax to replace these taxes, which can be implemented through the banking system and credited to the government account immediately. The elimination of humans from tax collection will surely reduce corruption. Withdrawal of 2000 & 500 notes from system will also boost banking transactions & govt revenue
0 0 The RBI statistics reveals that we, the people of India have been transacting between Rs. 75 Lakh Crores to Rs. 95 Lakh Crores per month through our banks, excluding Bank to Bank transactions & Government transactions. If we can implement a transaction tax of 2%, the central government can get a revenue of 1.5 lakh to 2 lakh crores every month. Through this method, the government can hope to get a total revenue between Rs. 18 Lakh Crores to Rs. 24 Lakh crores! This will surely reduce corruption
0 0 The plant Presopis Juliflora is occupying thousands of acres of wasteland throughout Tamilnadu. Even though the High Court has ordered uprooting and destruction of this monstrous and thorny weed, very little has been achieved. Please note that economics also plays a major part in obstructing the growth of this plant. We, the farmers get Rs. 2350 per tonne of Sugarcane, but the weed can fetch anywhere around Rupees 4000 per tonne. Please ban this monstrous weed, just like Ganja or Abin plant.

Today, most of the Youths between the Age group of 25 to 45 years are relocating to Metros is because of the high paid Jobs in Malls, Restaurants and Transportation. Why not attract those Youths from Metros back to Villages by creating a Revolution in Agricultural fields that yield more profit to upgrade and advance their lives....

No one believe's our CM,. We believed you. But by your response i was really sad. I have great expectations from you Modiji. Please be for us

1 0 HONOURABLE PM OF INDIA, My name is tushar and I like to make 2 suggestions: 1) we should take a pledge to setup a POLLUTION TASK FORCE in India which has not still been encorporated in our country. This pollution force should be formed in order to look only after the pollution causing elements and an adequate action can be taken against those who found guilty. 2) we should not allow industries to throw water directly into river . This waste should be taken care of and must be treatedbefore
0 0 Honorable PM Sir... Please pay attention towards the BAJAR SAMITI of farmers in Maharashtra..Due to Demonitization and excess production this year prices fell down drastically by merchants which destroyed farmers day to day life.Provide profitable price to farmers otherwise their trust on U may goes down.
1 0 Please abolish caste base reservation. After 70 years of independence it's a shame if people still need reservation. If needed, make it based on economical condition of people.
0 0 Please ban making and selling of fire crackers in whole country. I am sure there are more innovative and eco friendly ways to celebrate. This will also help in curbing pollution.
1 0 AARAKSHAN should not be given at country level, becase you will see different cities where one population is higher then other one and at same time , the higher population is lower in another city or state. so make it city basis or state basis not at country level.
1 0 3- you were talking for transparency in political party on fund. why not it is being implemented. get every payment online only. no cash. 4- Make current account transaction online only , no cash transactino should be allowed to make india cashless, these business should come online completely. 5- i think the worker on BJP are not working at ground level and that s why you will not be getting benefit even after been a very popular leader.
1 0 sir, i think following must be considered now. 1- please do some thing to get voter card online. making it online will give a real benefit to learned people and they will be able to vote. most of the people dont want to vote to because of they dont have voter card or link it with aadhar card. so who ever have aadhar should be able to vote.this is problem i am facing now and not able to vote. 2- Arakshan to minorities and give it to real required people, based on state or city count level.
1 0 respected PM sir.The best way to celebrate republic day is to make resolution to make our country poverty free.Each and every person in country should have shelter , suficient food for eating and means of livelihood so that we can achieve means of republic day.We are proud to be Indians and salute efforts of army and government towards development of country.We will achieve the goals and make country's future bright.

0 0 Central Government has cancelled number of NGO who are not doing their intended purpose and not submitting their audit reports for so many years. Likewise it can cancel PETA also which is creating problems for Indian Economy by reducing A2 milk production in India since PETA registered in India. Why central government has not taken action against Karnataka for not fulfilling Supreme Court order on Cauvery waters whereas central government is insisting for Supreme Court order on Jallikattu.

So request our PM Mr. Narendra modi take intiative to create the environment of innovation in india. Arrange the seminar of professor on national channels to inspire the youth of india for invvotion. And also encourage the private mass media to do so..
0 0 This Republic Day the Government should make it a point that the kissans of our country should be encouraged to start  growing food on cooperative basis.I am sure that they will be successful like Amul Dairy in Gujarati. Another point to be noted is that as there is a shortage of new Rs 500/- and Rs 1000/- currency note in the country, these along with Rs50/- Rs 20/- and Rs 10 and Rs 5/- must be printed in another country on priority basis and should be distributed in our country  quickly.

0 0 sir, plz find the pdf file attached hereto.
1 0 Republic Day event is moment of  Great pride!!. Proud moment to see our armed forces displaying their might, parade by different units of armed forces arouses feeling of pride & honor for our country in our hearts. Display of cultural tableau  is a memorable experience.
0 0 On this republic day we must take oath to give education to everyone and every child must get play ground for playing.Poor who is still far away many scheme which is made for them,and every child full freedom from economy barrier.
0 0 This Republic Day let us make our nation Corruption free Pollution free Clean India move towards Green India,Developed India
0 0 A Tribute to ISRO on Republic Day Celebration
0 0 Let’s celebrate Republic Day this year with the motto of "Clean India, Developed India".
0 0 Vivekananda elaborates – “Why was it so easy for the English to conquer India? It was because they are a nation, we are not. When one of our great men dies, we must sit for centuries to have another…” in contrast with other nations that had a greater number of educated men and women.(2/2)
0 0 Need to create great leaders in India:"While in America, Vivekananda had noticed that there was barely a difference between the higher classes of India and America, but there was an “infinite” distance between the poor of the two countries. This impoverishment in India in terms of education and empowerment of the masses was responsible for a “dearth of great ones".(1/2)
0 0 And my suggested tagline for this cell is... Kuch likh aisa,shadiyo tak yaad rahe vaisa. I hope u consider my suggestion and do something on this topic.
0 0 To write something is an art but mostly ignore this and the reason is there is no gov.cell which motivates the common people to write something who have this art.No adds no promotions in India for that.Especially poor people can't afford the book publishing process which is so costly.So I request u on this republic day announce a cell which help the common people at district level.
2 0 Honourable PM sir...I want that u announce a initiative of gov.for writing books on this republic day.Everyone knows the deep effect of stories,poems one our mind nd heart.Even u also read the autob.of Benjamin franklin.One line can change the whole life of a person.Everyone wants to become a eng.,teacher,doctor but rarely someone wants to become a writer due to lack of parents support and difficult process of book publishing.
0 0 BHARAT MATA KI JAI I Salute our Nation & great respect to the Gov for being Indian.JAI HIND
0 0 Please look after poor section of the society. SAVE THE HUMANITY.
0 0 For the service rendered by cpmfs,please include the marching contingents of bsf,crpf,itbp etc.it will demoralise these forces beyond repair if its not repaired.
0 0 Republic day Parade is more Delhi centric.Why not Republic day parade venue not be shifted to state capitals from next year ?
1 0 Individual vehicles are allotted to each government officers for conducting tours even though their service is not important in nature.  Instead a pool can be formed at district level which would provide the vehicles accommodating more than one officer in the tours to same route in the same time schedule. This will restrict misuse of vehicle and save fuel too.
0 0 Ya!!! our government was moving under a exrtraordinary leader its awesome actually. we do need to celebrate our republic day as much grand... please every citizen much be so patritotic. those who buy our indian flag on the day they give pose as much as possible  but the every next day its in dust bin please my request is dont do that nonsence. its hurting... please remember my words
0 0 Various people with me also not known the actual fact regarding republic day (26jan), out knowledge in this festival is incomplete, the education system, our media and other sources not educate to citizen regarding this (26jan) festival. kindly get a operation to educate the world to the important(s) of this day.
0 0 This moment is very important. i have from Odisha, in past when i had to Delhi to enjoy 26Jan, the defense authority not allowed me. I am Indian but autority dyned me to join and enjoy this festival in past. it's hot to my ego and i had been returned. Please try avoid this types of attitude to citizens.
0 0 I have been genuinely working in the environmental sector for sustainable development in terms of environmental research, through our NHO "Centre for Environment". i am sharing a link of my deeds through our web site; www.cepter.org
0 0 I am a proud Indian & I have designed a youth song along with my collegue, for the inspiration which is attached herewith. Thank you, Prof. mr. Shekhar Salunke
0 0 PM Modi Sir – Attached a file herewith stating detailed suggestions which includes following titles (With details) for combating corruption: 1)	Closing Ration Shops & Transferring Monthly Fixed Amount 2)	Removing Bank Managers – substituting Technology 3)	Eradicating Bribes in the Educational Institutions 4)	Nationwide Audit on all Real Estate Companies 5)	Revenue department transactions through online 6)	Reorganizing vital departments
0 0 Govt Officers should get promotion or other benefits based on only their performance. That will kill the corruption. That will improve the quality of govt services.
0 0 Sir why not the condition should be there for reservation category that no child of govt officer would get the benefit of reservation. India demands it sir, please, You are the hope.
0 0 Sir, why so much facilities to MLA's & MP's. They are there to serve the nation, not themselves. India needs a big change in such provisions made by earlier govt. That is total waste of govt fund.
0 0 Things have changed, not much for poor, 70 years a long time.Rich people have become richer, poor poorer,not always but mostly.We have to pause and re-think are we a welfare state, why there is so much disparity between poor and rich.Since 2015,there are hopes of development with the present government focussing on innovation like demonetisation, more bold innovation has to come in Education,Health Care,urban development,transportation using technology to provide high quality low cost solutions
0 0 Promote khadi and Handlooms production,by making mandatory for Govt/psu/bank/cbse/University/railway/ Postal staff etc during office time to wear Khadi and Handloom clothes,also promote jute industry which would revive these industries and give jobs to many weavers.Train unemployed including rural people in solar panel installation and maintainence,clean drinking water,swatch bharath mission following www.barefootcollege.com model.Improve toilets in Trains &install toilets in all public places
0 0 Digidhan is great but enhance servers and platform to make whole system smooth
0 0 Respected Honorable PM sir, As So many know that Our armed forces need so many technical officers, I have a doubt regarding eligibility. Armed forces says that the minimum height required for women technical officers from north east India is 147 cm and other part of the country is 152 cm. When the training for both the candidates are same, why the government has not revised that the minimum height is 147 cm from any part of the country?
1 0 #indianRailways 1. Do not start any new train on busy route. Due to this existing train existing runs late. 2. Improve the quality. Now we are paying good amount for the journey, still we are not getting good features. 3. Station master rarely check what is going to sell on station premises. It must be their responsibility. Unauthorized guy sells in train 4. You started water ATM. I travel last month from Delhi to Bareilly, None of them was working. Please take care for maintenance also.
0 0 Every payment above Rs 4999/- should be in form of Cheque, Online payment or Credit/ Debit Card Payment only. Why there should be cause for corruption ?
1 0 First of all congrats to finish your target for the black money corruption project!!! Awesome Mr. PM, Now, you should think about the lower & middle class people as how they can grow up more wisely and efficiently in this market!!! Think about a small trader/professional/self employed/business man!!! How they can stand in this slag market??? Actually there is no purchase or sell in this current market scenario!!! Please think about the small business man!!! Happy republic day!!! Jai hind
0 0 Honorable Prime Minister sir, First of all thank you so much for the action against blackmoney, its really very helpful for the Middle class and lower middle class people, to respect your action and to help government i am started paying all my purchase and bill using my state bank of india debit card, but when ever i am filling petrol for my bike SBI debiting 2.5% of surcharge and debiting the same from bank account. Kindly take necessary action to stop this surcharges -Faithfully Rameshkumar
0 0 Modi about the corruption matter with proof I am loged the complaints in MN App only received and forward that  complaint except that nothing will be happen nobody has shown any interest about the corruption matter with valid proof I am  complaining against the LIC but  Prime Minister Office has not serious about the corruption matter that for i am sending all details to you with open complain letter after that every responsibility is POM office.  Thanks Regards
0 0 Respected Modi ji, thanks for the taking action against for the corruption and black money. To day we all are feel proud that you have trying for eradication the corruption and black mony, sir I have also face lots of problems at the age of 76 only for the willfully corruption.  Sorry to saying that I have provided all proof about the corruption matter but except receive and forward nothing will be happen, there for I am sending all things with proof to you with a open comppaint letter. Regards
1 0 When would people get the benefits of that demonetization move, we are supporting to PM Modi, they have the believe that, yes modi can do something different and better, So they accept the pain of that cruel demonetization move. It is their right to get the real benefit of the demonetization.
0 0 just we have to marked our brands and industries all over the world I attached one youtube video link with this. Govt should promote and advertise our culture and industries all over the world by making documentaries and by other means.
1 0 I want to see better health insurance scheme by government being announced.
0 0 On every republic day, the government should set a goal for the next year or next few years and display the results achieved during the republic day parade and celebrate the success. Only one goal needs to be projected and invite all citizens to work for it. This will become a constructive habit among the citizens and many goals can be set thereafter.
1 0 It is very good initiative by government to promote digital payment and cashless transaction. My suggestion is all kind of transaction charges applicable during online money transfer, booking if flight, railway booking etc should be waived off. It should make free transaction. Then only people will start using cashless transaction.
0 0 India need to create leaders who will be like Statesmen cadre, with great patriots of the land, and do selfless service to the nation on par with the world standards protecting the sacredness, Vedic culture of the land. We may need about 10000 or more leaders now and in the future generations to make India a developed and powerful nation.
1 0 My suggestion would be to do something who are suffering from money lenders. There are few people who take money from illegle money lenders and they pay 4 to 5 times extra as an installment however they havent cleared there money yet. It would be greate you can give freedom to those poor people from moneylenders.
0 0 Everyone gave suggestions here including me, without reading description, for upcoming republic day. Please share same with PMO. Few things can b very important
0 0 Do explain, what gov could not achieved as planned and what's the plan for it in short. This balance and judgemental words will have real good impact on Indian. And we ppl will easily ignore oppositions disturbing reaction. Instead of you hosting flag, invite any great widow or father of soldier to do honour. Include it in speech. with your experience, if there is any good intelligent person opposition allow them to speak for 1 minute to express thanks to nation or any suggestion
0 0 Like the way you touched people heart chord by toilet mission, announce plan to engage beggars, trutiy panthi people into skill dev and job to uplift them from their current low status in socienty. Make them respectful citizen. This is a humanity cause. Please.
0 0 Declare a NS Day - National Service Day for people, student all to be direct part of national initiatives like digital learning and teaching, clean india, khaadi etc. One day to register and be part of event.
1 0 Hon. PM has great vision and concept of nation first, and people are also encouraged to involve and  participate in various schemes and programmes related to  development of nation and people voluntarily do  best work for our nation, Best wishes, thanks

Priti
0 0 Sir, I think there should be another big step to pass a bill removing all controls of politicians over police. It will definitely give a huge to our fight against corruption. Please let me how was my suggestion.
0 0 Muje lagta hai ki yadi India ko cashless banana hai to every tranjection par kuch na kuch Milna chiye logo to Tabi log attract hoge or online tranjection karge. Ye process tab tak chalni chaihiye jab tak kam se kam  90% log cash less payment karna start nahi karde. Qki abi logo ko lagta hai ki une Kya profite hoga online tranjection se Or jage jage digital board or koi Jo Ise processing ko btha shake Uske liye camp Lagana Bhut jaruri hai.
0 0 Start the new trend for young generation that is "learning and earning". Bcoz youth must be self dependand, It will help to increase more active persons in nation and the problem of laziness in youth will solve in next 10 years.  Thank you

0 0 Dear PM, for this republic day my humble request with you is merge both Independence day & Republic Day and celebrate only once, thus save the tax payers money.  Since independence we are tired of hearing the name of cast everywhere, please try your best to remove the caste column from the next academic year from all the school and college admissions, later on extend it to the employments.The caste based reservation system to be eliminated and facilities to be given only based on financial stat

0 1 My Suggestions for Budget 2017 PART 1
0 0 Republic is most important and effective for indian. my constitution active 26 january 1950 then we indian living a legal life and careful life. my constitution is very best in other books.....we learn constitution maker on republic day and i appeal to government and indian people all work done according to constitution.
0 0 Where's my Indian mat from Amazon for republic day? why would a western world leading country do that? Many newspapers reported Christians been attacked in India. The reporters also conveniently mentioned that India has 80% Hindus is the very next line. Media like this incites violence. Had I not been in India, and seen the compassionate people of India... I would have also believed what foreign media had thrown at me! The reason of spreading Misleading info was for NGOsponsorship BMKJ
0 0 We the people of Odisha really in pain with lots of issues not supporting the common mass ,only the agenda were released for vote banking,especially myself a private lecturer and teach last 20 years without salary,and the nasty word BLOCKGRANT for the lecturers is only in Odisha,by which we penalised and ruined our future as well as unable to maintain our family,so in coming republic day-2017 prime minister must reform the ugly issue and save the state as well as nation.its my hope on Modi Ji.
0 0 I appeal because for woman's safety because I want my country's women to be safe. They should not remain on the mercy of the helping hand, which most of the time not available at the time of incidence.
0 0 I hereby appeal to our honourable PM to please empower women by way of martial art training. Let these male chauvinist get to learn. Once the women start defencing themselves, the instances of molestation, rapes, etc are bound to decline. The trainers would also get respected employment for a short period or whatever govt decides. These trainers shall be hired by govt. Training centres shall be run by govt. Even in schools & colleges, the trainers fees be reimbursed by govt to the institutes.
0 0 The sorry state of woman safety is emerging every minute in every nook and corner of our country. I feel, with every other measure that would be taken, government should make mandatory (compulsory) for every Indian female to learn some kind of martial art. This would empower them to resist & fight back. This could be done by way of making compulsory periods in a week in schools & colleges. The home makers, middle age women should learn it through dedicated training centres of govt of India.

0 0 India is facing Emergent in Election Reformation Now it becomes an emergent to make sure a significant reformation in the Indian Election pattern. BY the time has passed, earmarking discrepancies has been started arising in the Election Cycle starting from Nomination, Campaign, Voting and then Ruling of the Party after deceleration of results. Its Alas, that our Political Parties has been conferred to so many liberation in terms of their core working and its accountability.
2 0 I request PM should avoid mocking of opposition leaders particularly Rahul Gandhi. It doesn't suits the stature of a PM of India. When he speaks, he represent Indian PM post in India and abroad. So people of India expect it's PM should be matured. PM can give befitting reply to he allegations or queries in logical manner but not in a mocking style. It does not gone well with common Indians.

0 0 They need to be provided with proper protective gears to deal with harsh weather conditions that they encounter in high altitude mountain regions and other tough terrains. They need to be provided with proper shelters, camps and bunkers that are built with high quality materials that provide necessary safety and protection. They should not be a soft target for enemies. We are proud of our armed forces and let us salute them for the sacrifices they make to keep the country safe and secure.
0 0 I think govt. Should announce these days like 26 January, 15 August as holy day instead of holiday specially for the students because most of the students have no idea about these days even I don't know the importance of these days perfectly. So I suggest that Govt. Should arrange a seminar or showing patriotic video every school such that students can get enthusias about patriot and love India from their core of heart.

0 0 It is a delight to watch the national flag been unfurled and be part of the singing of our national anthem. We must always remember the sacrifices made by our armed forces to defend our borders and their tireless effort to keep our country safe and secure enabling us to sleep peacefully and safely in the nights while they stay awake and vigilant to protect the citizens. Needless to say, they need to be properly equipped with high quality weapons and protective gears matching current need.
0 0 Let me begin by wishing my citizens a happy republic day. I have been watching republic day parade live telecast for more than two decades now. Every year, it has been unique display of our military powers of our armed forces. It is great to watch march past as well as fly past of our air force and other military equipment displays. It is a proud moment to watch parade of various units of army. The display of tanks and missiles is a great treat to watch. I am proud of our armed forces.
0 0 Firstly I will like to wish all our country people - "Happy Republic Day". We should learn from our Honorable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji for trying hard to keep India Corruption Free, trying to overcome all the obstacles.

0 0 India me people Prime Minister ke kehne se pehle e unki mann ki baat ko samjte hue kam krte hai, see attachment cash less awareness from 2015
0 0 Yes!I proudly feel that "We the People of India" have made an impact on the world today. However, a lot more powerful is yet to be done. The eradication of black money and menace of spurious currency linked with various other illicit activities must be dealt with firmly. A thorough cleansing and flushing amalgamated with sanitization of the system are the need of time. The bold and historic step of the government should be augmented further. Common people will fully support it.
0 0 Very first I wish great National Youth Day (NYD) to be celebrated on 12th Jan-17 to every single Indian & our great PM, Republic day is great day as we celebrate with positive zeal. On republic day also Prime Minister should give inspiring lecture like independence Day.India is going in right Direction under our great prime minister leadership. We are very fortunate that we have leader like Shri Namoji.He should remain prime Minister of India atleast for 15 years.I wish Best & Enthusiastic R.D.
