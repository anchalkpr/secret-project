1 0 LPG gas services should be available to all the citizen of India without any control over it. In the rural area, LPG may not be affordable to the people,as they are using fire wood, cow dung, which is available them at free of cost or very nominal at rural area. but, special subsidy for fuel stove should be given to such class of people, so, they can start to use LPG. further, subsidy is the main element to such poor class people, hence, it should be given quickly in bank a/c.,

I would recommend create a similar dataset for all Indian languages for testing character recognition algorithms. http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/acl/H/H94/

0 0 Dear Modiji, I have a simple suggestion that you open various kiosks at significant locations within the city to spread awareness and apt handling of such systems so that citizens would be able to understand their compatibility with them. Such systems were implemented by M.C.G.M in Mumbai to provide city, tourist, public transport info., navigation info. to visiting tourists as well as localites. Also we can implement such systems on trial basis in Ration shops, postal services etc.

0 0 The system can be enhanced to "read" Tamil/Hindi scripts using an in-built camera & translate it to any other language. For example, if the camera of a system (laptop/tablet/smartphone) is pointed to a tamil text, the system shall be able to read that text and translate it to desired language like Hindi. This can be achieved by image processing techniques. Such a system will be immensely useful to decipher sign-boards, announcements etc which may be written in a language not understood by user.
0 0 I was trying to use application, but accuracy seems bit less and looks like there is no correlation between words. When i write words at an angle, accuracy drops a lot, some preprocessing  could be done here. Accuracy could be improved, with large scale neural network and deeplearning. Is there a white paper for this? some suggestions could be done if it available.
0 0 This might be a little off topic but if the system is based on voice recognition then it may also help those people who face difficulty in reading or writing. Meaning that, if the user is asked a question verbally and is allowed to input answer verbally then it may benefit more in some scenarios. System can record the voice responses. Just a thought.
0 0 Hello..I like the system that you are planning to design. But since the every person has a unique style of writing comparing with some of the samples of writings might or might not get a good result sometimes. I have one suggestion here. When a user installs this app, or uses the system for the first time a test sentence which covers all the letters of Hindi or Tamil can be given to the user to type. This way, we can capture the style of writing particular letters for that particular user.
0 0 Sir,you are 100% unique, my best wishes are with you-please encourage business women immensely to make them strong enough.
0 0 As an innovation, we can surly go for this features. And later on, based on this achievement, if we can move further ahead, and design any such device, which can recognize steno writing, and converts into words (with as much accuracy as possible), than this will take a lot's of burden off from the stenographer working in courts, and will speed up the process as well ! #DeitY, #OnlineHandwritingRecognitionSystem, #TDIL, #MyGov

0 0 Namaste,  i have an idea about transportation security, Its like same as Airport luggage checking security, Highways toll is a place where all four wheeler have to stop for toll at least 3 min.  In every toll govt can put X-ray kind of machine to search all stuff with dog squad and vehicle on auto accelerator ( for people safety by X-rays) and same toll they can check driver drunken test or related to motor  act stuff. It may help to reduce sumggle stuff.

0 0 Develop apps for speech to text & text to speech in all Indian Languages. Develop software to convert speech from Major Indian language to English & Vice versa.So a person speaks in Hindi from a mobile converted to English & then person listening mobile device converts English to any Indian languages like Gujarati,Tamil,Telugu,Bengali. This should be done instantaneously & occupy less space.Immediately language barrier in our country is broken. Similarly develop apps for text conversion also.

0 0 It is nice idea to having the hand writing recognition software placed for Hindi and Tamil... But many part of India people does not know to write.. Also this only reduced to two language only. if that is basically for form filling then it is better to have one person one identity(aadhar card). Rather put the effort in this area. We can make use aadhar numbers to fill up those forms automatically. But we need to store signature digitally to check the person consciousness. #DeitY

0 0 Nice concept.As it is mentioned strokes and traces, when the input is given the particular letter has to undergo some stroke of angle which is undefined apart from x and y.In other words what I tend to say is the angle in which each and every word projected as X and Y (in English),so as for Hindi and Tamil going to be unique for each word.Those angle must be under consideration and the high level language must be compiled to low level language as the current Java program.But this level is higher

1 0 A language moment is required. for example prime minister of the nation giving his speech in a language which is not known by more than 5 state people.

2 0 Give inputs for Tamil and Hindi on-line handwriting recognition system is appreciable idea, But there is drawback in it.while recognizing characters,especially in Tamil letters are not correctly translated and spelt.even in Google translation, conversion is worst.So I request Ministry of culture,to look forward in this issue take necessary steps to make necessary steps to inbuilt proper software for each language,just as NHM Tamil typing software so all people can input their view all corner.
0 0 It can be used to digitize legal system's old files. Initially it will have a two pane method to show recognized content vs actual ones. Unrecognized works and characters will be left as it is and highlighted. Plus point here will that a single document will mostly have single hand writing so correcting one letter will correct it at all places in the document. Also, this correction can be done using captchas especially on IRCTC website!! #DeitY, #OnlineHandwritingRecognitionSystem, #TDIL, #MyGov
