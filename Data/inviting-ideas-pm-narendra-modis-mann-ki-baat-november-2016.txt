I also appreciate the measures your government took for easing the problems faced by the citizens post demonetization.

I hope this will go a long way in curbing the black money and corruption in the country today.#MannKiBaat, #AIR, @#PMOnRadio 
9 0 Dear Sir,I request you to have look at "Rise of Outsourcing in private sector" which is indirectly linked to job insecurity and brain drain. Now a days most of the reputed private firms do not take employees on their payroll. For example, Person "A" works in Company "XYZ" but he remains on the payroll of "pqr" company. Payroll company is basically consultancy agency. Most of the employees working in private sector are temporary/contractual employees. They do not get much facilities.

In this case Govt or IT department would not ask as the deposit amount is less than 2.5 Lakhs.  However he/she would not be able to explain source of income as 10 lakh in one year if we sum the total of money.

0 0 Respected PM of INDIA, the recent move of cease of high value currency notes(Rs.500/- , 1000/-) is a right and brave decision, your interest towards nation's upliftment is great, if we also look at our country's population is nealy 1,336,286,256 on may 2016, some some statistics projected to be the world's most populous country by 2022, if we cant take any step it could be a great scares for basic needs, so please aware people about problems of "over population". 
0 0 I presume that the demonetisation which is much discussed is only one of your revolutionary ideas.  I would like to state that the expenses of Govt. of India is too exhorbitant and this needs to be controlled by adding a mandatory column in the APARs of the Heads of each Govt. of India office: "Percentage of expenditure reduced during the Reporting Year as compared to the previous year" and this has to be atleast 25% for which the MoF can issue orders in tandem with the DOPT.  JAI HIND!

0 0 Dear PM, I love your idea for Notebandi, I think most common people are in favor of it. But due to this common man is facing issue for daily buying goods which can easily be solved if we have cash in ATM's and refill ATM as quick a possible. rather than banks have most cash in a branch. As most people are ok with 2000 limit for the daily transaction but ATM do not have cash and people have to go to banks. If ATM has cash available than queues in banks will be very less. Thanks

When I told I am driving since 7 am and could not eat anything as I can't get money from ATM yet. Police instantly gave me cold drink, two packs of Bawaji potato chips and one packet biscuit. I thanked police for this human face. On reaching चितौड़गढ़, I coykd withdraw money from ATM easily with no Q at all.

Just like we have only one voter ID or one Aadhar number or one passport for one person, we may have Centralized, Common "Digital Currency Account-DCA" to be Allotted by RBI..... 
0 0 PM Sir, I find you the best administrator since independence. I am not that kind of expert to suggest you but i wish to share my 'MannKiBaat' with you. Sir, since independence no serious efforts have been made towards population control. I look rootcause of every difficulty of administration in larger population and You can also see the impact in demonetisation too but unfortunately our politicians advise communities to increase  population so that thier community can enjoy the power.

0 0 Sir, I congratulate your government for taking a bold initiative by passing RERA. However, many of the state governments are dilly-dallying on its implementation. Besides, now developers are on a cancellation spree forefeiting the entire amount paid by consumers thus duping the common man of their hard earned money. Worse still, some of these builders are giving an impression that they have strong contacts in BJP. Hence, this point can be touched in Mann Ki Baat.

0 0 Sir, Lead by example and provision for cashless transactions at all govt counters. I have to draw cash from ATM and than book train ticket from counter. Instead, i should be allowed to book tickets using card at ticket counter. Similar things can be implemented at paying electricity bills, bus tickets, municipal taxes, parks etc. Cash management will be lesser reducing chances of black money and would increase govt revenue. 
0 0 Sir, Why you are wasting our money  in the form of MPTC,  Sarpanch,  etc...  In our view MPTC is waste,  no use,  Abolish that and appoint one governor for two states make all Sarpanches come under ZPTC member in a manual and avoid MPP and MPTC also ask the oppositions whether they run the house today or not otherwise u concentrate on otherissues or make mandate to run a house without allegations..

This would surely decrease the pressure. People can easily pay for various txns using basic mobiles. Tv and news media should be extensively used for this widespread teaching.

2 0 Dear Prime Minister, An extraordinary bold decision to transform our India! Still the common man is not understanding the power of transacting cash less. Similar to 8th November address to the nation, please address the common man how convenient it  is for a vegetable vendor to receive money in his mobile. Create short films in all languages demonstrating how to transact cash less and getting money in their mobiles.It could be reached through radio, TV, cinemas, new paper etc. All Now. 
0 0 मी फेसबुक ला केलेली  कमेंट. 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻 आदरणीय प्रधानमंत्रीजी , श्री नरेंद्र मोदीजी , सादर प्रणाम l आप भारत देश के भाग्य विधाते है। एक नया भारत का निर्माण आपकी नेतृत्व में हो रहा है। लेकिन सबसे कठिन समस्या आज पूरे भारत में प्रदूषण की है। दिल्ली का हाल देखो तो पता चलता है भविष्य कितना भयंकर होगा। इसी तरह से महाराष्ट्र में लोकसंख्या बढ़ने के कारण वाहनों की संख्या भी दिन पे दिन बढ़ती जा रही है । और वाहनों में से निकलनेवाले जानलेवा वायु से भारत का भविष्य धोके में आ रहा है। 
1 0 Dear prime minister, The scheme introduced 500 and 1000 rupees demonize is Good, could you please add expire date in the rupees. For example: like a product having the manufacture and expire date. So once the date is expired we need the change the amount through the bank 
1 0 When we have new technologies and updated encryption techniques, why should we use currency that could be forged illegally which is old. If we have that system, then we can be sure the old money returns back to banks and new money is encrypted properly and the chaos we have today is reduced due to unavailable notes. Before the end of the tenth year we can start printing new notes and have them replace the new ones.

0 0 Dear Sir, The Demonetization of the notes 1000 and 500 has crippled the black money hoarders and Terrorist organizations. But do you think the illegal printing of the money hereon and hoardings of cash will stop after this. The initiative taken by you should not a one time thing , this initiative should continue after you are no more as well. The Credit cards and Debit cards have a expiry, why cannot the (paper note) currency have a expiry, say a period of 10 Years. 
0 0 Sir, you are doing a fantastic job. The demonitization move was excellent. However, i have a suggestion. Is it possible for you to hand over medals or recognition certificates to the bankers, workers at the mint, and all those working day and night to get the money moving? That will be a motivation and an appreciation for their hard work. My dad worked for the RBI and I know a banker's responsibility. Please consider my suggestion Thanks Priyanka, Bangalore 
0 0 Dear Modiji, Dont stop half way. We have just started the journey. Rough roads are ahead, after that hope of beautiful road for journey is waiting. We have to make it. 
0 0 Ask all the banker to instruct there customers to write the Payee name along with there account number. And all the account number to be linked with aadhar number and pan number. Let a counter be opened at bank or other central government office to verify the Aadhar number and also issue fresh cards only after verification for duplication. Let the aadhar card be embedded with GPS and linked with specific phone number for tracking. All personal info to be feed in the aadhar card. 
0 0 Hon'ble Prime minister Sir, VERY IMPORTANT To cater to RURAL BANKING NEEDS, the nationalised & Private Sector Banks be immediately directed to proliferate into rural areas, by opening new branches, appointing more Micro ATMS, even if means giving concessions/subsidy by RBI to Banks under category of social activity. It will generate employment & encourage villagers to get introduced to e-Transactions. The BANKING SERVICE needs to be provided literally at the DOOR STEP, in RURAL AREAS.

0 1 Honourable PM Modiji..........I am a former Banker. I have a suggestion for IMMEDIATE DOUBLING OF the availability of issuable currency. New 2000 and 500 notes may be split in to two equal pieces.  Each split piece can be used as legal tender for Rs.1000 and Rs.250 respectively. THIS IS LEGALLY PERMITTED AS PER RBI NOTE REFUND RULES. If implemented within in no time availability and utility of new currency will be doubled. People's will get a big relief. 
0 0 Dear Prime Minister, I request you to devote some sessions of man ki bath to the need of people to urgently resort to mobile banking.you may please spell out all the details like mobile applications of banks, national payment corporation,other applications like paytm,e - vallet,e-transactions etc.people are to be educated on about how a currencyless society can weed out corruption and black money. 
0 0 Hon'ble Prime Minister Sir, To avoid stashing of cash, need policy to restrict availability of currency notes. Suggestions are: 1. Restrict withdrawal thru' ATMS, as existing Rs2000/- per withdrawal 2. Monthly withdrawal not to exceed Rs25000/- 3. Usage of any ATM, any no. of times be at no charge. 4. Limit higher cash withdrawal, only thru Banks with due procedure. 5. Make it MANDATORY by law for Essential Services to accept e-Payments This will promote e-Acceptance. 
0 0 Hon'ble Prime Minister Sir, IMPORTANT Eff 3rd Dec,accepting old Rs500 notes,at Toll Plazas will be counterproductive as every one will present Rs500 note & expect change in smaller denomination. An easier & cheaper way to exchange old notes !. This will create pressure of availability of smaller denomination currency at Toll Plazas & long queues will choke the flow of traffic leading to chaos & criticism. Please make it MANDATORY for all TOLL PLAZAS to accept ONLY E-PAYMENTS thru' CARDS. 
0 0 I'm not sure whether my idea is covenient or not but I would like to suggest that if we motivate every poor common people to open the bank account and also provide them cheque book so they can communicate via cheque payment easily.Also I request every educated people should go with cashless procedures to support this Demonetization battle. Bank should provide cash only for small vendors & needy people where as others educated big people can work with online digital transactions.Thanks ModiG 🙏🏻 
0 0 Modi ji pls add something for bank employees who have worked very hard and also ensure that all bank employees are working honestly as there are some unnconfirmed rumours of bank managers changing money of people in large amount illegaly on commission. Pls tell them as if someone doing this then not only he is making the black money white but also he is directly or indirectly giving help to enemies and terrorists by making their money white. 
1 0 Postal-Agriculture-Railway mass integration: Might this utilize our rich and far out-reaching Postal System. Post-office can venture into commercial food transportation so that farmers can off-load their yield in post-office and get  credit to JANDHAN. Post office in turn will deliver food to every corner of demand through a national integration just like speed post. Any house in Bharat will can get vegetables directly from postman. Orders can be placed in Post offices in advance electronically.

They always aak their teachers to sign on blank register entry...

1 0 In case we have decided to go cashless, please regulate the wallet companies under RBI / Govt. scanner otherwise chaos and corruption might just appear in even more sophisticated forms - like hacking etc. I would like to suggest to let Govt. alone have the universal platform for old, young, handicapped, multilingual with voice support so that no one is deprived. Such platform would reach every corner of the country thru BSNL and be regulated and controlled under strict vigilance of RBI. 
0 0 on demonetisation, please tell our citizens, 'Our govt did this so our children should grow up in an environment in which children of Sweden, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland and Canada grow up. Our govt did it so that our children should have a common future with those children'. 
1 0 Sir,just saw your video of today where you addressed the farmers to use mobile phones for payment scheme..But many of them dont even like to use debit cards.So i think the debit card issue is more immediate now, because asking people to pay through mobile phones will make the farmers scared.First debit cards and the term "net-banking" should be used.Because to a farmer payment through phone sounds misleading. 
0 0 Earlier children used to be abandoned like this but a few NGO's and Governments introduced Cradles for them.Can't we try a scheme or fund for the Black money.The people can deposit those amounts under that scheme. 
0 0 Sir, I totally agree with demonization. Really it's a bold step taken by u. I respect it. 
1 0 Namaskaar Sir, In light of prevailing demonetization, humbly wish to submit - 1. Blind can make out paper and coin currency by feeling them; however if we have decided to go cashless then I am not sure how they will operate electronic exchange. They may have to depend on someone to help them. 2. Aged citizens and illiterates again will find themselves in deep helplessness and confusion to transact electronically instead of conventional cash and may often end up being cheated.

0 0 Sir, our roads, atleast in most cities are becoming a nightmare for drivers & pedestrians alike. The carriage way is shrunk due to hap hazard unauthorised parking, occasionally pavement parking, vendors & extension of shops onto pavements. Many instances of non-working signals & street lights contribute to the chaos. Road cutting works are never completed on time. Almost no one follows road rules, weaving in & out of traffic, like an obstacle course. Our accident record is hence not surprising.

1 0 प्रधानमंत्री जी सादर नमस्कार देश के लिए आपने जो वादे किए आप उन्हें पूरा करने की तरफ तेज़ी से आगे बढ़ रहे हैं, मेरी बधाई स्वीकार करें। साथ ही मेरा सुझाव है कि आपने जो एक वादा किया था कि जो जिस राज्य का होगा उसे वहां रोज़गार मिलेगा, उस पर अमल करने की तरफ भी कदम बढ़ाया जाए ताकि राज्यों से पलायन रुक सके और महानगरों पर जनसंख्या का बोझ कम रहे। इसका सबसे बड़ा फायदा ये भी होगा कि लोग कम पैसे मिलने पर भी अपने राज्य में काम करने को प्राथमिकता देंगे। 
0 0 Dear Prime Minister, I am an NRI and now living in Canada, I fully support the decision of demonetization of Rs 500 and 1000 notes. I am sure you might have received similar queries from so many other NRIs and we want to know about disposal of our currency notes in Rs 500 and 1000, though it is small amount like 10-15 thousands but every NRI has similar amount with them. We do not have ant access to the Indian banks and for such a small amount it does not worth to travel to India. Pls advise.

1 0 Dear Sir, I have a suggestion in driving licence acquiring process. if we have a sensor connected to car and create virtual obstacles with sign boards on the road, the Driver have to pass through the testing process physically however the performance of the driver will be recorded by sensor which records the footprints of a car. The system will give the performance report where the RTO will approve for licence through this we can able to eliminate bribes or process and will get a accurate driver

2 0 Sir, I want to give you an idea regarding use of cashless money. In our country there are many liquor(alcohol ) shops. At these places if you make it mandatory to use only cashless money, then it will be beneficial for everyone. Because only those people buy alcohol who have sufficient money and that type of persons can surely pay by card payment. Black money also controlled. And those who are poor ,who have no card or phone ,they can't able to buy and indirectly there money will saved. Thanks

0 0 We support demonetization move but Government need to be cautious of generation of black money. Few Suggestions: 1. Limited acceptance of cash by banks depending upon turnover of dealer 2. Non acceptance of cash by either sides of matrimonial parties 3. Banking Transaction Tax @ 1% with permissible exemptions 4. Tax deduction at source @ 20%, if cash transactions exceed permissible limits 5. Punishment for demanding payments in cash. People may be encouraged to respond Regards 
0 0 Our dear Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sir,I want to add my suggestions into your the 26th episode of Mann Ki Baat. I want see my country cash-less (not really cash-less),that people must use plastic money, I mean debit cards or e-wallets,net banking etc.I also motivate people to use their cards etc. for paying any amount even for Paani-Puri & autos & car & taxies. PM Sir,tell the whole country to move towards digital modes of payment options. RAJA KUMAR RABIDAS,RAJDHANWAR,GIRIDIH,JHARKHAND 
0 0 Dear OM Sir. One, thousands of crores are being deposited by n Jan Dhan accounts. Clearly this is black money of some one else who on commission basis deposits money in someone's account. Freeze this money for next 10 years after scrutinising the account. Use this money for country. Second. shortage of cash in the banks is due to deposits of Banned notes. We get 100 Rs note everyday but don't deposit in bank for fear. Ensure we ain't harassed on routine deposits of new/ 100 Rs notes. 
0 0 Sir, I recently visited Bhopal and Indore from USA. Problem is Muncipality. Maximum corruption. At ground level, we need to detect corruption done at municipality level. They are misusing funds for personal gain. You need to come up with a way to bring transparency.

1 0 Sir, I can build a Software program for free so that all property information can be collected online. We need to look for benami transactions and only digitization will help. Do not stop now, Young generation need to participate in a big way by using smart phone and recording any illegal activity. 
0 0 sir..... what can i say don't know just says we are always with you... 
0 0 In your radio address, request each younger generation to become a cop. If they detect any fraud like black money, lots of cash, iiregularity by bank manager in any bank, their own house, their neighrhood, ask them to make a video recording from smart phone. Setup dedicated force by hiring recent accountants and asking them to coordinate with Tax agencies and look at video footages. Any one buying luxury cars, property, foreign tickets must be looked at by Tax department. 
1 0 Demonetization Great move. Sir, please link all bank accounts with finger printing authentication of every individual and link PAN/Adhar card with finger printing. Multiple PAN card have been issued to same person for fraud. By linking each PAN with finger printing authentication, we can eliminate duplicate. Need to have a One Property Registry online (All over India) and request all to enter the data. Attach each Property with a PAN and Adhar. Ask for PAN Card # for wife, husband and kids. 
0 0 Hi Sir, My point here is about Swacch bhaarat. For any Indian to put Hands together for this mission there should be driving factor from Govt & related entities involved here. For Eg. If a family is travelling, the only opt for them is public toilets. But the public toilets in all govt/pvt bus stands are expensive(For gents 5/- & for women 8/- and even 10/- as well)@ the same time not swacch. on an avg per person per day 40 -50/-!!.please take action to provide quality and affordable toilets. 
0 0 Dear Modi ji, Make payment compulsorily at petrol pump over PoS machine. And ensure that no charges are debited to account of payer or any charges in percentage to petrol dealer. Or fix charge amount say rupees 1-5 payable to oil dealer for using POS. 
0 0 Sir, tax should be in such a way that it is very less and should be taken from each and every person who is earning something.And this system should be transparent so that people can see their money being utilised. Eg. For toll tax , there should be some display board showing the already calculated amount to be collected. Whenever a person pays the toll tax, immediately those hundred rupees should be deducted. As soon as it becomes zero,the toll tax should be stopped being imposed on the public. 
0 0 Sir, my suggestion to improve law and order in our country. All over india stop recruitment in state police dept.we know most currupt and shameless dept is police dept.Recruit in only army. Fix optimum age for army service then transfer to there state for police dept. pension amount reduce reservation issue solve Army culture will help us to improve law and order effectively. Curruption issue most of solve due to army training.indirect big benefit.Pension amount after retirement of army force

So I am requesting your kind intervention to get cheap internet everybody using money from SIM a/c.

0 0 Respected Modi Sir Demonetisation drive introduced by you is an excellent initiative and has helped in bringing loads of ill-gotten wealth to the banking system, it has also removed fake currency from circulation. If u can present some figures like how much has been collected to far, extent of fake currency removed from system and how this move has helped bring banks for the unbanked like Amul , Tea, Jute workers in Assam WB it'll be really helpful in convincing people about it's success

0 0 Honourable Prime Minister Sir, Demonetization has not hit the black money, corruption and terrorism only but in my opinion it is the biggest blow on the governing system adopted from brits after independence which was designed for a slave India and was based on the ideology that Indians are dishonest where as the golden principle of your esteemed self is that majority of the people of this country are honest. The nation had gone through many political disasters and people have overcome all.

1 0 Tackling Black-money in gold: Apply a provisional tax  (not custom duty) of 40% on gold imports, the provisional tax is refunded if the gold jewelers sell thru cashless transactions. They still pay any income tax that they are due. The gold jewelers also should report the cash they have with them daily or weekly to a compliance register which can be looked to tally books. Small mismatches are ok to prevent harassment of the jewelers.

1 0 Respected PM..to make a clean india..i think the first place to be cleaned is the government departments which is directly under your control. There is corruption in every nook and corner of india. I don't understand how far this black money war is going to be successful when there is corruption even in vigilance and enforcement departments..so sad in my region sales tax officers collecting just 2500 as bribe from cracker shop owners who are liable to pay lakhs of rupees as tax.

0 0 For persons of unorganised sector we usually open Small Savings or PMJDY a/cs. From today deposit of SBN are not allowed in small savings ac's & how the black money hoarders are misusing PMJDY ac's is already brought to ur notice. If we open normal SB ac then the black money hoarders will be presented with a bigger opportunity to convert the black into white by paying commission to the account holders from unorganised sector. I suggest to minimise the opening of ac's during demonetisation.

Today people have to stand in queues for hours to change the money, loosing there one day pay or leave. Now it is bit OK but this should be thought of in the begning. All the ATM as dry with no money. The Rs 2000 notes which we are getting from ATM, there is no change in the market to change. 
1 0 Government should start e-wallet app that may be some kind of similar to paytm and made it mandatory to every shopkeeper to register them to that app.This would be the best way to promote cashless transactions.Today we have very limited shops of daily use that accept e-payment.Even if we want to pay online we have limited options available. If government really want citizens to go cashless it would be a mile stone step in this regard! #myGov

Please do something to get back the cream. Most of the Indian parents are forced to go to old age homes or feeling lonely. May God bless U with long life.Long live

0 0 Dear Modiji, As we are moving to cashless economy kindly ensure safety to card users.  Introduce cards which can be used only for withdrawing and depositing cash in ATMs. Initiate very stringent measures to curb cyber crime. Give as much freehand as possible to IAS, IPS officers without any interference from political leaders. As u are going to clean political system, also clean police system. Give courage to people to complain against corrupt. May God give U more strength, 
0 0 Dear Sir, First of all congratulation on step taken by against "Corruption and Black Money". Every step taken by you is a mile stone in India's growth.Everyone is appreciating of demonetization and we also tell them about the benefits of it.But there is some misconception in public that how will you stop corruption and black money in future as new big currency will be in market.So my request to you is please give assurance to people that you have already made some plan against it,we'll convey. 
0 0 I think the decision to demonetize Rs.500/Rs.1000 notes is taken without proper planning. now RBI has failed PM. today most of the banks are without cash. why new RS.500/ note is still illusive. this decision could have been taken when sufficient currency to re[place was available. why governor of RBI should not be terminated for putting nation into such a chaotic conditions and putting PM in such sorry state. THE NATION NEEDS AN EXPLANATION FROM HIM. 
0 0 Dear Prime Minister.100% support for cashless transactions and hats off to the initiatives taken by the government.However, the rural poor may still not understand the efficacy of the initiative and propaganda of the same may be taken on war footing basis so that the ultimate goal of DIGITAL INDIA dream may be realized soon.

0 0 Dear Modiji, Please arrange to stop printing of Rs.2000/- notes immediately. Please find ways to issue Debit cards which CAN BE USED ONLY TO WITHDRAW CASH as most of the villagers cannot securely use their cards. They may be advised to use wallets only or any other mode which cannot be used for internet banking. 
0 0 Dear Prime Minister.I am personally touched by the initiative taken by your government for Swachh Bharat.Few weeks ago i was in Delhi for a three day workshop in Piccadilly Hotel. During the break time i walked down the street to reach to the next building.I found open urination being done by the public and all the papers littered all over.Community based or local area based awareness initiatives may enhance the programme to achieve its goal.Everyone needs to feel a part of the initiative. 
0 0 Dear Modiji, Instead of criticizing black money control the corrupt people must go to their places and suggest ways and means to mitigate the hardships of people.  One politician who is having an educational institution in Visakhapatnam in AP state went to a vegetable market and distributed Rs.one hundred currency which was collected by his college as fees from students. Our Chief Minister conducted meetings with collectors and initiated lot of measures to help the citizens of AP. 
0 0 Perfect desion for black money. Now will be the great country in This world... Thanks I supported... 
0 0 Respected Prime Minister ji I convey my heartiest congratulations for  bold step taken by you to demonetization of Rs.500/ 1000 notes which will in wipe out the Black Money from our country. If we go through the history first of people from out side the country looted the country  till 1947 and after that the peoples from within country looted till 2014. With our pray you had taken over the reins of the country and we expect great change in near future to convert India as sone ki Chirya. 
1 0 Dear Prime Minister, Good evening !!!!! I think the Jan dhan yosna was the amazing step and later on demonetization is a superb idea who ever says whatever. It is not only to reduce the black money but also a very good step save the country from terrorism. We are more than happy to stand in ATM and bank que line for few months instead of facing terrorism and corruption.The person who is talking against your decision may not be aware what exactly a terrorism is thanks for saving our country 
0 0 My dear Modiji, Some black marketers are criticizing U that poor people standing in queues in front of banks are dead. They should realize BLACK MONEY LENDING (CALL MONEY) in villages has killed how many people ? how many poor housewives and their girl child were forced into prostitution by call money people? how many lost their land/property mortgaged for petty amounts? how much interest they charged: for Rs.one lakh they recovered Rs sixty thousand per MONTH.

0 0 Hon'ble PM. First of all, hearty congratulations on "master stroke" of demonitezing the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. Black money is destroying the fabrics of our beautiful society. It's making the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Please don't let the pressure being put by the opposition wear you down.I salute for the courageous act. My question is what is being done to get rid of the other problem we have in our country, and that is "bribe taking"? It's going from bad to worse. 
0 0 His Excellency,Prime Minister "Charity begins at home" After applying online for Voter I-card, I went for verification at the ERO Chandivali-168 which was in dismal state, after looking the conditions of the office I remembered "Swachh Bharat Mission". So I believe there should be inspections by independent authorities of the government offices especially local offices because if this is done than the faith in the mission of clean India campaign would be cherished. 
0 0 As every small to small village having railway station where problem of bank and ATM is found.And this a good transportation to deliver money on time.The software updation probably takes 10 days.After that that software can be linked to Aadhar Card data like Jio or All bank branches to make easier transactions 
0 0 Dear Sir Here is the suggestion related to demonetization.As this was a good idea but implementing this idea on a large population facing lots of problem. for overcoming from this problem you can create one extra counter at Indian Railways for exchanging money.As all indian railways using the real time software. you can do one thing to add an extra module in that software for the updation of money related data and will generate the receipt for the amount.

Please share simple, easy to understand example of Digital payment in your simple style during next #MannkiBaat so that common man understands and adopts it in his everyday purchase and shopping. Many people seem confused and unwilling to freely adopt to cashless transactions due to some hesitation and comfort with dealing with cash over a long period.

0 0 प्रणाम प्रधानमंत्री जी एक विनती है जब भी कोई योजना सरकार के द्वारा लायी जाती है तो संबधित मंत्रियों को उसकी घोषणा तथा उद्घाटन करने का सौभाग्य दें जिससे वे अपने को जनता तथा सरकार के प्रति कृतज्ञ महसूस करें। इससे सबंधित मंत्रियों को अपने दायित्वों का अनुभव होगा। यदि सारे विभागों पर आप होंगे तो मंत्रियों को आपकी उपस्थिति की आदत पड़ जाएगी और कहीं न कहीं उनके मन में यह जरूर होगा कि आप तो हैं संभालने के लिए। इसलिए उनको भी फोटो पर आने दें। और बार-बार मंत्रियों के विभाग न बदलें। देश बदल रहा है।

None be allowed to contest election to legislature if he already remains the member of legislature.

But in these 15 days I'm watching regularly back door games of money exchange and withdrawal of money from Banks with the help of Bank Employees and general people are waiting outside the Banks patiently. It is my advice to you to control over Bank Employees otherwise situation will become more adverse and you & your Party will pay in upcoming Elections in 2017 & 19 both.

0 0 We all welcome your decision to ban 500/1000 notes. The losers will include people in power viz Govt officers and politicians. Once they lose cash they are holding they will try to make up the losses in new notes. As such the corruption had increased at all levels except top ministers. There is no fear among bribe takers as no action has been taken against them as per public knowledge. It is likely that their rates of bribe will increase many fold making life of common people miserable.

PM Modi Should Say ……Pakistan is Racist by Definition (It’s a non-secular country), its Magna Carta says that it is non-secular, we are not concerned what it is but if it compares with India it should understand it is Racist country by definition, second it is not a stable democracy yet, see how the speculation is made when its army chief Raheel Sharif is retiring, It has a rogue army a rogue Intelligence agency so it cannot be compared to India 
0 0 11.	In Cash currency vs Digital currency Muslim will favour Digital currency as it helps economy to move towards lesser interest rate regime and the muslim wants zero interest rate currency…………so for Muslims Cash currency is a haram money and Cashless is Halal 
1 0 PM Modi should tell Supreme Court in 5 years we will have 3D Printer revolution and we will be printing notes in our home………so the digital currency is the only way forward. PM modi should say as the Cash handling expenses lessens the ban will lower the Interest rates…….the lesser the Interest rates ………..Muslims are also supporting him as they wants zero interest rate currency………..which can only be achieved by 100% digital currency………more the more the digital currency lesser the handling

0 0 प्रिय प्रधानमंत्री जी, कुछ जगहों पर 10₹ के सिक्कों को लेकर बहूत संदेह बना हुआ है कि 10₹ के सिक्के चल रहे हैं या नहीं चल रहे है। बहुत से दुकानदार और ग्राहक 10₹ के सिक्कों को लेने से मना कर देते हैं।और जो ले लेते हैं उन पर 10₹ रुपये के सिक्कों को इस तरह डाला जाता है जैसे कि 10₹ के सिक्के बोझ हों।और लोगों की ऐसी धारणा बन गई है कि जैसे 10₹ के सिक्के की कीमत 10₹ के नोट से कम हो। कृप्या आप ही मन की बात में इस विषय पर तथ्य स्पष्ट करें। धन्यवाद।

0 0 Sir, I support your efforts to eradicate the social evils of our society ie Black money and corruption.Demonetization is a strong decision but the present hardship and inconvenience facing my our ordinary citizen and our farmers also need to be addressed.Mean time the effort taken by your Government to bring back the black money parked in Swiss banks and also the reason for not disclosing their list need to be made known to the public to clear their apprehensions.

0 0 Modi Ji,  Namaste. 1. Introduction of 200% penalty is one way of getting out of the black money, which is currently there... 2. Instead of that why don't you think of levying a nominal tax and ask them to keep the tax suffered money in a Govt investment scheme with lock-in period of 10 years with no interest bearing. This may unearth more amount of money from shadow economy. 3. Here the primary interest is " Unearth Black money" instead of getting tax revenue.

One suggestion would be to issue card payment machine for savings account holders too at minimal cost. With good intent. Thanks.

Now a days every citizen when want to take a loan his CIBIL credit is checked by the banks.  All defaults in credit card pymt, telephone bill pymt, loan pymt is reflected in CIBIL.  Then why not a default in tax payment is reflected in CIBIL.  If it goes to CIBIL banks will be aware of it.

1 0 Sir I would like to bring forth an idea to promote Swadeshi - Make in India - which is a great initiative for sustainable development of India and us. First goal is, we need big market for swadeshi products. India itself is a big market. If we can synergise make in India efforts with our inherent patriotism and local demand we will achieve the goal. My Idea is to ensure consumer awareness about what product is Made in India, by putting a simple tricolor hologram on the product. It will work! 
1 0 SACRIFISING their wishes and break promises made to child. e.g. “This Diwali ( Eid or x’mas or birthday) I will buy you a new bicycle “.  Parents are helpless cannot keep promise.

Now problem is of less than 5% people who have so much that they keep such notes in their house or shop etc. Thanks to all MPs

Regards Champak Das 
1 0 Shri Narendra Modi Je, I would like to thank you for making a so much strong step towards the black money. "I" as a youth personally believe that, it is very good step for our future purpose. In my opinion after flowing of money easily you should stop Big size note (500 & 2000), else it will again start the same thing by which we were suffering till date. you can start some small denomination(150, 200) so that the locking of big currency should not be done again. 
0 0 THANKS  500 & 1000. Not a problem to common people Thanks to all those who contributed to note changing MISSION. Thanks to all bank employees for their hard work in this process. Thanks to people involved in Note printing and transporting. Cash problem is for those who  have a excess cash. Most of the people have total expenditure  less than their income.  Around 30% in my city. About 35 to 40% people can manage their expenditure by SACRIFISING their wishes and break promises made to child.

0 0 Dear PM Sir The recent demonetization of Rs.500 and 1000 currency notes to curb the black money, funding to terrorists and to flush out the counterfeit currency from the financial system has resulted in increase of bank deposits enormously and thus accrued more than one lac crore to RBI in the form of SLR and CRR.

Assume that one shopkeeper per sale is around Rs.30,000. For a complete year 365*30,000= Approximate 2 crores. till this annual transaction tax free. After that 2-5% tax on bases of sale.

We also request you to ensure that the Parliament session is run smoothly as lot of resources and money is being wasted. 
0 0 Respected Sir, I respect your government's intentions behind demonetization. BUT the poor (maids, labours) who do not have a bank account are being looted by middlemen, who are taking 10% commission for exchange.A partial role back by legalising Rs. 500 notes for some time can help the poor. this will decrease the psychological fear among people also. 
0 0 Dear Sir, Praise to your surgical strike on black money but truth is that there are differing views on this move. While the wise understand the hidden motives the others are sceptical about the move. It is my humble request to you to address the farmers and small vendors and others commons about the benefits of the move. I request you to assure them that this move will ultimately benefit them and punish the corrupt. 
0 0 On your appeal, millions of people surrendered LPG subsidy. Can you appeal to government employees especially related to revenue departments to stop corrupt practices.

If appeal does not work ( which is likely to happen) deal firmly to stop this. Country will become clean once it is done.

0 0 Dear Mr. Modi, while demonetisation was a great leap toward countering black money and terrorism, one of the most important step is to promote e-banking or cash less transaction among all citizens, so that a day will come where our country is Note-Free. To console the poor and middle class who believe only in currency transaction, government has to take immediate step in educating the mass on using e-cash. UPI introduced in most of the banks should get more features and user friendly.

Now problem is of less than 5% people who have so much that they keep such notes in their house or shop etc. Thanks to all MPs for putting the problem of cash and queue ( in front of bank) , in the respected PARLIAMENT with such a intensity.

0 0 Judicary: 3. Legal: amend the witness procedures, remove the aim of judiciary ; we can let 1000 guilty persons but no innocent should be punished, instead it should be no guilty person should go unpunished, there should be fear of law in the intending guilty person, every one  should have a feeling that he will definitely face consequences if he does something wrong, every judge and lawyer must be answerable for every delay or cancellation of hearing dates

1 0 Sir,u started great campaign to fight black money,but you made a mistake by not announcing toll free number to report about black money holders. I tried around many numbers of finance ministry, rbi but no one responded well.they simply said that we are not the right platform. Then how a comman man will report about landlords,black money holders. I gurrantee, you personally announce mobile numbers state wise income tax office to report about people having properties.u will see great result. 
0 0 Hon. Modiji, In this problem of Old currency notes please allow animal farmers to sell the Indigenous Cow even by accepting the old currency to the extent of Rs 40000 per animal with the maximum limit of Rs 1,00,000/-.

The farmer should be allowed to purchase seed , fertilizer, pesticides etc, repay of bank loans and depositing the money so received in his own  account.

0 0 The common people have suffered in long queues at banks. Although they feel; your move is right; they are being mislead by opposition parties. If you explain the effect of demonetization of Rs.500/1000 notes on actual culprits holding the black money, people will understand the importance of their participation. common man is still not clear how further generation of black money will get arrested. Please explain. 
0 0 Dear Sir, To spread awareness and moral boost to the rural people about online banking,we can motivate/mobilize the Commerce, MBA and Economics students to take part in a workshop where they can go and explain to the villagers and other enthusiasts as to how can they utilize the mobile banking and its benefits. Every college should conduct a campaign in the surrounding villages with a group of 1-15 students and spread awareness about the mobile banking and online benefits. regards sathya 
0 0 To counter rigged election, my idea is to link aadhar with voter list. machine will open only after aadhar identification. machine can be kept in fewer secured locations involving fewer polling officials. this will cut expenditure. online facilities for voting should be available for police and army who wants to vote online, their name should be removed from voter list so no duplicate voting

0 0 Dear Sir, All have studied the demonetization concept though no one have implemented. First of all thanks for taking such a Lion heat Decision. The other scenario is where PMO/RBI is day by day taking tough decisions after knowing the conversion Technic of corrupt people Though how the money issued by the RBI reaching to these kind of people. Their might be some corrupt or Pressurized Bankers who are supplying such cash. Please tighten the screw on them. Take Care Sir... 
1 0 Respected sir, First of all Thanks for taking the boldest step against black money and corruption we really appreciate your work for nation, I have suggestion, 3 types of areas in India Urban,Semi Urban, and Rural, most of people in Urban and Semi Urban areas are aware and using internet and smartphones, but in rural areas people don't have an idea about plastic money and mobile wallets they don't know how to use that things so i think we should educate them about all this digital stuff. 
1 0 Hello sir, Due to demonetisation, everyone lacks CASH in hands. Those who know Internet banking or use debit or credit cards are the one who have less trouble due to this situation. But what about poor people who doesn't know these online things....they are suffering a lot. My suggestion is to set up free training courses in every area to the people on the topic "how to use net banking, debit cards, credit cards, or paytm." for this, youths can help. THANKS 
1 0 I really appreciate the note ban steps of our prime minister. But final aim of our country should be to become a cashless economy. This is not possible in one day. I have some suggestion regarding this. Please see the modified attached pdf where I added some more point. Previously I also uploaded a pdf file. If Govt is able to implement these suggestions properly, India will be cashless economy (at least 80%) within a decade. 
0 0 Dear Sir, Can there be a possibility where there is one portal developed by the Government initially for the Private Hospitals in Cities and later on for the Practitioners where such Hospitals will make an entry of their day to day patients and treatments and the payments received in cash by them should be limited. This is just a thought can be improved. Thanks for reading me Sir I am with you to awake the Nation form a Sleep. I am with you to try for the Solutions and not Problems.

1 0 Hi sir, My suggestion/Complaint : 1. my IDBI Bank ATM doesn't have sufficient cash. and if I withdraw from other bank or even fill Petrol from petrol pump, bank deducts 11.52 rupees per transaction. But you have already announced that upto 31st December there would be no deduction charges for usage of other bank atm. 2. Tell the nation that Rs. 10 coins are not banned because people are not accepting these . 
0 0 Honourable shri Narendra Modi P.M. of India, Hearty congratulations for taking courageous step of demonetization of 500 & 1000 notes. I strongly support your action. After demonization i would like to do transaction with plastic card (Debit Card / Credit Card) or Net Banking, but we need security for that. Also look interest rate on Credit Card it is very high so common man not affordable credit card. Thanks Satish Kale

0 0 Dear PM, About higher form's fee of Govt. Institutions. I wanna ask, Why many govt institutions like NIELIT and BSNL charge Rs-1000-1500 for their vacancies forms. even they have few vacancies but forms are costly. IITs forms GATE and CEED have fee Rs-1500 and Rs-2200 respectively. Please look for it once. Thank You.

Lastly why goverment beneficiaries(cghs etc) should take permission again from govt. doctors if they want surgery to be done in goverment approved private hospitals 
1 0 I respect your demonitisation step.But matter of fact not everyone who has accumulated black money is ready to deposit it with their id.They'd rather burn the stashes of notes.We...I mean your govt can open an account in name of Army.Anyone who has black money can deposit their money into that ARMY ACC without revealing their identity. Sir this way they(black money hoarders who dont wanna reveal their id)can get rid of money and our soldiers would get money for essential gears & ammunation.

0 0 Dear PM Sir , Demonetisation is a masterstroke and it should not be diluted.Lot of pressure is putting on you to roll it back . Even TOI is also  advocating to bring back " Income declaration scheme again so that black money hoarders can get atleast 55% of the black money back .Pl do not compromise. We r with u.pl restrict cash donations to political parties up to Rs 1000 only and bring political parties  under RTI.Real state  and gold should be targeted next.

0 0 Dear PM, Suggestion for Digital India. I would like you to ask all the learned citizen families of India to adopt 1 person who does not use Debit Card and help them understand the benefits of using plastic money.This could be anyone like the house helps. This will create the next wave of Digital India.Even if each family adopts 1 such person we will simultaneously be educating arnd roughly 140 million people.(ass. 1 pers per 4 edu pers)#MannKiBaat #AIR @#PMOnRadio #MyGov

0 0 Dear PM, I went to kapashera marriage court i found that people are fail to fill the registration form for this some people are charging 2000 . Please hire one more job for filling form and charge RS 100 or high . therefore corruption will decrease 
0 0 Demonitaisation may be good/bad but here rather than acting on high stature people it's acting adversely on people so i think it wld be good if marriage fund limit is extended to 10Lakh also to maintain separate counters for emergency needs like food, medical, funeral, farmers (sld give 100/50notes), Sr.citizens to be much more effective as it wld become win-win situation 
0 0 Dear Sir, Thanks for doing such a grateful work. This should be done every 10th Year to stop the Cash Economy. This was just not the case of Black Economy run by the Politicians,Real estate People. This is the case of Medical Practitioners, Educational institutions, even Rickshaw walas, Warehouse owners, the persons who are hoarding the goods, all gold smiths etc... There are so many persons of kinds. Actually people are being habituated with these kind of activities. 
0 0 Create Small Investment Opportunities for Muslims (Who do not deal in any Scheme which takes/gives Interest Amt, as it is against Islam).After a lot of research I got a way for small Investment is through Foreign Currency Trading in Exchange Markets - But in India Physical Currency Trading by small/Individuals is not allowed even via bank system, & Derivative Exchange Trading is again not allowed by Islam, as it is gambling. Therefore Small investments are not possible. Hv more 2 say bt no Space

0 0 In urban areas situation is quite well now, here ppl are able to manage through Plastic money, online wallet and through plenty of banks/atms. Only 4% of Indian population is paying Income tax which is quite surprising for me. Government should provide some incentive to tax payers in Government facilities like Hospitals, Utility Bills etc. for rewarding these tax paying ppl and to encourage more people for paying Income tax. Plastic money should be promoted in Rural areas. Regards, Ravi 
0 0 It is a fact that many common men are applauding this move even though they bear the hardship. This is because the message is being beamed to them intensely that demonetization was targeted at ferreting out black money and for benefitting the economy. It is also being told that not to support this move is akin to supporting anti-national forces. Neither have they been sensitized to the collateral damage to the economy nor they have been told that this a political move by Modi to destroy politica 
0 0 It is now clear that Modi’s rapier sharp demonetization initiative was targeted to trip political parties that had large stacks of cash, especially those which are controlled by strong regional leaders. But while planning this momentous decision Modi had not foreseen the collateral damage: loss of growth and employment and forced contraction of the economy. 
0 0 Dear PM Sir, Congratulations & a Big salute to you for taking such a courageous decision of Demonetization!! Sir In Rural area condition is bit difficult as no. of banks are very less and economy relies mostly on cash so please instruct banks to focus on rural areas and provide relief through micro atms and other possible means. Government may provide some part of salary/pensions to government employees in cash to ease the situation.

In these 17 days lots of unaccounted money has been deposited in Banks. Please start some relief work for the poor farmers, daily wage-earners and small business people - of course after thorough check on their needs. Also Sir, Please be safe - we love you 
0 0 Respected PM, Thanks for your kind contribution to the Nation. If all among us feel that India is free from corruption. Please only two more steps. Control Police, all local body like corporations. All corruption start from these two body. 
0 0 1) First of all I appreciate for cancelling 500 and 1000 notes to curb to black money. But implementation of 2000 note not useful, it should be banned immediately by introducing 200 and 300 notes. 2) Sri Rama is ruled the country by establishing DHARMA, but in our country, law is very poor, some of the judges are giving false judgements due to who greased their palms and the cases are taking long time ie years together for giving judgement, by that time real person dead.

Most of the educational institutes paying cash to employees. Take list of employees names & family, track their transactions from 9th November to next financial year along with JanDhan accounts. 
0 0 Dear sir, With cash rich banks, loans to small and medium business enterprises loans should be available at cheaper rates. Initiate a national account where citizens can donate money for nation building like defence, irrigation schemes like canals and organic farming. 
0 0 Sir, people demanding demonetization roll back at this juncture do not understand that it is not possible now. it will lead to chaotic economy, and image fall for India world over. It is in the interest of country and the nation overall that the demonetization process is taken to successful completion with all party cooperation and the opposition should give suggestions on after-steps to bring economy on clean and smooth track.

0 0 Dear Sir, 1. Kindly address to ways in which people can access their money deposited in their banks. Usually working hours of people and bank hours are similar. Especially people in rural areas dont have any ATM facility and they go on leave or cant access their money in banks. 2. News ways to go DEMAT of all our assets with the usage of DIGI-LOCKER facility from the central Govt. linked with all the state servers. Which would reduce costing of paper work and also easy access to all asset docs

0 0 Respected Prime Minister, I appreciate the initiative you have taken for tackling quite a few outcomes of the cash economy. My request now is to enable the citizens to go Digital, this could only be done if we can provided awareness and training to public. One idea I would suggest is to Display 10 second ads on TV, Govt Offices, Railway Stations, Schools and also deliver training to people on using Digital Money. With the workforce Central / State Govt have, this should be possible. 
0 0 Respected Sir,Thanks for the All the Nation Building Initiatives By you. We would like to request to kindly make online charges i.e. banking charges, neft / rtgs charges, transaction charges by debit/credit card, bank charges at pos terminals zero. Also if we can have system of getting discounts/rewards/insensitiv if payment is done online  by any means stated above, will add to the increase in same. This can be in form of Rebate in Tax slab say 1℅ extra discount if paid online by above means. 
0 0 Dear PM Sir, Many thanks for banning old 500 and 1000 rupee notes. It will help cleansing the system. Another step which will be helpful is to introduce steps to recruit honest and talented people for government jobs. The recruitment system must be very stringent and it should allow only talented people to land on government jobs purely based on merit. We may need to have a very stringent framework for recruitment throughout the country for government jobs. Thanks & Regards Gopi

0 0 New black money cannot be curtail unless public will motivate to purchase commodities/services against invoice only.Your speeches are the best source of motivation,no advt can do this thing.You have so many followers, it will become a movement on your single speech. Sales tax/I.T employee will create panic in market. Aware S.Tax implement above 10 lakhs and 0% tax on small vendors.Invoice at every point of sale/service either Tailor,Tea,samosa,fruit,it will increase GDP and reflect in economy 
0 0 Dear Sir, your gov cancelled the 500&1000 notes and released the new 500&2000 notes but the cancelled 500&1000 notes collected from entire INDIAN people is that money where goes and what you're thinking that money most issues faced only common people my opinion is most of the people suffered in rented homes so the collected money build a new homes for that persons and use the poor students all state gov's checking in normal vehicals & gov also bcz all back money transport this way 
0 0 Demonetisation is my topic. Modi Ji, those who oppose it cite people's hardships as their reason. Even the former PM, himself being a renowned economist, calls it an organised loot and legalised plunder. It was only an expression of language skills and lacks substance. His words suit more to his tenure as PM. He presided over the largest loot and plunder in history. Corruption rose to 14-digit amount in his time. People know that the difficulties are temporary. The queues almost vanished.

1 0 MRP की धारणा को सरकार ने ग्राहकों की सुरक्षा के लिए लागू किया था कि कोई विक्रेता किसी सामान को लिखे हुए मूल्य से अधिक पर न बेच सके। लेकिन विनिर्माताओं, पैकेजरों ने अब इस MRP का मज़ाक़ बना कर रख दिया है। वो पैकेट पर कुछ भी बहुत ही ऊँचा मूल्य MRP के रूप में लिख देते हैं, और दुकानदार उस सामान को उससे आधे, चौथाई या और भी कम मूल्य पर ग्राहकों को बेचता है, जिससे जितने में सौदा पट जाए। इस लिखे गए MRP का उस उत्पाद की लागत से कोई सम्बन्ध होना चाहिए, ताकि ऐसे ऊँचे MRP न लिखे जा सकें, कृपया ऐसा क़ानून बनाएँ।

People should not have to die in lines just to exchange the currency. Arrangements should be so that they exchange or be able to still use their money by exchanging at local vendors. 
0 1 Being a citizen of India. It's my duty to share following suggestion on the recent demonetization issue. 1. For giving immediate relief reduce useless wait times at the banks. Govt should take urgent initiatives that the currency of 2000rs note should be broken down in several smaller denominations. Besides, the govt should also increase the ATM withdrawal limit to 3000-4000rs daily basis. 2. Regular bank Account holders aren't getting benefits because the non account holders are taking up tim

0 0 respected Sir, your step towards curbing illegal, black money &corruption etc by demonetization of high value curreny is laudable & bold & very timely. it is only a person of the stature of Narender Modi could take such bold & historic decision. may I as a common man suggest that the Govt may consider introducing currency of Rs.400/- & Rs.200/- in place of Rs.500/- to ease the liquidity in due course after the current artificial crisis created by certain vested intetest people gets over. regds

0 0 Dear Sir, Hats-Off to you for demonetization step. Key would be to get as many and as deep as possible penetration of e-payment terminals to merchants along with cards or better still Akrodara model by ICICI should be propagated throughout with some great incentive - as I feel that we Indians love the word 'Free' -  I guess specially after getting a hard fought 'freedom' in 1947. Sir, we are with you in every nook and corner of this globe. - Respects, Arun.

I have few suggestion if you can look into this, it will help our country to grow faster. 1.Please encourage every citizen to file his / her income tax. 2.Pricing regulatory authority for proper product price. 3.Public distribution card must link with PAN and Adhar make it online.

0 0 Goodmorning Pmsir, Bankers say visa & mastercard charges waived on december30th, it'snot correct, the charges debit 1% credit 2% charges way off parmanently, customres not interested to pay the charges at the small retail stores.people can also participate your dream digital india. Thanku sir. 
0 0 Further to my previous comment. Service charge will be easily collectible. Common man and all those paying tax will feel they are benefited. 
0 0 Dear Prime Minister, Common man should be seeing quick benefits of any action by government. Same thing in the case of Demonetization. Those who analyse the actions understand its impact and benefits, but not majority of common man. My suggestion is to give quick benefits which common man can see. Limit all cash transactions to Rs.10,000...and remove all taxation. Make all transaction above 10,000 by card ,digital, or through cheque DD, or through bank and impose a service charge. 
1 0 Dear Pm Sir, I Have a a suggestion about currency ban as we have seen that exchange facility are going to close from today and people only will deposit the money in their account, it's really a very good decision but it will be very difficult for foreign tourist who are staying right now in our country, so this exchange facility should be continue for foreign tourist for one week more and banks should service them on most priority besis so they get the new currency with hassle free mind. Thx 
0 0 Respected Sir, While demonetization of 1000 & 500 currency notes are well appreciated step and we support it with all our strength. Objectives behind the decision can be visualized and future looks to be more better and transparent. My all Good wishes to your leadership. This changed financial scenario of lower deposit earning ratesis causing much concern to retired persons of certain PSU not covered under pension schemes and hence draws your kind attention to speak about your Govt policy. 
1 0 Continuing my earlier message.  Why not the Government provide mobile payment service platform, which is more secure and more people would be willing to use the same. That way a large amount of money residing in the Government hands can also be put to effective use. THIS ALSO REDUCES THE USAGE OF CASH TO A LARGER EXTENT. WHEN THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT MORE PEOPLE WILL USE IT DUE TO FAITH AND SECURITY. KINDLY REQUEST YOU TO GIVE A SERIOUS THOUGHT. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. JB

Make the law minimum punishment to corruption is at least 1 year sismiss them without paying salary 
0 0 Respected Sir, I'm very much appreciative of your demonetization initiative, which has brought out opportunities for players like paytm - mobile payment service platforms - pushing people to adopt the same to use their own money. I know one of the motive behind your initiative is to bring all money transactions out in the open. So, why not the Government also provide the same facility of mobile payment service platform, which is more secure and more people would be willing to use the same. 
0 0 Sir, after banned the 500,1000 so many blackmoney holders are become cashless but some government employees are also there in that list after this they are demanding more money from the people to do any work on government duties .. So please stop corruption make  the laws more punishable that employees ... Once the government employees catched red-handed remove them from the job and give the chance to unemployed people at least they are do the job right way i think it is useful

1 0 Farmers-Giving a portal with buying price mentioned (like gold) for farmers to sell their produces with no middle man. And making sure they get the right price for their produce. Instead of making farmers go and sell the portal should come collect the produce. Farmer can register at these portals and mention crop prior so the portal can assess surplus and vice versa making distribution easy. Adds faith in the farmers their effort won't go in vein looking for buyers..

0 0 Respected modiji,I am delighted by the action of black money and hope an action for removing corruption in state and municipal offices also,where the common man goes daily and have to deal with the staff who have long habit of expacting money (considering it their legitimate right) and delaying the process of working.Hope a measure in near future to curb the corruption at these levels which will give a big relief to a common man. Congratulations on the good work.regards

This will increase government treasury - more economic  reforms …. 
0 0 Dear Sir, please speak about demonetisation and the benefits it will bring in medium to long term. People are currently being misled by oppositions comments. Hopefully your scanner will be on benami deals, land mafias and also public housing initiatives for common people.

I have been living in Canada for 10 years now and the steps to a cashless society in India , is surely step in right direction and living in Western Society ( where 95% of transactions are digital ) your dream for digital India is achievable. It will take time, but under your leadership and great team, it will happen. So, please don't stop. Soon, people will appreciate its benefits and added convenience in their lives.

Demonetization is being experienced second time by this nation..for many it is their first such experience..Initially i jumped at the very declaration that night..several messages exchanged..But, this crowd is not decreasing..Did you really have an idea that the situation will reach this level that people will fight and kill..You probably got deceived 
0 0 PM sir,with great respect we urge to know the logic behind introducing 2000 note instead of 1000 ...in the long run, will it not be relatively convenient for corrupt people to transfer the amount as merely 50 of them will make 1 lakh ！Despite safety features will it not encourageduplicacy ？Was 500 rs note not enough to run the economy ？Your step is bold enough to change the behaviour of a  nation...But we simply need to know the idea behind Rs 2000 note as lay man....otherwise hatsoff to you... 
1 0 It should be the collective resposibility of MPs to remember these martyrs before the session everyday.. All MPs should rather 1. While parliament in session, both the houses should observe silence for our martyrs. 2. MP of martyr's constituency should present the martyr's story, achivements, scarifice and family condition. 3. Concerned MP should appeal for individual contributions from house to fund education of martyr's children. 4.MP spend some time on border.. Jai Hind

Please make a statement that you will dismiss all such managers/employees who ever is involved in such illegal activities. You need to take some steps like this to make demonetization a grand success. BEST PM EVER!

0 0 Dear Mr. Prime Minister Namaskar My suggestion is for controlling black money : 1. Pls allow common men to claim their house hold and personal expenses from their annual income ( only non cash expenses ) : same as companies : this will save them on income tax where government will loose on one hand as income tax but on other hand it will win by making more money though sales tax on their purchases vs current senario is that if somebody can save on sales tax they will happily pay cash.

1 0 My Suggestions for INCREASING DIGITAL TRANSACTIONS are : 1. 0 % Cash Transactions for Buying any Vehicle. 2. 0 % Cash Transaction for Buying Real Estate. 3. All Businesses with turnover more than 5 Lakhs should COMPULSARILY be accepting Debit Cards/e-wallets as there payments. 4. All Such Businesses should be PENALIZED if they Deny accepting Digital Payments. 5.All extra charges of Digital Transactions should be subsidized by govt. to promote it. Extra Income tax will make up for subsdy

0 0 Resp. PM, we all are aware of the extreme sacrifices being made by our soldiers and later on the difficulties being faced by their families. In this regard I have two suggestions, a) Build new educational institutes for the children of martyrs and till the time such institutes are developed give them reservation in all the schools and colleges across the country. Give free and quality education to their children. b) Request corporate houses to adopt the families of martyrs and help them 
0 0 Now that public overwhelmingly supports PM Modi on demonetization in Poll opinions my question is whether the opposition represents people in this representative form of Govt.? Are they the representatives of the people for the people once they are elected by the people? In the past Governments were not doing what they were elected for - their poll perspectives! Is this not the time to make alternative representations mandatory for implementations. Shameless is the unity of opposition leaders.

0 0 Sir, With your 8th Nov. announcement on demonitization of Rs.500 & Rs.1000,we the common man are facing lot of inconvenience. Instead of bringing Rs.2000 note, why can't it be Rs.200. Let ATMs in this country dispenses 200 & 100 notes only and counters in the banks collect 500 & 1000s with constituting extra counters and using the services of retd employees of Banks. sufficient no.of currency may please be put in ATMs at frequent intervals to draw the money to avoid panic and unrest.

To solve this problem i suggest that money so deposited on account of HD notes may be converted into 10 years fixed deposit in the name of the account holder.

I think no account holder will have any reason to object.This shall take care of benami deposits and  poor account holders and their family members will be delighted

After this common people have got an idea to have digital world around them for reducing corruption. As we know that we the people of India forget things very fast  to continue this they have to be educated and forced to adapt digitized money transfer. for this a task force from within the departments to be made. 
0 0 One suggestion to overcome the present situation fast could be using cheque , the only problem is that same may bounce due to insufficient funds . Though protection is available by seeking legal way but same is not practical. Instead if for cheques it is adopted as that if the issuing party's cheques bounce thrice due to insufficient funds (Implying that he issued same deliberately with intention not to pay) then his all account gets freezed as penality for some time

They feel tensed for quality seeking educational work. But quality compromise is leading to risk for the further growth and development of  country.

So please see how this black money could be utilized to build this project for the welfare of Humanity to progress in a righteous spiritual path. 
0 0 Sir, The benefits to national security from demonetisation are immediately visible. Maoists are surrendering in their 100s in Chattisgarh, Odisha and Maharashtra. Without national security, there can be no growth and prosperity. Demonetisation has contributed to national security by hitting terror/Maoists funding real hard.I am glad to queue up at ATMs/banks for my safety and my countrymen's safety. CA Srinivasan Anand.G 
0 0 Are your schemes awareness reaching every home, every youth, every parent in every village, Mohalla, street in every class B and class C towns? Answer is "No". How it can reach? The best idea is that there should a separate wing in Skill Development who can counsel the beneficiaries for getting the benefits. The counseled people never oppose the schemes because they would be understood the important of these Schemes. No one can induce anyone against the government if they are getting benefits. 
0 0 आदरणीय प्रधानमंत्री जी आपने जो 500 और 1000 रुपये के नोट बंदी का फैसला किया बहुत ही बड़ा और काले धन रखने वालों पर करारा प्रहार है इस फैसले से समूचे देश की जनता खुश है । जो लोग इसका विरोध कर रहे है वो बहुत ही निंदनीय है। ये वो लोग है जो अपने स्वार्थ की खातिर राष्ट्र धर्म भूल गए है । इनकी तरफ ध्यान ना दे । महोदय आप से देश को बहुत उम्मीदें है । में और समूचे देश की जनता आपके साथ है

1 0 इसीलिए कोई बड़ा आदमी पुराने नोट बदलवाने के लिए बैंक के बाहर लाईन में खड़ा दिखाई नहीं देता क्‍योंकि वह अपने गुर्गो/नौकरों को लाईन में लगाए रखता है । 
0 0 Congrats to Modiji for this bold Note Ban move. What is required is more contact with people to inform them the advantages of this move. Govt shd also give updates on quantum of deposits on daily or weekly basis. The  news  that Rs 5 lakh was collected was good news. It has to be followed up with updates. Similarly no of ATMs re Ali rated shd be given on daily basis. Last figure was 82000. What next? Why Govt is silent on facts. Even about size of queues will help. Finally where is RBI gov? 
1 0 Dear sir make ATM and debit card and swipe machine compulsory for every shop office and even at homes to credit or debit goods and services than there will be mminimum requirement of cash. 
0 0 अब तो स्‍कीम को चले 15 दिन हो गए हैं । जिनके पास बैंक खाता नहीं हैं वे अपना खाता खुलवाऍं । खाते में ही पुराने नोट जमा कराएं और नए निकलवाऍं । नकद में नोट बदलवाने की सुविधा तुरंत बंद हो, अन्‍यथा माफियाओं और विराधियों के कारण सरकार ऐसे ही संसद में और जनता में कोपभाजन का शिकार होती रहेगी, और अंतत: प्रधानमंत्रीजी की नोटबंधी योजना को ये सफल नहीं होने देंगे ।

0 0 Respected sir, Iwant to share a thought of rural development of rural areas.Nowaday we can see the collection of waste through municipal corporation.but my idea is to collect waste notonly city but also in rural areas.that is we distribute dustbins to each house in a village.and ask or warn them to throw waste and everyday a van come and collect the dustbins.if they neglect to do it we gonna cut thier pensions rations and other facilities.If this happens we can see green villages without wate. 
0 0 Like agriculture land, there should be ceiling for residential land / flat area. example: maximum 2 flat or 400 sq. meter land in name of one person / family. N.S.Vedic 
1 0 नकद में 500-1000 के पुराने नोट बदलवाने की सुविधा तुरंत बंंद हो । लोग अपने खाते में ही इन्‍हें जमा करें । बेईमान इस सुविधा से भी काले पैसे को सफेद बना रहे हैं । ये, जैसे बिल्‍डर 100 मजदूरों को रोज लाईन में लगाकर 2 लाख को सफेद बना लेता है । लाईन बनी रहती है । इन माफियाओं के कारण जरूरतमंद गरीब का नंबर ही नहीं आता । ऐसे ही ये बड़े लोग बैंकों में सांठगांठ से रोज 50, 100, 200 आईडी देकर बिना लाईन के पुराने नोट बदलवाते हैंं, गरीब का नंबर आने तक कैश खत्‍म हो जाता है और सरकार को गलत ठहराया जाता है ।

0 0 Dear sir, taxation should be linked to the facilities that are being provided by the government an individual paying 10lakhs worth of income tax should be provided for example better treatment at say hospitals, freeway on roads, pension etc as against a person paying 1lakh tax. this will motivate people to perform better and pay more taxes 
0 0 PMji,we were knowing in 2010 that drastic action against corruption will be taken by the Country in 2016.

0 0 Dear Sir, I Support you 100% as our PM & Your recent drive of demonitization. The idea is as good as its execution & unfortunately I have to admit the execution of this is big failure. People are suffering as this great idea is poorly planed and even poorly executed. One reason of failure is corrupt delivery system which is being misused by people to convert black money into white. We call banks they don't have money, ATM are dry and people are suffering. Please help to fix this quickly.

I have two suggestions - 1.Our Military personnel including Para-Military forces should be given best benefits available in our country for self and dependent family members. 2.Existing Railway Network system should be Safety-audited thoroughly by Indian Experts from IIT or like Organizations, and all the recommendations should be adopted one by one, before embarking upon any further expansion move.

0 0 I wish to suggest one point about the current initiative viz, Demonetisation. Govt and RBI have declared that they have enough stock of New notes. Considering this situation,Please permit all the savings bank account holders to withdraw as much as they need but upto maximum balance in their account as on Nov 8, 2016. This will create a positive picture. The deposit account can be Savings,Current,Fixed (mature/premature) or any other type of deposit.

There are lots of areas you have to put your efforts into as we have lost over 6 decades of misrule and corruption at all levels. The real culprits are on top of the pyramid. You have to neutralize them first before you could move down the ladder. Have you considered sharing facts on potential economic growth?

0 0 माननीय प्रधान मंत्री जी, शतशत नमन। महोदय शायद आजादी के बाद पहली बार लग रहा है कि देश में कोई फेसले लेने बाला नेता है और जो आपने कर दिखाया है शायद आज तक किसी ने सोचा भी नहीं होगा और ना ही सोचने की हिम्मत कर सकता था। लेकिन शायद नोटबंदी का फेसला लेने से पहले इसमें आने बाली परेशानियों को ध्यान में नहीं रखा गया था और यही कारण है कि आज इसके कारण कुछ आदमियों को इससे काफी परेशानी हो रही है और जो फेसले बाद में भी लिए गए हैं उनसे भी लोगों की परेशानियाँ कम नहीं हुई हैं।

0 0 Dear Sir, My suggestion would be to start thinking about giving some additional benefits to people who pay income tax beyond defined limit. May be a portion of income tax paid by someone in its life time, gets redirected to medical insurance policy so that when the income stops, that person is guaranteed free medical treatment in all hospitals as per terms of the insurance. I feel that people would be willing to pay 1-2% more income tax if they are guarantee these kind of benefits. Thankyou..

0 0 Hi, I would like to present my idea of social security benefits. I will keep it short here and ofcourse we can go in details: Based on the tax amount slab if users are given social security benefits then people will not mind paying taxes. There are lot of mid scale business man who do not see any visible benefits by paying taxes. People are ready to pay tax and even slightly more if they are given some child school benefits, hospitalization benefits etc. based on the tax slab given by person. 
0 0 Dear Mr. Prime Minister, The  demonetisation move of Rs. 500 and 1000 is a good move to unearth the black money and teach lesson the the tax evader. However, your preparation was not good. Before taking the step you should have pumped a plenty of Rs. 100 currency. Secondly you should have printed only Rs. 500 currency of size similar to the old note. This would have made your scheme a great success. By implementing the scheme without giving serious thought, the poor people have suffered a lot. 
0 0 Sir you should Allow income tax officers free from any pressure so that they can raid on the offiers and politicians houses or farm house because common man doesn't have black money these people have black money  sir you should keep in law maximum of 1000 rupee note because after sometime people will do corruption by 2000 rupee note and it will be large amount from now a days.

0 0 Dear Mr. PM, I have a suggestion for huge money collection at some of renowned temples/mosques etc... and organizations. Instead of building huge structures, invesing in gold (religious or otherwise), there can be a collection set up by Govt and use it in structured way to payout social secutity, shelter to one generation of families below poverty line. The children get free meal and schooling as mandatory. I am sure this will be a constructive step towards eradication of poverty. 
0 0 It is important to know that right from november allthose organizations, institutes specially in education sector professors teachers and subordinate staffis paid with cash salary . Respected PM kindly do check sach ttransatio who have received cash as ssalar . By taking black money as salary in cash. It become white . When all the employers are ordered to pay salary as NEFT why now salary is being paid through cash. Kalgidhar trust baru sahib paying old notes plz check it .

0 0 Sir, I support swachha Bharat. But now where in our area it is implemented. There are no roads in our colony. Open defecation is common. There are not dust bins. Drainage is left on the roads because there is no drainage system. Recently our village is converted to municipality and they always says no money to do any thing in spite of our paying taxes regularly. But so many house holds do not pay tax because no facility  is provided. I do not understand why rich colonies are well maintained 
0 0 Dear Prime Minister, My age 38 years, I am not  higher educated, you can say like i am not graduated, i had to leave my study in mid, i wanted to study, but that was not possible for me, why, can you think.......... 
0 0 India can have a change to transform from DIRTY INDIA TO SWACHCH BHARAT.Since everyone is worried about slowness in business sentiments and growth being decimal .My view are as follows :1.For short term we should invest in Export and IT sector to get high productivity and in Long Term India should focus on Infrastructure, as infra will give slow returns.Utilize the unproductive assets like sick mills,retired people and women from rural area to get more productivity in short term. 
0 0 Dear Mr.PM, First of all, I want to thank you (or rather say on behalf of all citizens who pay tax) for your vision on making India corruption free. I have suggestion Jan Dhan account misuse. After reviewing historical balance in those accounts, Govt should take a step to confiscate all the money leaving Rs.30,000 in the accounts for the poor people as a benefit of doubt. They may use this money as a gift from Government and will be motivated to support. 
0 0 Respected PM Sir, I am a practicing Chartered Accountant. I support Demonetisation of Rs 500/- & 1000/- currency notes. I present before you my suggestion for reducing transactions in cash. 1. There should be a limit of cash withdrawal from bank after which a small percentage of cash transaction tax be imposed. 2. There should be a limit to the percentage of total turnover which can be done in cash over which cash transaction tax be imposed, over a exempted cash turnover for small traders.Thanks 
0 0 Sir, i support demonetization. But the way in which it is handled is not appreciated. I am in a village Sri Rama Colony , in jalapalle, . Because of me and my friends efforts we have got two banks. But there is no money in the banks people are suffering. 
0 0 500 और 1000 के नोट पेट्रोल पंप, रेलवे, बिलिंग काउंटर, रजिस्ट्री ऑफिसेस पर 24 नवंबर से बंद कर देना चाहिए। क्योकि इन जगहों पर भी पर ब्लैक मनी को वाइट में बदली जा रही है। प्रधानमंत्री जी की योजना को सफल बनाने के लिए ये बहुत जरूरी है। ऑनलाइन मनी ट्रांसेक्शन को बढ़ावा देने के लिये बीएसएनएल 2G internet सेवा को पूरे देश में free किया जा सकता है। जिससे लोग ज्यादा से ज्यादा इ ट्रांसेक्शन कर सके। या फिर बहुत कम रेट पर ये सुविधा दी जा सकती है। सभी टोलनको पर इ पेमेंट की सुविधा करना चाहिए। 
0 0 I wish to remind that in the name of demonetisation, many have forgotten the Train Accident killing more than 100 people in Kanpur. Also the tough situation with Border forces are facing in LoC in the recent few days. 
0 0 Why can't we make law which will allow only those people to have voting rights who pay tax. If any person pays more tax then his vote weight will be equal to his tax. Example if I pay 200000 rs as tax then  my vote will count as 200000 points.

One important thing we have to do sir, such as " we have to introduce a law to avoid the withdrawal of this in future by any government".

Thanks, 
0 0 Dearest Modiji, I am a small trader of bicycles from Koppal Karnataka.From past 5-6 years many state Governments are engaged in distributing bicycles to school going children. No doubt its a very good idea to bring back left over students to attract back to school. But I would like to highlight to you that there has been a biggest curruption been done while adjusting the price of the bicycle. And more over the benificiaries of the bicycle are also not making use of it.

0 0 Sir, Recently, while purchasing a mobile phone,from Reliance Digital outlet I offered to make payment by cheque despite submission of valid documents, my offer was declined. Sir, if we can have a clear guidelines regarding Cheque payments, at least a legitimate instrument of payment won't be dishonored. These instances encourage all monetary practices which most often are dishonest and contrary to our pledge of cleaner India. Thanks sir. #AIR

Garbage if segregated and packed in different color bin bags from point of generation is very good and lorry can collect in the morning. I have seen the practice in some parts of south India and developed countries.

I suggest, open a portal for people to upload their land details with adhar, you may give 2-3 months for this. Have team of officers who will go through give appointment & land will be measured with latest GPS based equipment & property card can be issued to him. This will help to identify benami, Govt. will get lot of land & disputes related to land will be reduced.

0 1 Why can't we make law which will allow only those people to have voting rights who pay tax. If any person pays more tax then his vote weight will be equal to his tax. Example if I pay 200000 rs as tax then my vote will count as 200000 points. 
0 0 Dear PM Sir, Good Evening & Many Many congratulations on recall of Rs.500 & Rs 1000 currency notes Its really helps our country towards fake currency & corruption and makes Clean India !!!

We the people are with you !!! Thanks & Regards Ketan Kumar Cont. No. 00919723942629

0 0 Respected Modiji, We have always shown our population of 125 Cr as a strength of our nation. While this is true, we must also understand that being the second most populous country in the world is also a matter of worry. With increasing population,we have less land to live, fewer schools and hospitals to benefit people and infrastructure is being pushed to its limits. I would really like you to take some initiative to generate awareness amongst people towards population control. Thank You. 
0 0 Sir, the bold step of Demonetization has raised hope of brighter India. Those hit by it are raising storms. But sir, this movement should go on as conceived by you. Few suggestions-1. Scrap the I Tax 2 Make monetary transactions digital. 3.Enforce BTT But most importantly,4. PLEASE MAKE SCHOOLING REALLY MEANINGFUL. 5.Teaching SHOULDNT be an amateurish venture, but should be taken as a Professional Task with well written task and goals to achieve. Thanks, Sir. #MannKiBaat 
0 0 Respected Prime minister sir ,  strict punishment policy for crime against women is the need of the hour ... a few words from you will send terror wave across offenders ... hoping for your kind attention 
0 0 Respected Modi Sir..The technology in printing plastic notes involves highly sophisticated processes. So it would be highly difficult to manufacture duplicate notes.Thus distribution of fake and duplicate currency notes can be controlled.Sometimes people write unnecessary things or slogans on notes. Currency notes lose their beauty if we write anything on them.The plastic bank notes would last longer by 4 years compared to one year for normal,Indian Citizens are ready to welcome plastic notes. 
0 0 Congratulations sir for taking such a strong step.. Although I don't know much about all these things but when my father explained me.. Then i came to know about this things...thank you sir for taking this strong step and again congratulations for my family..... 
0 0 Why can't we make law which will allow only those people to have voting rights who pay tax. 
0 0 In schools only theory is only delt with. practicals are not given to do by themself. Only teachers show it. Most schools do not have proper lab and instruments. Personality Developement is just a book complision issue. in our city 90% children copy the whole PD book. Insist more on practicle. 
1 0 After demonetisation, there are people who are helping black money holders in changing old currency. So Government can made it compulsory to all people/organisation to file return with identity proof before 30.11.2016, regarding the number of notes along with denomination either at the banks where they are holding accounts or at the website of income tax. this will help in checking further back dated transactions and money laundering.

STARTS UP CAN GET TREMENDOUS BOOST 4.FDI INFLOWS SHOOTS UP 5.MAKE A RATIONAL LOCAL BODIES  PROPERTY TAXES WHICH ENCOURAGES TO PAY TAXES. 5.MAKE AND ENCYCLOPIDIA OF A2Z CORRUPT PRACTICES AT ALL LEVEL 6.GIVE UNIQUE EMPLOYEE NOS TO PRIVATE & PUBLIC SECTORS JUST LIKE AADHAR CARD & MANY MORE IDEAS TO CLEANUP MISSION

0 0 Respected Prime Minister, I remember how Mr. Atal Bihari Vajpayee negotiated ceasefire with Pakistan in 2003. It dramatically decreased terrorist infiltrations and brought a period of calm in the valley. The current situation of cross-border firing is not helping our case as it acts like cover fire for the terrorists to infiltrate. Let us approach Pakistan for a cease-fire because Pak isn't mature enough to do that. In your Mann Ki Baat address kindly make an appeal to Indians to be patient.

0 0 All ngo & political parties collect donations & deposit in bank. Its tax free also. So any intrest accrued on such account should go to govt and not the account holder. Such account is having huge balance and earning intrest for which they are not eligible. Because its not their hard eraned money and not paying tax. They collect money for doing social services and they don't utilize it and earn intrest on the bank balance. Any intrest on such account should go to govt.

0 0 Prime Minister you can concentrate on rural economy in this mann ki baat about the effect of demonetization in their zone and the steps government have taken and are going to take so as to make them more liquid as your voice is heard in every nuke and corner of this country. You can also motivate them about the benefits of rupay/debit card and the usage of cheques.It's worth trying. It will take a generation and a half to migrate them to proper channel and i am not understanding them. 
0 0 immediately install CCTV CAMERA in all banks to control bank corruption over demonetization. 
0 0 Sir, if u pl.give some immediate relife to all income tax payee if they spend less than 10% of their total income in cash then at least they will start participating in less cash society. 
0 0 Please install CCTV Camera in rural area banks to control their activities. most of them are not having CCTV CAMERA and they are converting black to white by earning commission. openly they are offering black money owners to convert their black to white. Please control this before villagers go against demonetization. 
0 0 Please beware, Rural India is suffering due to irresponsible behavior of bank employees. they are busy in converting black to white of BIG GUNS and common poor people are not getting their own money. Urban citizen can manage by online/card/epayments but rural people have only cash option. Bank and atm are not sufficient there and corruption of bank is making it worst experience for poor people. most of the banks have no CCTV Camera in rural area.

I can stand and support him even if I am asked to forget my personal interest and walk to some extra mile. Thankyou Sir for living on our expectations"

Any one can deposit money in any currency and will pay 2% as fund maintenance charge per year. Account will be operated with password only. This will help in curbing the black money going out of country and problem of money not in circulation can be resolved. 12. In Hisar, Circle rate for HUDA, shall be reviewed.

0 0 Dear Sri Modi ji- your decision about demonetization is just mind boggling & as a senior chartered accountant I support it. However I fail to understand why people in cities need to exchange the old notes.  They can simply deposit the old notes in their bank account and withdraw new notes.  By giving this facility of exchange malpractices are happening.  Yes for villages, uneducated persons, old persons it can be the exception. 
0 0 Your historic step to curb corruption is demonetisation and people from every walks of life are vociferously appreciating this. Under the predicament I would like to see change in work style of RTO of different states. In Assam we are rather compelled to buy our cars and two wheelers from showroom as dictated by RTO. Showroom owners sell cars only after one deposits other money for registration etc. and thereby the charge more than stipulated money. Another form of fleecing money is stamp duty.

0 0 Dear Sir, I fully support the demonetisation process initiated by you. There are certain things which need to go to the grass root level. There is a common trust on cash-based economy at the lowest level of common man, these constitute a very big chunk of the society. These people are neither tax payers nor use large denomination of currency in most of their lives. There interest need to be protected while implementing decisions on curbing black money.

0 0 Thank you for bringing in the Demonetisation Scheme. However now transporters could not able to move their trucks as they do not have cash for driver. Majorly money is used for Fuel refill of truck. Oil PSU can develop the system of prepaid payment card. Transporter can fill payment card with an amount & give to driver, which driver can use to fill fuel in truck at any retail outlet in the country. If required this system can be develop and implemented within a week. 
0 0 प्रणाम मेरे विचार से भारत को समृद्ध बनाने के लिए हर व्यक्ति कि शिक्षा और स्वास्थ्य की प्रथम आवश्यकता है, हमे अपनी संस्कृति के हिसाब से ही अपनी जीवनशैली को बदलना होगा ताकि हम और हमारे बच्चे स्वस्थ रह सकें, आजकल की कामकाजी जीवनशैली ने बच्चों से उनका बचपन, जवान से उसकी अठखेलियाँ, व्यस्क से उसका आनंद व् बुजुर्गों से उनका सुकून छीन लिया है और अंत में इतनी भाग दौड़ करने के बाद भी हम जीवन के आखरी पड़ाव में खाली हाथ ही रह जाते हैं जबकि पुराणी सभ्यता के अनुसार हमारे घर के बूढ़े बुजुर्ग कभी परेशान नही थे

0 0 Modi ji, As they say children are the pillars of future. For a growth oriented country kindly rope in CBSE, ICSE, Govt and state board school to educate and propagate the correct usage and advantages of digital money, and in turn let these children go back home and educate their parents about the same. Or schools or colleges can become nodal agencies to educate people about this drive. Regards. 
0 0 sir you are the most dynamic pm of india so far. you hardly sleep as you have launched programmes and schemes one after the other. but are all these schemes being backed up? is someone standing at the back of each scheme being launched to supervise it and see whether the work on it is being done ? kindly tell the nation that how work is being done on these schemes. the latest demonitisation is a wonderful scheme but to be implemented properly. money should reach very fast to poor and needy fast 
0 0 Hello PM sir, एक तरफ BLACK MONEY बंद हो रहा है और एक तरफ कुछ बैंको में BLACK MONEY बदला जा रहा है 30-40 कमिसन से. ईसलिये आप बैंक मे काम करने वालो हर एक का अकाउंट जरूर चेक करे. इसे रोकने के लिए कुछ कठोर कदम जल्दी ले यही आशा करता हु ! पूरा भारत आपके साथ है. जय भारतमाता.
