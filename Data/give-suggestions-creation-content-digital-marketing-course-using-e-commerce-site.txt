0 0 Govt can give new platform to farmers , by starting a website ,Direct farm to cosumer , that website will work as on same concept as Ebay is working . All farmers can make their Id and put details of their crop with details of seed and wheather it is organic or not . And himself quote minimum selling price with pics ,  This concept will work on wholesale market  ,consumers who want to buy those can call directly to farmers and talk about transportation details and get deal finalised . Website will not be responsible for quality and transportation . Consumer will give grades to farmers id according to their experiance . Farmers who are in protected farming and organic farming should be added on priority basis because govt already have their data . They will register themself on website in no time. To take consumers to such website will need some awarenwss work to do , As people who are going to have marriage in home, hotel and dhaba owners even rehari owner will start buying directly when they will know about such website . We can help farmers by this simple idea . Which is cost effective and move digital India one step forward . 
0 0 The news, "Call rates, SMS to cost less while roaming from May 1 2015 - now, with hands in glove nexus with TRAI, Telecom operators will charge different packs -  another trap for Indians to get more cheated. Indians are the victims of materialistic positivism. Boycott telephone use for 6 months to break this nexus between TRAI & Telecom operators and to have 'one India' - one SIM card and 'one tariff'' and 'free number portability across country'. Competition must be on reach and call quality.

First of all, rural places do not have good idea of computers let alone learning a course.The approach at them should be very basic and clear so the following are my views- -website available in local languages -should be easy to navigate with simple instructions -a short term course, a video or pictorial representation on how to navigate, upload and market the products can help them -a helpline 
0 0 I know the last date was 16/1/15. For whatever it is worth, please consider the following inputs: 1. The target audience needs to be able to use an e-commerce platform to sell their products. 2. For this, they to be taught to upload a picture, provide a description, quote a price on the target portal. 3. You need the portal to be simple enough to use so that the users can easily add the above. I do not see the need for the elaborate course.

I would like a new department from the government who would analyse our ancient Hindu text and come up with innovative scientific research. This would help India become a strong nation.

It is right time to have an R&D for using our ancient texts to innovate new technology in med & science.

Hence the e commerce has to cater to the needs of digital marketing as both are interlinked, directly proportional to each other as per importance.

2 0 The delays and cost overruns, under utilization of resources prevail at all level in Indian Infrastructure Project. The economic growth depends on its key resources perform to or exceed baseline productivity and efficiency target. If a Nation’s productivity increases day by day, the Economy will run smoothly and reduce Government Expenditure. So Infrastructure Project Completion on Time and Within Cost Reduce High Government Expenditure. 
1 0 India does not compare favourably with other countries in executing projects. Data from government and industry suggest that on average, each project suffers from 20 to 25 per cent time and cost over-runs, while in some sectors this is as high as over 50 per cent. Further, discussions with leading industry players suggest that Indian providers (engineering, procurement and construction or EP&C companies) often fail to tap significant opportunities to reduce time and cost. 
2 1 Infrastructure projects in India are infamous for delays and cost overruns. Recently commissioned, Bandra-Worli Sea Link amply demonstrates the state of project delivery system in the country. What was planned as a Rs 300 Crore project to be completed by 2004 has actually cost Rs 1,600 crore along with a delay of five years. Indeed, very few projects get delivered in time and on cost. More importantly India is set to shell out an additional Rs. 1,24,000/- crore due to delays in project.

1 0 Need to make adhaar card more stronger by adding additional details (Job history, eduction history, PAN, Passport etc.) Such details can be provide by University and Offices or Companies to Government so they can update these all details. Can make more effective to track the data of the indian and NRI's. 
1 0 In my view, a special part of social media marketing, content marketing, email marketing,  basics of SEO, SEM, google adwords, google analytics, google ads campaign, should also be provided so that they can get  basics of online marketing. 
1 0 My suggestion on national security. As everybody knows that we don't have single identification number which can track all our records (Address,Education,Job history, PAN, Passport, ID and other Proof) even in addhar Card we don't have education & jobs data. if anyone commit crime in xyz location its really hard to find the details of the person so india needs one identification number for all citizen.

2 0 The once strong Indian handicraft industry can be given a boost if Govt can provide a platform to market their products in the global market.Foreign  tourists are always attracted by our handicrafts. So if there is a provision for them to buy such things without a visit then it will be beneficial to our producers. Delivery can be done through postal department with a collaboration with International postal union.We should make use of our heritage services according to needs of modern age. 
1 0 Digital marketing course should contain necessary basic topics about computer and internet usage. This facility should reach every citizen irrespective of  his educational qualification.

0 0 It should be better if Government itself starts a portal market the products of small industries. Linking postal department for good deliverance of these products can also be utilized. First of all common rural people should be convinced by this new generation marketing and for that Govt help is necessary. If this scheme is working Govt can urge them to make separate portals and market their products of their own. So computer education should be promoted.

0 0 Strange! Indians have just proved how good they are in e-commerce & have attracted huge investments! Pl. approach them to not frame content of course but also to lead in administering and evaluating any such e-commerce course.

0 0 In continuation to my earlier Post I fail to see the topic of digital marketing strategy in the course content. Such a course  should be concluded with a case study where the trainees are led through the whole phase of digital marketing. It will be very instructive indeed. Moreover, a dictionary containing computer terminology in English as well as various Indian languages should be prepared and  distributed at such courses.The terms should be explained in simple manner. 
0 0 Section on Introduction to internet should in addition to others also contain 1) "How to create a Website" and 2) and " How to create a blog and other content". Furthermore I think that practical hours in this section should be increased to around 8 since digital marketing relies on the use on the use of internet.  Perhaps a simple test at the end of this very section will help to see if the trainees really understand the basics of internet.

1 0 my village name: khambhali, plz help of my village school building devlopment 
0 0 sir we have to start all the education by computer of some other like gadgets then it will also help to country by pollution  and give digital education to us. 
0 0 Sir a man who knows to use computer can use internet and hence Can do any online transaction so the need of the hour is to Go for Digital India first..then only this will be taske place. 
0 0 Good idea start an MBA in it, but problem lies with HRD ministries and universities they take 3 years granting approval by that time golden bird will be lost. 
1 0 For Rural population, literacy in computer start with Basic Games, then it should start with Google search for their Village road, if one start from one Village to another Village,how much time it take, very basic to create awareness among rural population and slowly to some constructive knowledge in Computers, instead of teaching Computers as is available in Urban area. Uneven in City, computers became popular with basic Games and end up in deep knowledge thr.Google.... 
1 0 It is good idea but problem is that for example a weaver buy or source raw material on credit basis from local sellers/financer with some condition like buy back all finished product therefore the proposed course content or govt. web site should also elaborate list or govt. approved sellers of specific raw material in each districts/town with information of price, subsidy, loan facility etc. so that each individual craftsman could not be made bondage by financier, middleman. 
1 0 In india still many villages school has not reached and wherever reached the standard still question mark.We must concentrate on basic education system, quality and effectiveness.Digital marketing will grow automatically. But still I suggest this kind of course can be applied into schools and colleges from 8th std onwards so that they will grow like entrepreneurs by doing part-time jobs.To implement these courses Govt. should take private partners with effective feedback system. 
1 0 I think course content is incomplete. Nielit must add spoken english, english typing & hindi typing because most of rural students don't understand english and otherside most of work of computer is in english only. If Nielit add these content students will be able for job. Course will helps these students to improve their life standards by getting a suitable job. 
2 0 This has to be voice recording for the non literates and the pages has to open on the mobile screen, like railway inquiry 
0 1 The NIELT Digital Marketing tries to include too much in one course. Instead of starting with 'Intro to computers" and intro to word processing and excel, a basic level of computer literacy including internet access to browse websites, email account, etc., should be made a pre-requisite. Rest of the digital marketing concepts need more than the alotted time to be comprehensive and  useful in a profitable way. May be only 1 or 2 sites, like Amazon and Ebay should be concentrated on instead of all

1 0 To implement the digital India in the rural area it is big challenges to capacity building of the rural people with respect to the use of communication and information technology. Most of the application websites are developed in English (like e-trading, e-commerce, e-banking, e-education and govt. website are also in English) all such websites must be redesigned in bilingual/regional language. The basic computer training material/ course designed in regional langues. Also try to develop the in 
1 0 Most of the older generation and rural people does not use technology due to a language barrier. most software is used by other Indians in English and hence participating for non-English speakers is hard. WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE USE OF APP DEVELOPMENT IN REGIONAL LANGUAGES. Also, we should teach everyone to use INSCRIPT KEYBOARDS with which one can type in most Indian languages without knowing the script and/or push for phonetic input on social media for people only using qwerty keyboards. 
0 0 Dear sir, availability of e  marketing should b based in app. Formet. And I'm interested to do for my village.With heart. 8896472960 
0 0 Pool in people who stick posters or distribute pamphlets and ask them to advertise along with these people. Ask them to share the cost of advertising ensure that all types of services like  movies shows, other events, schedule of bus routes, and other nearby locality maps are all present in the website along with the products they are selling through e-commerce. 
1 0 please add this contain all language- 1-how its works? 2-how to sale aggriculture prodoct online in all over world 3- how to broadcost all product in all language 4- how to use single person digital marketing. 
0 0 curriculum for digital marketing course 1.html 2.java 3.internet banking 4.internet security 5.animation module -maya 6.e commerce 7.courier and logistics 8.practicals :web designing 
1 0 Course should contain - 1. How E-commerce works - we can explain the concepts of elimination of mediator from supply chain. 2. E-Commerce benefits in individual daily Life. - Can analyze  market from Computer itself for anything by comparing the various sites/products etc. 
0 1 You should accept that target people e.g. craftsman, are not having enough skills to acquire IT knowledge ( Due to language, complexity in operation, supply of power, internet connectivity etc) it would be rather better if they concentrate more in their area of work to produce better and affordable products and it would be better if you target those who are operating Jan seva center etc for such training to get your objective done. 
0 0 Add a module on "Effective communication and presentation". Add tests and exams after end of every module. 
0 0 The objective is good. The content should be written in a very simple language with translations available in local languages. The emphasis should be 'Learning by Practice'. This means that the course should be mostly practical oriented. More than the course content, the sincerity in implementation is of paramount importance. We have seen in the past that many such government schemes become a means of swindling the government funds with hardly any benefits reaching the target audience. 
1 0 The course should also contain topic on the rights of the customer. Also very important is the governing laws on digital marketing. Some countries are very specific on mass emailing campaigns. One need to understand the law of the country, else has to face legal challenge. 
0 0 1. e-commerce concepts 2. How to initiate e-commerce. 3. Processes involve in e-commerce. 4. Role of Digital Marketing in e-commerce. 5. Sources of Digital Marketing - Portal based, Social Media based, Mobile based. 6. SWOT analysis of each source of Digitial marketing including the cost involved. 7. Frequency of digital marketing upgradations. 
0 1 The course should be in English language so they can refer to text from global websites. If someone registers in group then it should be free of cost. It will encourage more people to join. 
0 0 In our India already the public libraries are setuped all over india, So people of our country can make use of such libraries, and response of people is also good, They come to libraries and read the books news papers etc. So I think first the people should have computer operating knoweledge, this is possible by setuping the public computer training centers all over india, So people come and lean the basic computer operating knowledge to the centers. 
1 0 Course should in state language with simple experience. 
0 0 Required for microsoft certificate exams as lowest price by government which is really helpful for all the students who wants to make career in COMPUTER field. Thank you. 
1 0 first make them literate to read write and speak simple english, hindi and their mother tongue. they are struggling to earn a livelihood. once the basics at least the communication than the digital tools will be helpful. 
0 0 Please feel free to use my study guide - http://www.learnxpress.com/computer-fundamentals.html 
1 0 Required a University for the Designers like (Website Designers, Auto cad designers, Fashion designers) Because industry required these profiles in bulk to improve digital india 
1 0 Fundamental Computer education & e-commerce plattform be in his regional language. If Contents of website will be in regional language so, it will be easy for learn. 
0 0 Success in teaching comes by catching young minds. Design a course for teaching Digital Marketing as an important section within the subject known as 'Science' for students of 9th class onwards in all schools. 
0 0 There should be framework created by center with guidelines and the contents part will be handled by local clusters depending upon their needs 
1 0 The things are targeted should be in regional languages 
0 0 Experiential Learning will happen only when they have electronic gadgets on hand.  For every participant, consider providing Tablet Pc with Internet connectivity. Every serious B2B sites require cumbersome registration procedure. Educate them to fulfill the registration process.  How to capture their innovative products using Digital Camera, convert them into optimal size and educate them to upload the images, educate them to write a few words about their creativity would help them promote. 
2 0 Before we talk on educating rural india on digital marketing, ecommerce, firstly we need to think about on which languages still large population of india is not comfortable in english rather interested in getting explanations in their own languages. however, it becomes very important to focus either on content on local languages or in one indian language (could be hindi) then comes the educating exercise and the best medium is to replicate pm's discussion on chai formulla with mutimedia form 
1 0 i think the content should be in regional language so that it could be also beneficial to youth from rural and village background . 
1 0 In Today's world of Digital Marketing , the main core area is Internet security. People who are aware about the computer security are more comfortable on Internet marketing & shopping. So my suggestion would be more awareness about safe payment techniques & integrate Rupee Debit Card of Jan Dhan Yojna for direct Payment. The next big thing is target customer i.e SEO (Search Engine Optimization) , the power of basic search enable us to reach the target. 
1 0 I HAVE SMALL IDEA THAT IS "INTIALLY ALL YOUNG OR CHILDRENS WHO ARE CURRENTLY DOING THEIR EDUCATION FROM RURAL AREAS MUST BE SELECTED FROM EACH FAMILY , THEN THEY MUST PROVIDED WITH DIGITAL MARKETING COURSE"FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD ,& THEY MUST INSTRUCTED TEACH THE COURSE TO THEIR FAMILY, THIS WILL MAKE SOME AWARENESS AMONG THEM ABOUT E-COMMERCE SITES ,OTHERWISE THIS COURSE CAN BE TAUGHT TO INDIVIDUALS SIMPLY BY PROVIDING A AWARENESS PROGRAM IN EACH STREET OF A PARTICULAR VILLAGE.

1 0 Governance - Treat and make Indian Administrative Service as Indian Management Service; IAS into IMS. Each IAS must be evaluated on the basis or their managerial capabilities - ability to solve problems. Rules, power to make decisions, responsibilities and accountability must be defined. These must be made public. Their roles vis-a-vis MLAs and MPs must be defined. Make all this public. IMS must be accountable for development in their ministries. Same must be done with Indian Police.

1 0 Part X-Task force from NTPC, BHEL, CEA must be constituted to find solutions for technical, life cycle problems faced from 67,500 MW Chinese Power Plants that would be installed in India by 2016 Government of India should enforce contractual obligation from Chinese equipment suppliers on service facilities and spares manufacture, availability. Immediate, life cycle cost performance audit through CAG with assist from NTPC, BHEL, CEA experts required to fix accountability, responsibility. 
0 0 Part IX Chinese Power Plants manufacturers promised to establish manufacturing facilities for ensuring; ready, immediate availability of insurance spares, routine maintenance spares, annual maintenance spares and breakdown maintenance spares; no such manufacturing facility established or functional so far; private sector, public sector state electricity boards, lending institutions, failed to carry out FRONT END APPRAISAL and DUE DILIGENCE before ordering and installing Chinese Power Plants. 
0 0 Part VIII Chinese Plants need imported coal for BHEL PLF standards; result 125 Mn Ton Coal import (22-12-2014) cost @Rs.US$10 Bn (Rs.62,500Crs) foreign exchange outgo, 40 years lifecycle coal import cost (NPV) US $400 Bn (Rs.25 Lakh Crs); Chinese equipments cannot operate on Indian Coal or blend with imported, coal (20%); BHEL equipments capable on both counts. India 180 Mn Ton coal import, rail port logistics capacity saturated. Additional 125 Mn Ton capacity cost US $10Bn (Rs.62,500Crs). 
0 0 Part VII Economic life cycle costs impact on Indian Economy from 67,500 MW Chinese equipments; capital cost loss due to 19.4% differential performance viz-a-viz average BHEL equipment consequent operational de-rating of installed capacity; 13,095 MW @Rs.6Crs/MW Rs.78,570Crs; annual recurring production loss for 40 years life span at 6.5 Million units@Rs.5/KWH, Rs.13,61,880Crs; total prospective loss impact Rs.14,40,450Crs; national loss responsibility accountability must be established. 
0 0 Part VI None of Chinese Power Plants can operate with Indian Coal beyond PLF 57.2%, minimum operation PLF 67.5% necessary to service debts, return of principle. At 20% equity, 80% debt for Power Projects, serious non performing debt outstanding exists today for all those who loaned and invested from Public Sector, Private Sector Banks, Financial Institutions on Chinese Power Plants within India. Consequent non-performing assets in Banking Sector is Rs.3.5Lakh Crs unless Coal Imports are done. 
1 0 Part V Chinese equipments performance are lower than that of BHEL by; PLF – 34%, operating heat rate – 7.8%, operating hours – 8.5%, downtime – 43.4%, productivity – 7.6%. Specific liquid fuel consumption were higher by 100%. Absence of Operational safety features Turbine Stress Evaluator, Auto Timeline Run Up Systems; automation control systems compromised Global safety standards, could cause human error mishaps, grossly violated CEA mandatory provisions technical operational standards. 
0 0 Part-IV Ministry of Power ignored CEA 2008 report; failed to cross check and step back from the track record unsatisfactory performance of earlier imported Chinese Power Plants and their failure to perform in rest of the world. The CEA performance audit May 2013 comparative performance of BHEL, Chinese equipments revealed failure on Indian Coal and serious defaults on Chinese Power Plants 24,000 MW already installed and operating within India and 42,000 MW that would be commissioned by end 2016. 
0 0 Part-III CEA Statutory Authority determining Power Plant Standards of manufacture and performance on commissioning; reported vide first report of Sept.2008 that Chinese Power Plants were not to the design standards determined by CEA or to Global Standards. Chinese Power Plants had delayed deliveries, frequent break downs; Prima-Face would not operate on Indian Coal, serious contractual defaults existed that could cause life cycle costs effectiveness on productivity and cost effective tariff. 
0 0 Part-II BHEL one of India’s Global Standard Navaratnas has capacity to produce 20,000 MW/annum; along with NTPC, DRDO and ISRO were centres of excellence which has made India proud. BHEL installations constitute 67% of Coal Fired Thermal Power Plants; have performed with merit, credit and at National Thermal Power Corporation achieved commendable average of 82% PLF. For 10 years (2004-2014) BHEL was starved of orders; 67,500 MW defective Chinese Power Plants imports at US$67.5 Bn were done. 
0 0 Part-I The National objective for MAKE IN INDIA prime mover is power availability and with reasonable affordable tariff comparable with China which today is the manufacturing capital and hub of the world. In 2014 Thermal Power Plants (Coal) is 1,48,478 MW and in 2016 it would be 1,70,000 MW. Manufacture Industry needs 24/7 Power without break; the backbone of power is Coal Fired Thermal Power Plants since alternative Nuclear Power Plants constitute only around 5% of installed capacity in India. 
1 0 In my opinion to make India a superpower, we have to develop in all fronts.. First  and fore-most is to make India a economic superpower. For this declare two/three years ban on all disputed issues. We have to strive hard for improving our production in agriculture and make in India slogan a reality by make India a manufacturing hub for pin to aeroplanes just like china. We have to surpass our GDP growth for more than 10%. All these can be achieved only in a peaceful situation. Try for it. 
2 0 SUGGESTING ANY THING IS MEANINGLESS BECAUSE I AM DOING THIS WHEN MY GOV/SOME GOV IS STARTED . 
0 0 It's better to create the HAND in place of cutting the HAND. It's a request not a suggestion............... 
0 0 As we know that a proverb,"TOO MUCH OF ANALYSIS BECOMES PARALYSIS ".Same will happen if these type of courses introduced.Already millions of highly educated degrees are in dustbin of UNEMPLOYMENT. 
1 0 Respected Hon'ble PM,SUGGESTIONS FOR CREATING CREATION OF CONTENT FOR DIGITAL MARKETING COURSE IN USING E-COMMERCE SITE ARE TO PROCESS OF PRACTICALKNOWLEDGE ,SELECTING PROCESS OF ALL STUDENTS TO GETTING REQUIRED SERVICES ARE TOTALY BASED ON PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE NOT ONLY TO TAKE SCHEDULED KNOWLEDGE BUT SOMETHING MORE MUST BE ACHIEVED. 
1 1 Selecting process of all engineering student to getting job is totaly based on practical knowledge not only  to take books knowledge Every student will prepare to making one technical thing that can make the gorup of every intelligent student in there technical field 
1 0 A setback to the whole program is the lack of connectivity. If we talk rural India, we are talking about villages without proper electricity. The best possible internet connectivity to such villages is 2G network served by the telecom operator. You need to get Google Fiber to India and distribute it using meshed network. This will ensure 1.2 bn people receive internet. Get the ecommerce giants to sponsor a rural awareness campaign. Ask corporates to sponsor trainings and then recruit from there. 
1 0 College should start initiative to send their engineering students in remote village as part of their summer internship for at lease 5 days of their BE/Btech course.In these 5 days they will give demo about what is laptop/computer,demo of internet.FB,whatsup.Also they can give information how they can get internet connection,internet service provider, charges etc.Also 1 day seminar with parents and children so both should get some feel about internet.Also local internet provider can give demo. 
2 0 First step towards Surajya should be effective administration at village/town and cities level. Local administration should be empowered and held accountable, performance review and work progress reviews should happen for the their tasks and duties.  Public should have the effective mechanism for their grievances and their addressal. Government help line numbers should be setup for corruption complaints at each city/town level. 
1 0 Technology is common in nowadays to develop our country all Indian should have minimum knowledge about technology.. All basic content to use the technology should be taught to all it motivates to know more about.how mobilephones covered india soon india will be full utilisation of Internet technology. 
0 1 Every individual have AADAR card and than Govt setup a program to load all Assets of Individual. So that find out who is come under the Tax. One way of income of Govt. 
1 0 Cottage techno hubs should be promoted for manufacturing cheap mobile phones and other accessories.This would help to prevent the growth of chinese products in markets.It would be great help for our techni youths for jobs and a great boost to make in India project. 
1 0 Gov. should start the manufacturing of electronic items so that the effect of chin on the Indian economy diminish, the common people want to do that but having not a initial capital or knowledge he can't do so. if Gov. start this program with a good spirit give result as employment creation, economical growth and capital saving etc 
1 0 It is very easy to save atleast 1 Unit or 1/2 unit ( 1Kwh) of electricty for every citizen in India, Thus we can save Crores of units / day. We observe many places street light are glowing in day times, In railway compartments, in Govt offices. If we can save only one unit of electricity, we can bring energy revolution. We should commit to avoid Energy waistage. Appliying Timers for street light to avoid humen on off control. Also we can use auto timers where not accessiblity to operate switches 
1 0 Save Soul of Make in India!! It is very much painful to see captive power blocks are discriminated and separated from regulated tariff power plants. Odisha has several captive power plants whose coal blocks are cancelled, and in auctioning list, only one block is kept for them. All the large blocks are kept for power sector which disqualifies captive power plants for bid for such blocks! Polify Anatoly needs immediate correction dear PM! Only with competitive power India can be a global winner! 
0 0 Now India got a excellent prime minister Modiji who gave swachh Bharath,surajya movement,mann ki baat and clean ganga and so on.we the people of india give support to him to do more .I hope he may save National small savings and give all citizens may insured .Thanks 
1 0 We should a public e-commerce site operated by gov. The purpose of this site will be promoting products from area's of nation,including rural and urban. Government can provide free web space to them, as well as can utilise indian post service for product deliver. This site will be a public e-commerce portal as same as flipkart or Amazon. 
0 0 Acceptabilty and future prospects of the course should be brought out sequentially 
1 1 There should be an official website like PUBLICBOOK(alike to facebook) 
0 0 Contents can also include demonstration on usage, misusages, some case studies,examples 
0 0 Contents to include Definition,types,classification,usage of digital marketing 
1 0 Modiji Syllabus include knowledge about regional agriculture like cultivation stage, harvest period etc, production of value added products, export rules, preservation techniques etc. Utilisation of computer and mobile for e-marketing etc. Training should be given to local farmers, their children etc. Others should produce a bond to work among the local farmers for at least 3 years. 
1 0 My suggestion is to make idea book for new invention, techinicial modification, new development in any field. These idea book is as same as face book ( e-book ). From these idea book any one can upload ideas, any any one can see ideas. From these we can develop our country in better way. 
3 0 लम्बे-चौड़े वादे करने वाली सरकारों को देखना यह भी होगा कि आंकड़ों में महंगाई दर घटने का असर आम आदमी की जिंदगी पर क्यों नहीं होता? मंत्री-अधिकारियों को चंद बड़े व्यापारियों के हितों पर ध्यान देने की बजाय आम आदमी के बारे में सोचना चाहिए। बात सट्टेबाजी की हो या जमाखोरी-मुनाफाखोरी की सख्त कदम उठाने से परहेज नहीं होना चाहिए। चंद लोगों को नाराज करके करोड़ों लोगों को फायदा पहुंचाने में सरकार को भला क्या नुकसान हो सकता है? - 
2 0 वही 2012 में 30 हजार तक पहुंच गए। साल 2013 में 12 हजार तक आने के बाद ये भाव अब 4400 रूपए चल रहे हैं। भावों में आए उछाल का फायदा किसान की जेब में जाने की बजाय चंद बड़े व्यापारियों की जेब में पहुंच गया। ऎसा क्यों हुआ इसका जवाब देने वाला कोई नजर नहीं आता। ग्वार ही नहीं धनिया हो, जीरा या मैथी अथवा दूसरे जिन्स, सब जगह ऎसा ही खेल खेला जाता है। सरकार की मंशा यदि वाकई किसान को फसल का उचित मूल्य दिलाने की है तो इसे सट्टेबाजी से आजाद कराना होगा। 
1 0 साल 2013 में ग्वार को वायदा कारोबार से हटा दिया गया था। यही सोचकर कि सट्टेबाजी के कारण इनके भावों में आने वाले उतार-चढ़ाव का सीधा नुकसान किसान को होता है और चंद लोग भारी मुनाफा कूटते हैं लेकिन 2014 में इसे फिर शुरू कर दिया और वह भी कारण बताए बिना। पिछले चार साल के ग्वार उत्पादन पर नजर डाली जाए तो देश में यह 15 से 18 लाख टन के बीच स्थिर है। ग्वार का निर्यात भी चार से छह लाख टन के बीच बना हुआ है। यानी ना उत्पादन घटा और न मांगें बढ़ी, बावजूद इसके 2011 में जिस ग्वार के भाव ढाई हजार रूपए क्विंटल थे.. 
1 0 की मौज ही मौज है। टेक्नोलॉजी इन्फॉरमेशन फॉर कास्टिंग एवं एसेसमेंट काउंसिल (टीफैक) इन दिनों ग्वार और ग्वारगम की कीमतों में उतार-चढ़ाव का पता लगाने में जुटी है। सरकार का मानना है कि ग्वार और ग्वारगम को सट्टेबाजी से मुक्त कराने के लिए इन्हें एनसीडीईएक्स से बाहर किया जाना चाहिए। 
1 0 जनता लुटे तो लुटती रहे, किसान बर्बाद होकर आत्महत्या करते हंै तो करते रहें लेेकिन देश में रूपए को सोने के भाव बेचने की कला के पारखी तो चांदी ही काटते रहेंगे। पेट्रोल-डीजल के दाम लगातार घट रहे हैं लेकिन रोजमर्रा की चीजों के दाम घटते नजर नहीं आ रहे। सरकारी आंकड़ों में महंगाई दर गिर रही है लेकिन जनता की जेब पर इसका असर नहीं पड़ रहा। कारण सीधा और सपाट है जो सबके समझ में आने के बावजूद हर दौर में यूं ही चल रहा है। मेहनत करने वाले किसान और आम जनता भले परेशान होती रहे लेकिन बिचौलिए और मुनाफाखोरों की....

Of-course, opposition is there, but can't it be overcome by CENTRE taking over the powers to say, 1. Where it wants FDI- RETAILERS must limit operations to bring in vital FDI and kick-start investments? 2. Can't CENTRE define rules, say, 50 % to go into "IDENTIFIED Infra"& only rest to go for retail-outlets? 3. Can't CENTRE define a REGULATOR, under relevant Ministry?

0 0 As we are giving more emphasis on opening a saving bank account in the bank with the help of aadhar card. The govt should also instruct the bank for doing e-kyc for a loan account and linking that aadhar card with loan a/c by which a person will not be able take many loans from many banks and making them NPA. It will give clarity to bank to choose the right customer for loaning

1 0 Labour Ministry should work on this proposition if such option can be provided by the companies to their employees. Currently most MNC operating in India have 5 days work system and i have the same. But what i am looking at is the impact it is going to be huge, good for the government and better for the citizens of India. 5 DAY WORK . Mr Prime Minister this seems basic, but worth giving it a thought! 
1 0 Respected Mr Prime Minister, since we are looking at transforming ourselves into a global resource hub similar to emerged countries can we adopt some of their work traits which is basic but the impact is gigantic.What i am talking about is a 5 day working week for all, rather than working for 8 hours if an option is provided to 9 or 10 hrs a day with sat & sun off it would do wonders for the individual and to his/hers whole family.More time with family, will reduce stress and improve productive

1 0 DHARMA : This word is derived from root ' DHARI' It can be compared to mother earth bearing whole world. It could be an interesting question that what is the Dharma of a living being? Lord in his divine song ' Geeta' has made it clear that ' EVERY THING IS STUCK IN ME AS PEARLS IN STRING' Also at one of the places Lord says 'I AM CONSIOUSNESS IN EVERY LIVING BEING'. So the order in the form of consciousness is the one and only DHARMA of every living being. 
2 0 Nightmare of families of raped and rapists: If people of a country like India suffers such tragedies then it is sure that the family unit of society and educational system has failed in perform the expected. Is there some thing which both are lacking? Yes. It is the practice of seeing BRAHMA and his glory in all manifested. Aadi Guru Shankar described it as BRAHAMACHARYA. So why our ancient system of education was  known as Brahmacharya Ashram. 
1 0 Religion Conversion Issue: Religion change under force is WRONG but if willingly done then it can't be denied. Q is how to decide willingness or unwillingness in such matter? Evolve a procedure to change religion ONLY in presence of Registrar/Specially appointed magistrate.  Necessary bill/Law can be passed by seeking/inviting two third majority in support of it. 
1 0 I want to share my views on the status of petrol pumps (RO) in India.Most  RO located in rural areas are selling total volume below 100kl per month. Volume mix is Petrol:Diesel:: 1:2.25. Comission is approximately Rs 2 and Rs 1.2 respectively for peril and diesel. This way they are unable to to get 5% return on investment. Bottomed international crude prices may be used as an opportunity to revive this trade by increasing dealers commission minimum Rs 1 per liter on both products. 
1 0 I want to draw attention of Gov authorities on continuous rise in height of roads resulting into ultimate damage of a family unit capital due to periodic provisioning requirement for elevation etc of house.

The scrape may be used as filer for any immediate vicinity roadun.

One more views should also be there, Company Act should be made such that            after three or four years, the company should provide  minimum 5% to 6% of Dividend to the Investors other than the Infrastructure Company  COMPULSORY.

Management of NPAs.: This is an important area which requires constant attention and monitoring. This area is not given due importance. Most of the NPAs arise on account of mistakes committed  at the time of sanction. Lack of proper follow-up of the advance is an area of serious concern. These areas require to be properly taken care-of. 
0 1 business development. In regard to sanction of advances, obtaining applications and conducting pre-sanction survey have to be done by the Branch staff only as follow-up of the advance would be methodical. Sanction can be done up to certain amount at Branch itself. High value advances necessarily should be dealt with at Controlling Office. Development of business both in garnering deposits and sanctioning advances should be vested with Branch as well as Controlling Office. Simultaneously (contd
