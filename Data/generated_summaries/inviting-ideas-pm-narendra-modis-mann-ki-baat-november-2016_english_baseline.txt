hello sir       for DIGITAL CASHLESS MONEY   i am giving one best idea.
Respected PM ji, my suggestion about the current demonetization issue is to increase the use of card money and the e-money is to provide an 0.5 percent tax waiver for whoever uses the card money or e-money.
dear p.m. please express your sorrow for those who lost their children, family members and close relatives due to demonetisation and please announce compensation and give punishment to the responsible people like hospitals who refuse to give treatment to them.
Please put expiry date on currency note 3 years on big notes(500, 2000) and 5 years on small notes(100, 50, 20, 10.... this will prevent people to stock currency notes at home or lockers and they start prefering to deposit money at banks...
