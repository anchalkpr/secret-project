0 0 According to my opinion, HTPA as an agency needs to be a coordination body amongst various law enforcement agencies, with a specially trained and empowered intelligence agency of its own, and an action agency to bring about the required coordination between these law enforcement bodies. Also, I feel that some organisation to deal with those corrupt officials, who obstruct constructive efforts due to their own vested interests. Such agencies need to be setup especially in trafficking hotspots. 
0 0 Human Trafficking...Police knows most places where the girls or children are bought from and where they are sold and for what purpose... ..the best thing i can suggest is.... To eradicate each and every person from the government who is not loyal and is corrupt... If at all u come across any such person... Just inform On this website... Lets leave it to Mr. Modi to Check the matter from there on...Once the government is in the hands of Youth, There will definitely be a change... 
2 0 Sir people know every illegal project/works running in their surrounding but they not informed our government and police officers the only reason is unfriendly behaviour of officer. So plz make a system like helpline number but caller id is not published and not told to any government officer. 
0 0 jashpur district is human trafficking area in chhattisgarh. need a special project in human trafficking in this area. जशपुर जिले छत्तीसगढ़ में मानव तस्करी क्षेत्र है। इस क्षेत्र में मानव तस्करी में एक विशेष परियोजना की जरूरत है। 
1 0 जांच एजेंसी में, गैरकानुनी काम के खिलाफ कार्यवाही करनेवाली एजेंसीओ को भी शामिल करना चाहीए , क्योंकी तस्करी कीए गए लोगो का इस्तमाल बहुत से गैरकानुनी काम में भी कीया जाता है । 
2 0 Human trafficking has taken an ugly shape. Driven by poverty girls are lured by known people with the promise of jobs in the city. But more often than not, they are sold to brothel. To prevent this every gram pranchyaet Pradhan must keep watch whenever dubious promise of jobs are offered. They can go only after proper enquiry. Incidents of gang rapes have also been reported. 
0 0 (Section: Defense) India should sent anti-ISIS suicidal commandos who will disguise themselves like a jihadi and join ISIS, and after reaching their training centers in Syria, will do mass-killing of ISIS activists in their camps sacrificing his life. Very high compensation should be provided for his family. No doubt, one commando will be able to kill dozens of ISIS terrorists when he gets a good chance. This system will also help to discourage the recruitment of ISIS from India. 
0 0 Sir, It is a shame that even in this age so many women and children are kidnapped and sold to prostitution and maimed. This is because of bad policing and virtually no punishment for offenders. The stringent provisions of Nirbhaya Act should be extended in such cases. In China such offenders are publicly executed. The punishment for touts and brothal-keepers should be equally severe. Kidnapping is far worse than rape. 
0 1 GPS devices are inserted into pet animals & helping to get them back on lost.Similarly DRDO Should develop nano scale life long working GPS devices which should be compulsory inserted into skin of under 18 & above 21 on their wish.This should be done only in selected GOVT hospital in strict supervision.Make sure none other can get detector device & removing technology.Ban use of this tech. by private people.Allow it for women going abroad for work,Eliminate Local people who try to break this. 
0 0 First of all the proposed institution should have exclusive powers to curtail the menace. Local PD is already overloaded with all sorts of crime and to tackle Human trafficking, which is a serious and heinous crime, HTPA should be made powerful enough for making any arrest, within a legal framework,if so the need arises. It should be an independent agency, like NCB, with enough resources and manpower. Female representation is must in the proposed agency to strike a balance in various situations. 
1 0 We all know, kids in the traffic signals are not begging for themselves, why can't we show commercials in multiplex, TV, Etc, to educate people not to entertain these kids by paying money, like we are doing for SMOKING and "JAGO GRAHAK JAGO", so that they can stop it automatically. If it's not possible for Police to track the actual culprit and make it STOP. It's a simple theory of Supply and Demand, if there is no demand, there will be less supply (Human Trafficking) 
0 0 A lot of discussion on one rank one pension are going on. This issue is pending for last 40 years because this demand is illegitimate and will create division among other Govt. employees and security personnel. Security personnel is less talented and educated compared with other Govt. staffs. Still because of their nature of service they get several facilities like cheap ration, housing, tax free purchase from canteen etc. This OROP demand is totally unjustified but can be accepted widows only 
0 0 मानव तस्करी रोकने की एजेंसी एचटीपीए में स्वयंसेवी संगठनों को भी शामिल किया जाना चाहिए। कई ऐसे संगठन हैं, जो महिलाओं व बच्चों के लिए काम करते हैं। एजेंसी में सरकारी अधिकारियों व स्वयंसेवी संगठनों के प्रतिनिधियों की संख्या आधी-आधी होनी चाहिए। यह एजेन्सी जिला, मण्डल, प्रदेश व राष्ट्रीय स्तर पर बनाई जानी चाहिए। 
0 0 -Prostitution and related activities—including pimping and patronizing or maintaining brothels—encourage the growth of modern-day slavery by providing a façade behind which traffickers for sexual exploitation operate. - According to a national study, production of pornography and Internet sex shows often rely on trafficked victims. Approximately one-third of the victims of prostitution in St. Paul, Minn., have been used in the production of pornography. 
0 0 -There are 116,000 requests for child pornography, and 56 percent of divorce cases involved one party having an obsessive interest in pornographic websites. - Do you think it’s okay that kids start watching porn from as early as the age of 6 and begin flirting on the Internet from the age of 8? - There are an estimated 600,000 to 800,000 children, women and men trafficked across international borders annually. Worldwide, there are nearly 2 million children in the commercial sex trade. 
0 0 1.) Porn. What is the first thought that comes to your mind when you hear this word? Guilt? Shame? Disgust? These are some of the most common reactions toward porn. But as much as we feel that way toward it, many of us are enslaved to porn. 2.) We have spent more money on porn and neglected to help 1.4 billion people who are suffering every day from poverty. 3.) Right now, 30,000 people are watching porn. A new porn video is produced every 39 minutes. 
0 0 I wanted to share my thoughts on the recent pornography ban in India. I welcome it. Its a disease. Wanted to share some facts related to this issue. These are from the west. I wanted to share this youtube video. This guy at the end claimed that God was his saviour. https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=402&v=NH8NIZ8bOWc 
0 0 Human trafficking topic must be included in universities course. 
0 0 Human trafficking can only be reduced with the help of technology as below. 1)	Make aadhaar card mandatory for everybody. 2)	If person is missing, police just need to mark hi aadhaar card for tracking. 3)	Make passage through Railway station/bus stands/airport/taxi/state border only after verifying aadhaar and biometric. It hardy take few seconds to reconcile with missing person’s aadhar card. 4)	Track and destroy the begging mafia abducting children for begging. 
0 0 Respected sir, There is solution for the people who travel on foot.There is need to develop a running Road.I mean to say the footpath are transformed into running road just like the running stairs in the Malls and Airports. it will help in eliminating the cost of General Public who travel by RIckshaw,Auto etc. 
0 0 Yesterday #NDTV had a news of around 70 kids traveling in late night train and tracked at Hyderabad railway station. There were around 10 men waiting outside the railway station claiming the kids are their relatives, POLICE did nothing to question them. After seeing last few days reporting on NDTV feel wrong providing feedback or suggestions here. I thing my suggestion for now is fix the exiting police. 
0 0 I want to see the Indian Cities and roads on par with advanced countries like US, UK and neat and clean looking Dubai in UAE. I found that the there is no open place adjuscent to roads exposing mud and open earth in these countries. The roads are layed till the footings of buildings. If any space is left, the same will be converted as a green lawn. No mud and earth is seen openly. Due to this dust will not flow along with wind polluting the surroundings. In India curruption is to be controlled. 
0 0 All brothels should be banned and  announce as crime. The women ( sex workers)  should be  given reservation ( center and state)  in all government service or adopted my MENREGA  scheme. 
0 0 Beggars, sex workers, household slave equivalents should be given tools to fight their exploiters. And most importantly the end users(read exploiters) and their business should be curbed completely. No child decides to be a sex worker they are all forced into these activities. The first step would be to cut the demand for such things and provide maximum punishment for their handlers. Everyone related to the trafficking business should be systematically eliminated. Time to walk the talk. 
0 0 Massive awareness campaign telling people the plight of a trafficked person. Toll free easy to remember helpline no. mandatorily saved in all sim cards. Citizen participation is most important. Citizens should be encouraged to inform the authorities if they see anything suspicious for instance a creepy old man travelling with his sedated daughter. The police should be sensitized to ensure that such crimes never go unpunished. 
0 0 Trafficking starts from children. Adolescents who arrive at major cities, in search of money or job or fooled by some traffickers and exploited. Children in the hands of beggars in many cities are also to be watched closely, as they are kidnapped and heavily sedated. Law enforcers need to be vigilant all the time on such issues. Close monitoring of railway stations, bus stations etc., will help to improve the situation. 
0 0 Golden words. Read fully to counter crime. https://suttacentral.net/en/mn54 
0 0 Also should be strictly monitored on the sex traders who trap young girls under the banner of ठ job ठ 
0 0 Human trafficking is possible mainly because of extreme poverty. Parents must guard their daughters particularly because many of them are lured to hotel/guest house with the promised of jobs. Parents and brothers must verify the identity of those who offer jobs. Many wicked persons commit crime because they believe they can get away by bribing the Police. Police reform is a must for India to develop. 
0 0 1. CCTV cameras 2. Use of drone surveillance 3. Faster judiciary - people in india do not fear of law because of slow judiciary. 4. Transparent adoption and orphanage centers. I assume its here that maximum trafficking might be happening. 5. Incentive and protection to informers. 
0 0 The structure of the HTPA should have 1.Data monitoring dept of previous solved and unsolved cases 2.Statistic comparing dept based on data 3.Chief Investigative team and its respective Informers 4.CCTV monitoring cell 5.joint dept of HTPA & Police for collective investigation 6.IT cell to monitor and check up with suspicious cell phone numbers 7.IT cell officers working or deployed in all telecom companies to sort of data of short term used numbers 8.Missed & Found app 9.Helpline cell 
0 0 Dear Sir, HTPA has to be a separate force like the ATS or STF. Officers and IT cell on all levels deployed to check issuance of SIM cards, documentation. And it also should Ban all sale of mobile phones which do not have IMEI number. CCTV cell should be formed with enough personnel to monitor the CCTV cams put up.The Police and local informers should be of good help in setting up the chief investigative team. A department that collects and monitors data of all previous solved and unsolved case 
0 0 I guess gov should open a new.agency. like c.b.I.and peloy those state where the ratio. is high or all states.this should be highly secure. and gov give them. every authority power which belongs to.H.t.judicially. they are able to. give punishment+high amount of money as a penalty..jail for 15years.according to constitution. a new act..which like.302or similar.. 
0 0 while designing the web based mobile app the simplicity and speed be main criteria for maximum participation from citizens in uploading the pics of vulnerable persons. the requirement of registration for persons loading pic of vulnerable person should not be there. I on seeing a vulnerable person/ child should able to upload the pic/details of the person/location without much of time, my mobile no. shall act as reference.....matching with missing persons be done by FACE DETECTION SOFTWARE. 
0 0 To prevent Human trafficking a web portal similar to Khoya Paya can act as boon. The methodology has to be simple and user friendly. The missing person details are to be uploaded by the family members directly or by law enforcement agencies. FACE DETECTION TECHNOLOGY  can be used to find such missing persons. The mobile users all over india be prodded to upload photo of persons whom they think as vulnerable in their city/locality. location & brief physical features be loaded on mobile app. 
0 0 The issue is of very serious nature, death penalty should be the real punishment for this Gang of criminal it will be the deterrent only .Trial & judgement must be faster 
0 0 it is big issue, it happened due to poverty or personal issue, if people get employment then it can become less,for finish we have to create some emergency no. for help like 456 which work anywhere, or aware every1 with surrounding and help them indirectly or directly. if children become strong and brave  then no1 can touch them 
0 0 Human Trafficking - the source originates from black money and extreme poverty. First tackle these two vital issues and their will be a drastic reduction in it. Just creating an agency to prevent this menace will not serve the purpose. 
0 0 there should be cam in the auto etc..so that when the person enters the auto a pic will be clicked and the pic will be directly send to the main office of all this..the pic wouldn't remain with the auto driver..with the time and date the pic will be send automatically. 
0 0 Women and girls are trafficked within the country for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced marriage especially in those areas where the sex ratio is highly skewed in favour of men.The women at every stage suffers but by taking just one strick step towards the people or the people who dont care about the feeling of other and for whom the only way of earning money is human trafficking. there should be cctv cameras in roads and outside every shops,hotel. 
0 0 Govt must keep a tab on people involved in running Spas / Massage Parlors / Dance Bars / Lodges which have a huge potential for flesh trade and where human trafficking can take place. 
0 0 The agency can collect information (like photographs) about the children begging in the streets of each area and maintain a database . Children missing from their home can be matched against this database. This could be helpful in rescue of such children. 
0 0 Government should dicriminalize prostitution so that human trafficking can be easily checked. It is like economic liberalisation reduced reduced black economy of india proved to be an economic boom for the country. 
1 0 Narendra Modi sir why don't you make a image database for missing children's & ask people to upload pics of street beggers with children's,that will help matching missing children pics with those of beggers carrying children's and help bringing back missing childs. 
0 0 I would like to propose very strategic plan to find out child who have been part of the human trafficking and/or missing/lost for whatever reason. I request active response in order to figure out whether the proposal required further enhancement or it's practically feasible enough to implement. Thanks, Ankit Kotak

0 0 The main problem in human trafficking is poor economic condition of that family or that person.Nowadays mobile phone can help us to prevent Human Trafficking in many ways.Mainly this trafficking doing via railway system so if we can give one anti human trafficking booth in each main railway station we can prevent it by 40%. 
0 0 I think legalization of prostitution will help in reducing this. Once it is legalized the dependence on middlemen will decrease and so will the crime and trafficking. It is one of the oldest professions in the world. And legalizing this will in fact help the poor people pursuing it be given a platform to share their plight without feeling ridiculed. 
0 0 India is also hub of international trafficker Nepalese girls to Middle East despite banned with the help of Airlines & Immigration Staff they are going easily by paying huge amount. government should look after this also. almost all the airports have these arrangements. 
0 0 human trafficking; say a person being carried away, if couples in park, driving learners don't showcase such attitude then it may prevent. One now then again one then again leads to experience and money created in this world lures. NGO's a place where I was in past for studying been through miserable things hell and recently was in one place even, 
0 0 Human misery has become personalized in India, there is no social cause or contribution by Indians. We are self centric and dare to cross an accident site without noticing the ebbing of life, we are cruel enough already, we would not show any interest in Human trafficking or we shall never show any empathy. Say a beggar on the street is always dressed down without even contributing anything towards their hunger. If we do not have a knee jerk Government who ever it may be, we can transform. 
0 0 Human trafficking is just a fall of one's nature.some people say it in different manner.some of them are so shameless that they say it is livelihood. Im urging modi to take direct action against all those who run this disaster in my country. If we humans( superior) than any other beings on earth feels unsafe about our sis,daughter,relatives,wife then it is too harsh to say that every soul is dead. Just one cure for this problem.direct action  = shoot to kill. Dont make it boring 
0 0 HTPA should not fail like Anti Corruption agency. HTPA must address the root of the problem. 
1 0 adoption  is  used  as  a  tool  by  child  traffickers . TRAFFICKER  knows  that  ADOPTING  does  not  arouse  immediate  suspicion , please  see  attachment  pdf  ,  P D F  ATTACHMENT , this  is  specially  true  in  bengal  where  a  number  of  incidents  have  been  reported  forcing  even  the  SUPREME  COURT  to  take  steps . children  trafficked  from  villages  of  WB  are  found  across  the  country , many  from  these  village  hav  gone  miss 
0 0 A web-portal should be developed where details of all missing persons are available. Entry can be done by only authorized persons like Police. Every citizen should be available to watch the portal and details. So whenever someone find any unknown person or missing he/she can check it on portal and contact police so person could be reach at respective place. 
0 0 Good morning sir, Strong ,punishble law require againts acused. police take charge on that. Start with finding by who,by where and by what this type activity Going on. Take action on it. Educate,give  food,service or job to affected person. So  othet victim can not catch up by them and supplier take huge penality and jail term so nobody start it. Thanks... 
0 0 Govt. is considering giving one rank one pension to armed forces. I am strongly against such decision to waste public tax payers money. If it is done for armed forces why not for other Govt. employees who are also giving more service to nation. Armed forces gets good salary, free ration, cheap items from canteen etc. during their service. After all these why again more pension for them in OROP, after all only lowly qualified persons join armed forces who cannot get any other employment. 
0 0 Sir 
0 0 sir,if a child on a street begs he should be enrolled in central and state government coed institutions where utmost care must be taken to educate them. government must stop doing everything else and just focus on education and infrastucture. if a parent cannnot take care of his child the child must be taken up by the state. no parent has right to abuse their child. if child labour is banned so should be begging by children. 
0 0 Why does children goes missing....One of the major reason is  Begging racket spread across all corners. Small kids r pickedup from their houses even and moved to some 100s kms away. Govt has started swatchta abhiyan for cleaning roads offices, spending millions. Why there shud not be anti begging campaign. Pick up all kids from city and create shelter homes or  child centres 
0 0 Dear sir, To stop terrorism spreading across, v should know our neighbours, owner should know their tenant, & landlord should be known by registrars. government should bring in a rule where in any landlord renting a property should do KYC, like without rental agreement he/she should not let out the property and should collect valid id and address proof. copy of rental agreement/id/address proof/ to the nearest police station with in the 10 days. same after agreement renewal also. 
0 0 1. Ban porn, prostitution and vulgarity in film industry. 2. Vulgar material must be controlled by hardware itself not by software. Such hardware must be developed. 3. Giving spiritual value education to children. 
0 0 Dear Sir, I am giving an idea to find missing children and human trafficking . This will help to find out the children in great way. Details about process is as follows. Make an special no which can connected with whatsAap -> This will be downloaded in mobile of all whatsaap user-> Connect this number with police station-> Police will upload photos and contact details of missing person- All user will download this. I already mailed this to Dr. Ravishankar on mail ID provided on site. 
0 0 Create a database of DNA profile of all the children begging on street and match it with the the DNA profile of the parents of missing children. The DNA test of parents of missing children need to be done at the time of writing FIR. This will help in knowing the genuine parents of children who are victims of human trafficking. 
0 0 May enquire how many industrial group are defaulters in repaying institutions loan though own assets are not touched. Recover outstanding loan from individual assets. Amend laws to do such recovery. Ask RBI for details of bad loans of big houses/groups. 
0 0 How much money we would requre to send most on VRS one may work out. I am sure it would be major overhaul to cleanse system.May recruit retired military personnel with good credentials for police job with reasonable salary as they would be drawing pension as well Please consider for better future if police force is good then society is good. Impartial newspaper is another pillar of good society. Then judiciary needs cleans up as well. 
0 0 British has best police but given us worst and we are continuing with that. Offer attractive V.R.S. and drive most and keep best available then recruit best possible giving them best possible pay structure and best possible working facilities all over India. To my estimation 95% must go.Pay whatever is necessary so that one can really think/dream of new BHARAT otherwise NOT POSSIBLE at all.Recruit qualified and give them proper training. We do not require huge numbers but quality police to do. 
0 0 Most of the beggars we see on daily basis may have been trafficked whether a child or adult. My Suggestions: 1.Create a department for beggars with offices in all cities. 2.Sole purpose of this department should be finding beggars and providing them with education if children and jobs if adults. This will also create employment due to the new department formed. Tracking down traffickers might be difficult but implementing this will remove at least one reason for trafficking.

0 0 Please make a special department with cooperation NGO, social workers, CID AND POLICE to track down human trafficking all over India. Prevention Agency special. JAI HIND.VANDE MATARAM. 
0 0 1. Redefine laws that we still follow. 2. Make law above all policy rather than parliament above all. Give complete power to National defense and Civil defense organizations to tackle such things. 3. Though the IPC sections are available, make is easily assessable to public. 4. Make the best use of UID cards. Link every thing to UID. 5. Being a citizen of it is also our duty to keep note of our surroundings. It's high time to change our system. 
0 0 1. Make a web site where we can upload snaps of beggars (child used in trafficking). 2. Microwave imaging to look inside large truck near Toll Plaza and National Highway. To prevent human trafficking. 3. Dual tracking and monitoring at road and Highways from two different agencies e.g. Army and NIA. 4. Add Prevention of Human Trafficking in Corporate Social Reform, and allow/support NGOs to work in these field. 
0 0 where ignorance, hunger, moreover lack of literacy ,education, strong family values, humanity, compassion and love, care, affection, concern for others pain and strain, value of human life, new opportunities for living----all these have become dangerous evils causing missing people, illegal human trafficking. Urgent need for people to get enlightened and avoid traps like these. 
0 0 It is mainly because of the taboo we have in the system. Even govt officials are afraid to talk about it when PM and Ministers don't even touch on the topic if forceful prostitution on young children. Govt should legalise prostitution, make sure everyone enjoys equal rights and protection(even prostitutes and their children). And punish people involving in human traficking. 
0 0 Human trafficking cases charge Non bailed sections... 
0 0 Use a trained person as  dummy that will get caught and will finally revel the bosses. To stop crime get criminals in your side. 
0 0 Start a hotline no. where people can inform the police if they suspect this type of activity. 
1 1 Being a lawyer I could say that To stop human trafficking by current Indian laws and police machinery is almost impossible ! But Definitely Govt could control it by adopting the PATTAYA- THAILAND MODEL. * Trafficking should be banned from Entire Country and harsh punishment is provided for that. * Trafficking should be ALLOWED to the specific notified areas of the country so that Govt could easily focus, monitor and control Social, Economical and Medical needs of sex workers. 
1 0 Police Personnel / Bus Drivers / Railway employees must be trained to look for such victims. They must ask for ID papers from the escorts. Due recognition should be awarded to people who crack such gangs. Human trafficking must become a non bailable crime. 
1 0 Is there any way or routine exercise to check the wandering children. 
0 0 Many labour inspectors who are supposed to save labour from improper conditions, exploitation instead take money and forget duties. It seems money is everything in this country. Inspector raj that PM spoke about is true. 
1 1 The one thing that irks the maximum with Civil Services in India is about its habit of demanding Permanent Address of the citizens in all its forms. The assumption that every Indian Citizen has some permanent address is grossly wrong. Citizens are therefore made to falsify some other address as their permanent address. Those like me who repeat my Present Address as Permanent Address but we change address often. Either scrap demanding PA or let Government provide Permanent Address to all. 
0 1 All the NGO will make awareness in school boys & girls, Culprit should be punish through first track COURT then only we can stop this. 
0 0 I believe that a strong and stringent law should be initiated to punish those involved in human traficcing. A nation whihc cannot cofront the miscreants who are ruining the honr of women for mere wealth egenration cannot stand as a nation enjoining Justice. And i believe as we pride ourselves in our values of justice, equality we should equally be stern in implementing it. We should build more awareness camps and put an end to all such evil activities. Immoral shows should be banned. 
0 0 We can only crack the whip for human traffickers by banning the prostitution completely in India. Because, I personally feel, the women in that hell are not the ambassadors of voyeurism and volunteerism for some sex miscreants'. So, the government should consider the rehabilitation for women and transgenders' community, whom have so far pushed into this industry. 
0 0 Strong action against this crime and most important awareness among family spaecailly in minor girls . Run a campaign frequently to make them aware of fraud being done in the name of promising a better job in the city. Let the NGO and governmnent organisation conduct an awareness programme among the family in rular areas .More awareness can combat this crime to an extent.Make this as a mandatory for NGO and Block offices. 
0 0 Attaching a letter as i can't type all that here due to limitations on number of words may be. 
1 0 Human trafficking is too much in West Bengal and bangladesh borders. Many womens everyday was trafficked in bangladesh and also same from that side in India. Action on this culprits must and put them in jail to save the women's pride and dignity in the country. Pimps should be nabbed and the groups should be exposed and action against them is must. 
0 0 Strong and confirm action against human trafficking crime, make it equally serious as murder is. jail for 20 years and fine of minimum 25lakhs only not upto. save the whistle blower seriously. 
0 0 Government will get cheap labour & these people will develop skills & get a head-start for a better future.These underpriviledged people will also get a sense of achievement & self-worth. Hence , a centralized way of donating for a good cause can curb beggary & therefore human trafficking. 
0 0 If the government can make this process transparent i.e. how exactly the money donated by Indian citizens is being used , people will be encouraged to donate more.In return ,Indian Government can provide rebate in taxes for money donated .There can be such hubs setup where Government will provide basic food & shelter to people who cant afford it .In turn government can co-ordinate with some NGOs to teach basic working skills to these people to earn livelihood. 
0 0 Similar to as our dear prime minister is asking for giving up subsidies on LPG, he can ask for supporting this noble cause of helping the underprivileged people of our country. I am quite sure that most of us are ready to donate if we are sure that the person is actually in need. Donators,in turn , should be able to ask for tax rebate. 
0 0 We can stop human trafficking if it becomes unprofitable for people involved in this crime. One of he major reasons for human trafficking is beggary. I have never seen a Sikh begging . If they can manage it in their religious community , I wonder why India as a nation cant make begging illegal. Instead government can provide support i.e. 2 times meal & if possible shelter. This can be done through Public -private partnership . 
0 0 First we need to control a population of India. For all the religion it should be implemented. all religion MAN might have two children only (whatever the no's of his marriage). 
0 0 In Mucknowpur village of Bihar, Trafficking of young girls is something very rampant.Recently. 4girls went missing. The people living in the village are reluctant to approach the police because they fear their societal reputations. Please do something :( 
0 0 please take measures to ban plastic its a huge problem in our country or try to make use of plastic,Increase the tax of plastic making companies.I will try to suggest my views regarding this.Make public aware of it.Please introduce a scheme that a cow for every home in a village so that we can also scrap upadi grammen yojana as there is not much use of it. 
0 0 Strict punishment on home owners emplying children. It is rampant practice.  The penality is nothing on such households. FEAR of law has to be there. Such punishments should be publicised on mainstream national media and dailies. 
0 0 Idea: There must be a reservation in Police Department for those who have a girl child; it may be 10%. It will encourage people to have girl child and they will take a girl as a good gift, instead of a liability. More over the father of a girl will be more and more sensitive against woman crime as a police personnel. It will help to curb crime against woman particularly- Female foeticide, Rape, Human Trafficking 
0 0 If we can develop rural area human trafficking will be reduced. 
0 0 We Should legalize prostitution. Women who are willing to into this business should be allowed to do so legally which will protect women who are force to do this. pimps should be banned. legalization will help prostitutes register themselves. will help the from scorns of police and freely allowing them to do so will help them free from pimps.since women willfully entering sex trade, will fill up the supply demand gap for paid sex and save women. these women then can pay tax n have legitimat life 
1 0 I have an idea to control the Rape Crime.. Please go through the page.. i have tried to explain.. http://socialarmyindia.blogspot.in/ 
0 0 National Hot line no. should be made so that women in distress who are in flesh trade caught against their are rescued. Some co-ordination should be done with Nepal also because reports says many women are brought form nepal and sold in mumbai 
0 0 for controlling human trafficking social networking site should put age limit and age limit should be verified by aadhar card no. it will help to protect growing generation and age limit to be put can be 16-18. no need to follow us norms as per facebook i.e 13 yrs. 
1 0 One officer in the week will arrest all beggars and find hes or her family and other beggars can transfers to other side government agencies (I.e. child has to be transferred to hostel and elders has to get job) and make advertizement for public interest for no any gifted to beggars because it is help to make lots of crime. 
0 0 Govt has strongly use Aadhar Card with finger  print and eye retina with every children and elder's to traveled abroad person and make one verification team to verify all house with finger print without notice to any body. every street, cross roads and public transport needs recording camera with time and date. 
0 0 Understaffing is the real cause with out nation the existing system with administration foolproof designed to locate the issue and the stage of deviation moved away from the procedure.... kindly improve the staffing process and procedure with out any further delay towards goals 
0 0 The more important issue is "Rape". Government need to focus on this timely needed issue. We are feeling shameful that we are not able to punish culprit. At same time we humiliate rape victim at every place. this must be stop. We need very stringent action in rape matter and action in defined timeline. Now people started punishing culprit. Don't encourage people to do so. Law and order is very important and for that quick action is very important. How can govt sit comfortably even minor abused? 
2 0 In Hyderabad recent rides our police and social workers rided somany places and identified thousneds  childrens saved from various industries as they working as a labour it showing how much  human trafficking going on in INDIA it is shame our part as a humanbieng . so pl do need full correction in law is nescissary.to prevent support from society and peple participation only give solutin to prevent evil thing. 
0 0 providing better chances and enhances the capabilities of the uncountables is the biggest challenge nation could have .It's one of the tuffest challenge to provide equal accessment to these uncountables .As we know that if we can ask and as we dont know we cant .Hence moral is why these uncountables still cant be make counted and get what they want .So why cant we make nation know about this trafficking issue why cant we make aware residents of the nation that human trafficking is an like terror 
0 0 Check this out. They're using DNA to tackle with human trafficking. https://scienceandsociety.duke.edu/dna-human-trafficking/ 
0 0 Sir, we should work on restricting the beggars. I feel this is the big issue on which we have to do work. If we can stop begging then it will support a lot to stop no of crimes. It's shows a bad image of our society.I feel it can also help on human trafficking. 
0 0 मानव तश्करी की शिकार बच्चियों के लिए ठोश नीति अब तक नहीं है ऐसी बच्चियां जिन्हे देह व्यापर के दल दल से बाहर निकला जाता है उनके पुनर्वाश और जीवकोपार्जन के लिए सरकार को कदम उठाना चाहिए ताकि आधी आबादी की जिंदगी को खुशहाल बनाया जा सके ? 
0 0 Using the detectives can be very helpful to solve this problem. We see beggars in all metropolitans and fares all around the country. Many of these beggars are children who have been forced into this. Look for the children begging at the signals. They must have a master there to supervise them. By catching their master or following the trails of the beggars secretively, many gangs running such secrets can be busted at the ground level itself. But rehabilitation of such children is must. 
0 0 There should be a special wing to swiftly act and catch such illegal activity. They should be a minimum of 5000 police force. 
0 0 First the investigators should visit brothels and find out, from where mass recruitment of girls are happening. Also involve Activists and volunteers to report such movements. Similarly in red light areas, more plain cloth police should be employed to catch suspects.If there is a will, it can be done. 
0 0 These days we are getting lot of messages on children being kidnapped. It is heard that the kidnappers group is of around 400. They are kidnapping to make the child beg in Kumbh mela is what the rumours say. CAN GOVT BAN CHILDREN BEGGING IN KUMBH MELA ITSELF? AS SOON AS A CHILD IS SEEN BEGGING, THEY SHOULD BE ARRESTED AND TAKEN TO REHAB. NOT ONLY FOR KUMBH MELA, BUT THIS CAN BE APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. Request the govt. to please save the innocent children. 
2 0 Formation of secret Force Like FBI(Federal Bureau of Investigation)and for All kind's of Government Departments and Organizations to raising believe in People. and Maintain very Secretly this Force give all rights to the Department this Force name is Black dot Investigation. 
0 0 govt have to give the full permission to resolve a case by the govt ! and we have to make a analysis for that . and have to make a strong law also sir ..! 
0 0 Most of the crimes in India are happening with the support of the local police. Please teach boys and girls in all schools, in case they find their friends missing, they should be able to contact a National mobile number in PM's office. They should verify the genuineness of the complaint and take action in the local area within a week. Human traffic is an organized activity. 
0 0 Sir ...we have to power up our enforcement agency.i.e.police department. Make law and order as superintendent of police subject in district rather than DM then we can easily concentrate our law..we also give some special powers to cyber crime dept. Bcz today world is digital.some special provisions for our internal security management makes lots of things easy to tackle such as maoists cyber attack etc. 
0 0 Agar Chor ka Pata chahiye to rakhavali karane walo ko pucho, isi tarah simply Human Trafficing problrm se ladhana he to pahile department se nipat lo, if corruption iside the department will end's automatically all this problem may stop..

0 0 Make Begging Legalize and Government Took all beggars  who specify following criteria like unable to do tasks (like very old persons etc.) Firstly beggars are known and uniquely identifying for caring them through proper  health and begging criteria set and Secondly Govt. can choose persons out of them to provide other earning tasks according to their capabilities and Lastly Who is responsible for their situation with details. -->for this Govt. in Parliament and All Media through discuss it 
0 0 People get trapped because they feel they can prosper only on a foreign land... Attraction towards western countries is so high that many times, this blind love make people fall in trap! So changing the basic attitude of the people, and make them believe that they can prosper on their homeland itself, will solve the major problem. Initiatives like Make In India will help bring change in the attitude. But at the same time we have to strengthen our vigilance, IB, and stop Human Traffickers! 
0 0 As a responsible Citizen of India I express my suggestion and ideas...JAI HIND. 
0 0 I have not gone to aboard but I have little knowledge that in western countries any type of  employment or labour appointed only through proper agencies but here we have many 420 agencies non registered agencies filling the paper advertisement or website.in the name of job,livelihood earning people are vicitimize. 
0 0 orghanages home ,other societies should be inspected.Domestic help in private house owner should be inspected. 
0 0 As a Responsible Indian Citizen my suggestion or ideas I placed.. JAI HIND 
0 0 In search of job,services,livelihood people are victimize in such  types of Anti Social elements like Human Trafficking etc. We should stop the easy money ways at first, Non Registered many Agency now a days we see in website.Conscious people of our society should take a stand together take action against them like False Consultanty Agency or Escort Angeny.A special team shud work together Govt,NGO,Social worker,CID,Police,Cyber department,Human Rights and Lawyer. 
1 0 In the name of social service and in disguise;many NGOs and orphanages do child trafficking with many vested interests.Recently a Kerala orphanage did child trafficking  from Bihar to a Madrassa in Kerala where there were many illegal and sexual abuse going on.Punish those not looking at them from minority or majority community with minimum 5 years hard imprisonment. 
0 0 sir legalise escort services and give sex workers their basic citizen rights because women who once come in this trade even if want to give some info are harassed by police and society, moreover seal the borders of nepal and bangladesh properly,extra vigilance must be taken for tribal girls or children of bpl families as police didnt file fir, the rackets of organ donation must be dealt strongly 
1 0 Human trafficking under the guise of orphanages and old age homes should also be verified. There are reports that many such institutions work for religious conversions getting money from overseas. There was a report in 1970s, while I was a student, that a charity organisation "rescued" a man on the streets but he was converted before his death thereby denying his right to die believing in his own religion. Even now many at prayer meetings say that they rescued a person by converting him/her.

0 0 Police, if loaded with dedication and firm commitment attitude, which is missing, will curb this to a great extent. 
0 0 Without police reform it is not possible to tackle the issue of human trafficking 
0 0 Our police force, the most visible sign of governance, is broken. How can India ever aspire to become more than developing country, if an Indian is worried each time he/she has to deal with the police.  There have been multiple studies into the modernisation of the Indian Police force, but the central government and every state government has failed its citizens, so much so that the central and state government have chosen to ignore directions of the Supreme Court of India on police reform. 
0 0 The root problem of this is poverty. This is true all over the world. If in five to ten years poverty is eliminated in all villages , especially those of say Jharkhand and maybe four other states where trafficking is rampant, this problem will simply go away. 
0 0 Edn is a mind-forming, socialisation-changing, culture creating, potent weapon of  building future society. Vision, imagination & post-bureaucratic model of management necessary. Autonomy begets creativity, motivation & freedom to use one`s  ideas. Control & command stifle talent,genius & the poten greatness of the nation.. Kindly free hundreds of academic,scientific institutions of this  scourge . As a former senior academic administrator, an ex-Chairman of an ICSSR institute,I believe 
0 0 There is a reason behind every crime so kindly focus on these like upmost unemployment... 
1 0 We should Make an International Institution in India, say banks for any Asian around the world, or asian security force, or asian security council, etc. Places best for such institutions:- Highly recommended- Makum (historically known as the meeting place visited by Afghanis British Chinese Thais) which is near Tinisukia, a future smart city Recommended:- Kolkata(have a lot of space) Bhopal Port Blair kavvarati Not much recommended but can be good:- Kaniyakumari Chandigargh Guwahati

0 0 To stop Human Trafficking give some more power to our Immigration Official at every exit/entry point/port of India  for introgation or verifying the identity of travelling passengers if he got any suspected passengers. As many other country administration gave power to his immigration to take action at the same time if they feel that such pax intention is not good in terms of national interest. I know that some rule are followed at our entry/exit port but make it more relevant at ground level. 
0 0 Human Trafficking mostly affects rural & poor human specially women & children.Traffickers use passages through metro cities, big rail stations, & interstate bus terminus , & for inter national trafficking international airport & international ports are used . so plain cloth vigilance in this area is required I.B. should be more active. informers of intelligence is a pivot point . human trafficking & terrorist--both category should get equal priority from concerned safety & security authority. 
0 0 Sir True Caller app in Playstore definitely challenges the privacy details of an person. IF u get a mob no of an person u can see even his photo, location Absolutely without his permission. It is an american based company developed this application. It is a big threat to our citizen's  privacy and national security. Immediately take effective steps against these culprits. 
1 0 1. Clean up the top bureaucratic set up in MHA by immediate replacement of tainted officials owing allegiance to the UPA regime.2. Monitor the anti-national activities by NGOs/Religious groups using foreign funds. 3.Bring in changes in laws making the offence of hawala/blackmoney/black marketing with capital punishment and automatic forfeiture of properties of offenders. Put the vigil on the anti national agents working as human rights activists. 
0 0 Very good step to stop human trafficking. Each and every citizen have responsibility in protecting our own people. So one call center number should be provided for agencies like IB, RAW, SIT, HTPA etc for timely communications information. Should give rewards for people who provide key information on threats to national security. 
0 0 Gandhiji, Sardar Patel, Nehruji, Vivekananda all have their identity by attire and its difficult to imagine these pesonalities in different attire. Likewise beloved Modiji is also identified by the attire of Modi kurta. Switching to pinstripe suit has resulted into total rejection in Delhi polls. Please consider course correction.

1 0 Organised structure required from national level, state level, city level, district level, etc with dotted linkes to DCPs in that regions. Some NGOs in coumpflaged manner working for getting funds paid for body shopping. Its scope is not restricted to domestic locations but over seas locations as well. Bigger colonies at different country take labour from domestic country without any legal paper work & migrate on visitors visas creating fraudulent mechanism of people as well as moeny 
1 0 I believe our law and monetary penalty not strong which is taken for granted by criminals. Have law so strong that sends a stern message to the criminals. Everyone is doing crime, some doing the tax theft, some doing the child trafficking, some making people fool and eating their money (Builders), and many more examples. In each case we see law is not strong,takes lot of time to punish the person. Why can’t first recruit in Judiciary who can take cases on priority and dispose it in a month or so

To over come this HUMAN TRAFFICKING police has to investigate dark areas of any city or state. They can investigate as a civilian in that or any particular area. As if they are bsy...then provide the power or manpower to investigate by the volunteers about these drug taking people which affects the many life's of the family. Activeness is necessary in every area.

0 0 The Market Rates for Rice are all time low but the prices for Rice grains have not fallen accordingly which is causing the Millers incur huge sets of losses. The Rice Industry are changing into NPA'S at an alarming rate recently. Further the Central Govt. has reduced its levy quota for procuring Rice due to which there is very less support for market prices. The Central Govt. must take this issue at an urgent basis and find out some solutions regarding it to let the industry survive. 
0 0 These agencies should work along with the existing institutes or trusts which are already focusing on mental health of students 
1 0 Human Trafficking will be reduced by spreading help desk number among cities. 
0 0 Rice Sector being one of the most important in west bengal has taken a great set back recently due to different policies of the govt. As per the harvest season Millers have to buy grains at MSP decided by the govt. without any deduction for khad. MSP rates being above Rs.100 than market rates is making millers incur huge losses. The farmers are benefitting less as the middlemen are the ones who are the big gainers. The behaviour of people has changed drastically unrul, forcing Millers to accept. 
0 0 Failure of public sector divestment (asking LIC to buy) - Reasons.

I have lost money wherever government is even remotely involved. No one wants to invest.

0 0 in the delhi elections kejriwal is going about saying that subsidy in LPG should be given to all and not only to BPL families. this way Rs. 100 will get shared by all and as a result the BPL will get only Rs. 10 instead of getting Rs. 100 fully to those who need the most.

0 0 What d heck is going on Government allow girls bar and red light areas controlled by Mafias and on ground other department fighting against humans trafficking. 
0 0 The authorities should stop playing hide n seek n stop turning a blind eye to this menace. In many cases police are hand in gloves with the conspirators but still prefer to be silent either in lure of kickbacks by way of cash or kind or due to political pressure if any. Special workshops should be held for general public to educate them about methods used by criminals and how to be an alert citizen.. Mere putting up posters and banners of being alert won't help until the basics are taught 
1 0 I request to Modi government that plz improve all the basic facilities to all common people. Today everyone wants to do government job but no one want go to government schools, hospitals. I could not understand why government is not improving these common thing and people are helpless and going to private. Today why education, hospital are source of business not seva. They are looting common people because government is not providing this basics thing. Why BJP not including it in development? 
1 0 I want government should stop advertising scheme and use that amount to improve process. I we nt my native place Bihar where LPG gas agency overcharging and if someone is raising voice they are not providing connection. If you are paying demand amount then there is no verification, no process and can get immediate connection. They are without any fear that no one can harm them. I tried to complaint then they crushed my mobile and spectacles broken. I want strong action against these type people.

2 0 I want inform to railway minister that caterer's in train are charging over amount on food items. I was travelling in Dec 14 in Yeswantpur-Mujafferpur and Tata- Yeswantpur found 50 Rs. Veg plate charging on 70 Rs that I validated after complaint and demanding menu card cum price list. Actually I ordered for lunch and found chapatti and water packet missing in veg plate package. I asked to caterer and he replied we give chapattis only on demand. I seen 15 rs water bottles charging 20 rs. 
0 0 Many of us are giving different suggestions . Is any one reading them for actionable points ( if any) or the ideas are getting lost in the plethora of messages .. 
0 0 Why is the limit of contributing of only to four groups given . We can always have idea for contribution to the other groups . I would have liked to contribute Green India . Why do we not allow  cheap electric vehicles . Few days ago I saw the Electric vehicle TOTO at Howrah, Westbengal . The vehicle can run more than 80 kms on a single charge   Why we cannot allow these to run on Indian cities ( http://www.totoindia.co/company-information.html ) 
1 2 To improve our educational and health care system, I suggest to make it compulsory for aal govt. Officials, ministers, MP & MLA to send their kids to govt school for education and use govt hospitals for healthcare. Automatically these systems will improve without investment of single penny. 
1 0 मोदी जी, दिल्ली लोकसभा चुनावों में BJP को केजरीवाल पर अधिक हमला करने से बचना चाहिए। BJP का focus अपने manifesto पर अधिक होना चाहिए। कही ऐसा न हो कि केजरीवाल को विरोध का लाभ मिले जैसा लोकसभा चुनावों में मोदी जी के साथ हुआ था। आखिर विरोध भी तो एक प्रचार ही है। जितना विरोध होता है उतना प्रचार भी तो हो रहा है और केजरीवाल का महत्व बढ़ता है। अति सभी की बुरी होती है। केजरीवाल को तो वैसे भी सस्ती लोकप्रियता अधिक पसंद है। ये लोग तो स्वयं को पिटवाकर भी सुर्ख़ियों में रहना जानते है।

0 0 Hon. PM, Shri Narendra Modi, needs to address the issue of "National Debt", which is growing at a rate faster than our population. Indian People are becoming richer day by day, but India is becoming poorer minute by minute. This issues defy easy solution, but tough decision need to be taken. 
0 0 हेलमेट अभियान के सुधार हेतु सूझाव अगर सरकार ने हेलमेट अभियान सुरु किया है तो उसमे थोड़ा सा सुधार करे। जैसे किसी व्यक्ति के पास हेलमेट नहीं है तो ट्रैफिक पुलिस उसका चालान करती है उसके वजाय ट्रैफिक पुलिस वाले उस व्यक्ति को उसी समय हेलमेट दे और हेलमेट के पैसे ले । उससे उसके पास हेलमेट भी हो जायेगा अगर उसे दूसरी बार फिर बिना हेलमेट पकड़ा गया तव फिर से उसे हेलमेट दे इससे वह व्यक्ति हेलमेट लगान के लिये मजबूर हो जाएगा और भ्रष्टाचार कम होगा।

1 0 Human trafficking is a egregious curse on our whole society. I request to modi g plz enact a tough and strong law against child kidnapping and trafficking in parliament. Around ncr in haryana there are lots of cases of trafficking and prostitution. you should enact death sentence for child trafficking and kidnapping. there are lots of children u can see begging around public places, these children are victims of trafficking. A TOUGH LEGITIMATE STRICT LAW (DEATH SENTENCE) IS THE DEMAND OF TODAY.

0 0 योग को विश्वशान्ति का आधार बनाया जाये: सभी धर्मो की साधनाओं का लक्ष्य ईश्वर मिलन है और ईश्वर मिलन के मार्ग को योग कहते हैं। योग का तात्पर्य मात्र आसन-प्राणायाम ही नहीं बल्कि ईश्वर प्राप्ति भी है। जिस प्रकार आयुर्वेद सभी जीवन पद्धतियों की जननी है, उसी प्रकार योग सभी धार्मिक साधनाओं का उद्गम स्रोत है। योग और आयुर्वेद मनुष्य जाति की साझी विरासत है। ये मनुष्य जाति के शारीरिक रोगों के ही नहीं, बल्कि सामाजिक रोगों जैसे धर्म और सभ्यता आधारित संघर्षों के भी समाधान का आधार बनाये जाने योग्य है।

1 0 My idea for aadhar card. Why we should not remove other id proof and make only one proof card Aadhar. Without proper planning previous govt implemented this policy. Otherwise it should be like make Aadhar card based on chip system and all the id proof details with biometric including. Provide the default voting rights based on age conditions, PAN details, DL etc. Flag check in centralized database. Then install and connect  Aadhar soft and database with all ATMs to use as online voting machine 
1 0 I want suggests an idea to Modi gov to minimize road traffic and reduce petrol/diesel consumption. I am observing on daily basis that due to lot of rushed in public transport people are preferring private vehicle. We face high traffic during office hours.

I am sock to see this and could not understand why companies are not adding in policy.

0 0 To prevent human trafficking we have to first understand why this trafficking is taking place.In India human trafficking(H.T.) is mainly due to poor sex ratio in Haryana, Rajasthan to meet the marriage needs of boys also in our country poor people in lack of awareness send there small children to city for work where they are captured by some group of bhikhari gang or else they work on small stalls as child labour this also a big reason of H.T. also for prostitution, girls are kidnapped .

1 0 Hon. Prime Minister, India, I am submitting you an innovative draft on appointment of 'grameen mitra' in every village. This proposal will definitely help the villagers and it will be a revolutionary step for transforming the village life. I request you to pay attention on it. Thanks and Regards, Dr. Akshay Y. Bajad "PROPOSAL FOR APPOINTMENT OF 'GRAMEEN MITRA' (FRIEND OF VILLAGERS) IN EVERY VILLAGE" [1] SELECTION PROCESS: (A) Gram Sabha of every village will have the power of selection/election of grameen mitra. (B) The members of gram sabha will be able to select grameen mitra with mutual understanding (C) If more than one candidate are interested then the selection should be done by voting at gram sabha meeting. (D) If more than one grameen mitra are required then the candidates having highest number of votes should be selected. (E) The selection/election of grameen mitra should be done in the presence of BDO (Block Development Officer) or his representative. [2] ELIGIBILITY: (A) Besides being a citizen of India, the individual should be a domicile of that village. (or any village which comes under the jurisdiction of that gram panchayat, in case of group gram panchayat) (B) He/She should not be less than 21 yrs. of age. (C) He/She should be at least HSSC (Higher Secondary School Certificate) passed. (D) He/She should not be a government employee. [3] NUMBER OF GRAMEEN MITRA FOR VILLAGE: At least 300 people of voting age to 1500 (population) : 01 1501-3000 : 02 3001-4500 : 03 4501-6000 : 04 6001-7500 : 05 7501-9000 : 06 [4] EMOLUMENT: (A) Grameen mitra will be considered as a volunteer (like ASHA workers). But state government should give fixed allowance to him. (which will be based on a basic set of activities which he will have to perform every month) (B) In addition to this, state government should give him outcome-based remuneration and financial compensation for training days. [For example: (1) Bringing more than 30% of the total members for gram sabha meeting = Rs. 200 per meeting (2) School admission = 100 Rs. per child (3) e-literacy = 200 Rs. per candidate (4) Travel to the tehsil/district/nearby cities (for helping the villagers) = 100 Rs. per travelling] (C) The stationery allowance should be given by the state government. [5] TRAINING: (A) Before appointing the grameen mitra, state government should give him training for at least two months  (B) The training will include the basic knowledge of local government, Indian constitution, right to information act, consumer protection act, prevention of atrocities act, banking procedures, various government schemes, land registration, computer and internet, etc. (C) Capacity building of grameen mitra is a continuous process. He will have to undergo series of training episodes to acquire the necessity knowledge, skills and confidence for performing his spelled out roles. [6] OFFICE AND TIME OF WORKING: (A) There will be no separate office for him. Villagers will be able to approach him directly at his home, at any time. (B) The time grameen mitra spend on his tasks (3 A's - Awareness, Aid and Attention) will be relatively flexible. [7] ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES: Grameen mitra will basically perform three types of roles in village life, viz. a social reformer (by making social awareness), a friend of villagers (by helping the villagers) and a vigilant citizen (by examining the functioning of gram panchayat and government officials). [3 A's of grameen mitra = Awareness, Aid and Attention] (A) AS A SOCIAL REFORMER: (1) He will work for the involvement of villagers to create a mass movement to improve quality of life in village. (2) He will go door-to-door to give detailed information about various government schemes. (3) He will make awareness about superstition, casteism, female foeticide, child marrige, honour killing and other social problems and will work against them. (4) He will make awareness about health, sanitation and education and will take efforts to stop the leakage of students from the schools. (5) Some villagers are apathetic towards the gram sabha. He will generate enthusiasm in them to take part in the gram sabha meetings. (B) AS A FRIEND OF VILLAGERS: (1) Some villagers (mainly women and dalits) hesitates to raise their questions in gram sabha meeting due to fear or shyness. They will be able to tell their problems to the grameen mitra before gram sabha meeting. He will put these issues in gram sabha meeting on behalf of them (without mentioning their names). (2) He will help the sarpanch and panchayat secretary to provide the benefits of government schemes to the needy villagers. (3) He will provide a common platform to all the villagers for their queries and complaints. Any villager having any type of query or complaint about any government official or service, will be able to directly submit it towards the grameen mitra. It will be the duty of grameen mitra to forward these queries and complaints in a proper format to the respective departments and to take regular follow up of them. (as majority of villagers are unaware of where and how to register their complaints and from where and how to get information) (4) Grameen mitra will guide the villagers for obtaining agricultural loans from banks, cast certificates, income certificates, domicile certificates, etc. from SDM (Sub-Divisional Magistrate) office or tehsil, for registration of lands at sub-registrar office and for other official works. (5) He will go to the tehsil, banks or other government offices with the villagers, who are illiterate or completely unaware of these procedures, for helping them. It will stop the loot of illiterate villagers by the corrupt government officials and will save their important time. (6) He will guide the village students regarding the career opportunities and will help them for taking admission in the colleges of nearby cities, for higher education. (7) Government should provide him a computer with internet facility (at his home or at gram panchayat office). And it will be his duty to give basic knowledge regarding the use of computer and internet to the villagers. He will also help the villagers to get information about new agricultural techniques, recent agricultural trends, weather conditions, etc. (8) Students will be able to get his help to obtain information about various exams, scholarships, job vacancies, etc. and to apply for the same. (9) He will work to resolve the quarrels between the villagers and will try to secure peace and establish unity among them. (10) He will try to resolve the disputes between gram panchayat secretary, sarpanch and gram panchayat councillors and will maintain good relationship between them. (11) He will be able to give innovative suggestions to the sarpanch and gram panchayat councillors to promote the programmes of adult education, family welfare, etc. [C] AS A VIGILANT CITIZEN: (1) The quality of life indicators such as primary education, employment, safe drinking water, open defecation free village, toilets in individual houses as well as public places, solid and liquid waste management, cleanliness of all public places as well as individual houses, pucca roads and streets, transport and last mile connectivity, power and street lights, primary health center, internet connectivity, reduction in infant mortality rate and maternal mortality rate, etc. will be periodically assessed by him on behalf of the villagers. And it will be his duty to produce this assessment report at every gram sabha meeting. (2) He will raise the issues related with public interest in gram sabha meeting. (3) On behalf of the villagers, he will examine the functioning of school teachers, PHC doctors, gram panchayat officials and other government employees which are providing service to the villagers and the official records of the same will be scrutinized by him. (4) He will also have the power of examining the functioning of sarpanch and village councillors. (5) He will produce his report on the functioning of these government officials and elected members at every gram sabha meeting. (6) He will be able to just praise or critisize them before the villagers in gram sabha meeting but will have no power to take action against them. If there is any serious issue, he will be able to send his report to the BDO or other concerned departments. Shortly, he will perform a role of lokpal (or we can say it as a 'grampal') at village level. In this way the active inspection by grameen mitra will lead to enhance the quality of service and to reduce corruption. [8] WORK ASSESSMENT: (A) Grameen mitra will be accountable to the gram sabha and thus he should produce his work report at every gram sabha meeting. (B) The periodical assessment of his work will be done by the gram sabha. [9] REMOVAL: (A) Once appointed, the grameen mitra will remain in service until his retirement age of 60 yrs. or death. (B) He will be able to give his resignation to the sarpanch. (C) If he doesn't work satisfactory then the gram sabha will be able to hold his allowance or suspend him (for maximum of 2 months). (D) If a request letter for the dismission of grameen mitra, signed by at least 100 members of gram sabha, is given to the BDO then he will have to give order to arrange a special gram sabha meeting. In this meeting, under the chairmanship of BDO or his representative, voting will be done. If the dismission of grameen mitra is supported by a majority of members (and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members for women and dalits) then he will be dismissed. And a new grameen mitra will be selected/elected in his place in the same gram sabha meeting. »Clarifications for your questions: (A) How does the position of village mitra avoid the duplication of panchayat councillors or members? (1) Panchayat councillors are the representative of their wards while grameen mitra will be selected/elected by gram sabha. (2) Village councillors are accountable to the villagers of their wards where as grameen mitra will be accountable to all the villagers and will provide service to them. (3) The duty of village councillors is the proper utilization of the fund for the development of villagers while grameen mitra will inspect their functioning. (4) Some duties of grameen mitra related with social awareness coincides with the duties of village councillors but here we have to understand that they have to work together for the involvement of villagers to create a mass movement to improve the quality of life in villages. Besides this the other duties of grameen mitra are far different from the duties of village councillors. (5) Village councillors are elected for 5 yr. term where as grameen mitra will remain in service until his retirement age of 60 yrs. or death. In this way the position of grameen mitra avoids the duplication of panchayat councillors. (B) How does the position of village mitra avoid the duplication of panchayat secretary or officials? (1) Panchayat secretary is accountable to the BDO while grameen mitra will be accountable to the villagers. (2) Panchayat secretary performs all administrative work of Village Panchayat like recovery of taxes and fees, recording proceedings of Village Panchayat meetings, giving notice of occurence of vacancy in a Village Panchayat, serving the notices of motion of no confidence, maintaining the accounts of Village Panchayat, maintaining the accounts of cattle-pounds, maintaining the records of births and deaths in the Village Panchayat, etc. and he works for the government and sarpanch where as the grameen mitra will work for the villagers. (3) The duties of panchayat secretary and grameen mitra are totally different from each other. In this way the position of village mitra avoids the duplication of panchayat secretary and officials. (C) Shall he be a government officer or elected member? He will be an elected volunteer. But he will get fixed remuneration (which will be based on a basic set of activities which he will have to perform every month) + outcome-based remuneration (like ASHA workers) and financial compensation for training days. (D) Do you want him to sit regularly or work like a freelancer? (1) There will be no separate office for him. Villagers will be able to approach him directly at his home, at any time. (2) The time grameen mitra spend on his tasks (3 A's - Awareness, Aid and Attention) will be relatively flexible. (3) Though grameen mitra is considered as a volunteer, we can't say him as a freelancer because he will get fixed + outcome-based remuneration from state government. (E) Any proposed number of population a village mitra shall serve? At least 300 people of voting age to 1500 (population) : 01 1501-3000 : 02 3001-4500 : 03 4501-6000 : 04 6001-7500 : 05 7501-9000 : 06

0 0 Hello, If we can implement a tax for cleaning on the products which spreads uncleanliness, like food products, packaged food, chemical industry etc.. In this way we can collect the expenses from the people who are the main cause of spreading this uncleanliness, and also reduce the Muncipal taxes from the concernd departments.

0 0 NHAI should be supported and monitored to ensure we build good quality roads across the country, the pace at which vehicles are growing is going to make many cities develop major traffic issues that leads to inefficiencies across all walks of life as travel time increases, inside city road and traffic system as well as inter state highways require development, modern and smart development! well rounded development goes longer than short term compartmentalized development.

0 0 for stopping human trafficking we have to legalise some areas speciffically for prosituutes...with a police view on those their each employee data, where they come from, time they are in this, any force to do this, councellers for them to motivate to come in main streams, in all over india a movement in poor villages or poor slum areas to prevent their girl childs from bad people. above all for poor peoples girl childs food, clothes, study free by the state goverment. 
0 0 There should be a separate department to stop human trafficking. In case of child each and every wander child should be asked for his/her identity. Children at railway stations and other public places are victims of human traffickers who forced them begging and crimes. Likewise children working as home servant should be registered with proof of identity. At most of the public places women carrying infant are looked begging, It should also be verified. 
0 0 it should be given power to inspect industries mainly like brick kilns,crushing units,quarries,because people who are trafficked are mostly sold to the owners of the above industries.it shoulbe given the powers of a civil court for effective investigation 
0 0 Every village should have a registry of the kids being sent to the city for various purposes. If the people taking the kids to the city are asked to fill some form/document, it will leave some trace for further investigations. And it will also discourage the traffickers. 
4 0 I think that the public should not be stopped on the road for a  VIP movement. It is harrassing and humiliating for general public. Why should masses feel unimportant at cost of some VIP 
1 0 In most of the cases, when a girl is married, her sibling (generally brother) occupies the property of the parents.If her husband and her in-laws leave her then she goes to her brother"s house for shelter. If the brother is not happy to share his property  with her she has no home to live in,and also does not have supplies to live a happy life. There should be a law regarding to women"s right to property of parents and in-laws so that every woman has a good place to live in . 
1 0 Poor and illiterate people are usually cheated by traffickers. They are told that "we will take your child to the city and he/she will get employment". The parents trust them and hand over their children. So people should be educated to not trust such people. They should also be made aware that people can pretend to marry their daughters and then use them for trafficking. And also important is solving the financial problems of such people so that they don't hand over their kids for such reasons. 
0 0 All big bussiness men shoulf be made socially accoutable and responsible which is to be linked to there earning and source of earning like any industrialist who put industry in remote area he should make adarsh gram to that village and surroiding village by providing road, electricity, water, house, education , skill development, promotion of their are and culture apart from providing advance technology tools , employement because their earninh is on the cost of health , land amd their resource 
0 0 In my view contrition shall be given by all to make India corruption free. 
0 0 In my views, one Kind of system is required to providing subsidized facilities/incentives to the citizen of India where the subsidy shall directly goes in the hand/bank account to the people. Further the subsidy shall be given only to those people who are contributing to the national growth like family consisting of two plus two members only. Similarly this can be implemented in all the govt. schemes and incentives. The subsidy or incentives can be restricted to 2+2 person families. 
1 0 India should be projected as spiritual destination of world. It is the land of Rama, Krishna, Buddha, Sankara, Vivekananda, Ramayana, Mahabharatha, Geeta, Ayurveda, Sanskrit, Yoga & Yogis,Himalayas,Sacred rivers,long sea shores etc.That would make India an ideal destination for anyone seeking peace & harmony. In these days of war & terrorism, more and more people are likely to turn into spiritual way and we should use it as an opportunity to attract people to India and foreign exchange too. 
0 0 I would like to share my views on human trafficking.we need to 1 Be aware 2 Advocacy 3Action. We need to stop modern slavery by these points which we need to keep in mind.I belive no one can do anything but everyone can do something.We all need to play our part,as a responsible citizen and we all need to be a part of it to stop it.

3 1 In most of the Govt./Semi Govt.Offices/Private Sector,/Personnel working etc.there is provision for accountability to complete a job/project whatsoever. Likewise , why don't some criteria should be set for "Judiciary" and "Advocates" to decide the case whatever be the in nature. There must be review system for "Judges" , a time period to award the decision and each and every advocate must list the no. of cases he is handling .By this pending list in courts will come down . 
2 0 Change at grassroots level to make the program sustainable,educate through schools,colleges,universities.Host an awareness event,documentary films,etc.Mobile applications for current human trafficking news.Increase scholarship about publishing an article, teaching a class, or hosting a symposium.Encourage your local newspaper or television station to cover stories about human trafficking.Poverty is a major contributor to human trafficking, sponsor a child or woman in poverty stricken areas. 
1 0 The greed to earn colossal amount in less time has made many person stoop to such level where they don't even hesitate to indulge in human trafficking  which is not only inhuman but also serious for the largest democratic country like India. It appears people have no humanity left in them. A sincere effort should be made not only on the part of govt. but the society as well. People need to be cautious about the activities going around them and take action sensibly to the rightful conclusion. 
1 0 We are in the largest democratic country in the world for name sake. Our people representatives will speak and question about human traffic. Is they really representing people of India?. If they are representing people, then they have to respect every Indian and there is any problem, they have to solve via govt administration and police. Otherwise they will keep questioning like outsiders of country. There is huge propaganda for swatch Bharath, why not big awareness on human trafficking 
0 0 Real state transaction in India is major sources of generating black money within in India. It is mainly due to major difference in DLC prices and market prices . To curb this kindly increase the DLC prices near to prevailing market prices and reduce the registration charges on that proportion , a huge black money will reduced in our system. 
0 0 In order to boost productivity in agriculture sector new technology and advanced knowledge (e.g. in organic farming) could be brought by NRIs to India. To make it possible however there is need to remove the barrier for acquiring agricultural land by NRIs.

So. their should be guide line  if one elected Member fail to visit all his area less than twice then he should not be allowed to stand again and his pension/salary may be stopped. and council of minister, Governor have visit whole area without fail accordingly.

1 0 Sound health can only bring healthy moralistic which is   difficult to achieve without active contribution of Ayurveda along with yoga in present socio economic scenario..It is wise step of the government to create separate ministry for its development but nothing concrete or new seem to be moving in this ministry.Therefore A separate group need to be created and feed back obtained from common public and professional for utilisation in policy making and effective implementation. 
0 0 Sanctity of National Flag: At the time of independence when the try colour flag was accepted as our National Flag, no political party or entity shall use it as the flag. This confuses and make ordinary citizens believe party color as that of government / nation. In the whole world, nopolitical party is allowed to use national flag or something similar to that as party flag. There is need to prohibit the use of our national flag by political party/s to maintain the sanctity of the national flag!

1 0 Police department with strong spies under higher dignitaries is very essential for preventing human trafficking. There is an urgent need for a strong spy agency under government to address issues such as terrorism and trafficking. This should not be exclusive like IB & RAW but intricately woven into all departments along independent spies 
1 0 Being secular is good but for the sake of secularism it is not fair to indulge such a personality like Mahamana Malaviya Ji who made a university under British regime and he never named it Hindu university but Gandhiji added the very word.Mahamana served Indian national congress and now he is just a shrewd politician who used university for propaganda. We are deeply hurt being students and being citizens of Kashi, a place which respects and welcomes all religions. 
0 0 i'm from banaras a student of bhu,founder Mahamana, got an article by A G Noorani that the city, bhu campus and its students are hindu militant and even Mahamana is criticised as shrewd politician and a person who didn't have any respect to other religions. I want to  request plz go through the article "A portrait of Propagandist' bcoz we neither Hindu militant nor communal. It'll be a shame if we do't protest such thing bcoz we know what Kashi is,a place of knowledge since 5000 yrs is it fair.

India should be a safe place and not a nation where we have ppl with multi drug resistance

1 0 The RTA is an inefficient Organization. Requirement of NOC to register a Vehicle is a practice aiding and abetting corruption by agents. A vehicle is presented in the RTA when the Ownership has changed to pay Taxes and Reregister the Vehicle. The procedure must be made online IMMEDTIATELY. If a Vehicle is involved in a crime or is stolen the database must be maintained across India in a CENTRAL DATABANK. Responsibility is of the GOI and not the individual to prove his vehicle records

0 0 Prevent crime: Full Time maid should be termed Slavery job. A 14 year girl can be hired as full time maid in urban homes. Such girls have no power to go out, talk to anyone, and further harassed for work. Its an opportunity for men in the house to rape her when alone. Refer link http://wp.me/p3dJz1-c7 
1 0 There has to be close tie-ups with local police to gather local grass-root intelligence on the movement of any trafficking rackets. The missing cases in case of ages as small as 8-10 to as late as 30s need to be verified compulsorily by the HTPA as well. The authorities should crack down on prostitution and escort rackets and the so called ''massage parlors'' to check the pimping of trafficked girls.Size,discipline & training of all such law & order agencies needs to be national service oriented 
1 0 Taboo against such sensitive issues has  to be lifted. For education and awareness to prevail, it is important that regular gatherings are held in presence of a psychologist. The main aim of such meetings would be to educate the section of audience that is more vulnerable of falling victim to human trafficking practices. 
1 0 IN telangana, trafficking of women  to gulf , in the pretext of employment is common, i request the govt to enact stricter laws to protect women from gulf agents , unorganized domestic servents , should be made organized , minimum wages should be paid as per hour basis. MODIJI first start protecting children and women from exploiters and traffickers 
0 0 Implementation of existing laws in letter and spirit.  In long term, education system with high moral values should be implemented. Discipline, values, physical health and hygiene and social awareness and responsibilities should be the main curriculum in the primary sections. This would solve many of the problems and would help build better India. 
0 1 Yesterday, I came across with a news that the LPG subsidy is likely to be considered as Income and as such subjected to tax. It is not understood what goal will be achieved with this. It is also not understood once the Govt. has already noticed that Creamy layer of the society is availing LPG subsidy then why suitable steps to discontinue subsidy to creamy layer is not taken without any delay. Politiials/Govt.servants having income of 100000/- PM must be asked to stop availing this subsidy. 
1 0 Sir, the agency needs intelligence inputs from locals, a dedicated help line, a help desk at all police stations, a state / regional co-ordinator to utilise input from NGO's working in rehabilitation will be useful. Most often trafficking takes place in economically backward regions, hence extra attention should be given to monitor these districts and developmental activity should be given a fillip. Women & children are the main casualties, increased societal awareness & rehabilitation is needed

0 0 Make child labour prostitution and crime against Women on par with rape murder and terrorism and laws should be made more stringent to deal with such criminals who indulges in such heinous crimes and black list offenders for life and absolutely no mercy should be shown towards criminals even if its their first crime.

0 0 Child labour should be stopped it is still prevalent 
0 0 The children must be trained for self defense moreover some device like watch with tracker should be made available at low cost. The punishment should be tough enough that no one should dare to do such type of crimes. 
0 0 At toll plaza use Microwave or X-ray scanner to see inside Big Truck. Connect these scanner to IB and NIA like agencies. So that they can identify how many people are trafficked by hacker. 
0 0 Human Trafficking is a hinious crime therefore the punishment must be tough for those involved in this act of trafficking.HTPA must demand Life Term & Media should play their role to highlight the crime as well as the punishment. The present Laws are sufficient but need is to act sincerly otherwise no agency will be effective.The honesty is above all ; honesty is required to prevent any type of crimes.In fact due to curruption criminals are roaming free as they do not have fear knowing very well that systems are roten.The society will not be free from crime unless Law immplimenting agencies are free from curruption.

0 0 There are many reserved police forces whom must be used to do such duties.......... Let each of us be the enforcing team to stop Human traffiking. Sections 366(A) and 372 of IPC makes this as a severe offence .... Beware and Behave ..... 
0 0 Its a serious issue, need to strength enforcement units 
0 0 there can be one example .....friends you everyday go through the environment as 1. lots of advertisement shows half or full exposed scenes and we have to think that scenes are always of girls why??????? 2. when movies are completely out of the range of sensor board. there is no restriction on the exposed or nude scenes. so please FRIEND think our it and our government should think deeply over it. 
0 0 here are many many problems in front of our youth....specially in social and traditional life. n our country our youth is completely finished in both the ways i.e socially and traditionally. now a days we are living in the modern world. but at this stage i do not think it is so. i understand it as a so called modernization. but a question comes that we are going through a complete vulgar environment so that our youth is going out of the society completely. there is no moral values remained. 
0 0 youth for nation.... हिन्दुस्तान की सबसे बड़ी समस्या यह है कि यहाँ युवाओं से अपेक्षाएँ तो बहुत की जाती है पर उन्हे मौका नही दिया जाता । 
0 0 Human Trafficking is rampant among less developed areas. Police forces also are non-responsive to the missing kids/girls. Police reforms along with awareness are the first steps towards addressing this problem. 
0 0 Youth feel physicaly and emotionaly safe. youth feel the pride nd accountability that came with mastery. make career planing and annual event. map ur path since last career planing. examine ur past time nd hobbies. reflect on ur like nd dislike needs nd wants. improve ur communication skills. buid ur network. youth discovere self. gain personal satisfaction. set career nd job goals. youth develop quality relationship with peers nd adults. make note of ur past accomplishment. 
0 0 To counter this notorious sin, the introduction of the child to the bio metric identity should be done as soon as possible. like hospitals promote the neccecity of the vaccination and other check ups of the new born, likewise when the baby reaches the age of 9-12 months he/she should be enrolled in a bio metric identity database like the AADHAR. this can be scheduled with the routine check up of mother or as it can be convinient. This will led  proper identification of the child found anywhere. 
1 0 Web portal of Anti-Humant trafficking www.stophumantrafficking/mha.nic.in is not available, at the time of this post. I think the first basic step for the Agency is atleast they are available on the crucial call. Ambulance after patient death is waste, therefore All department should be available for service at any time. 
0 0 Poverty and ignorance are the major reasons. Education and  self employment promotion activities along with severe punishments should be imposed. Agents play a major role in human trafficking. These type of agencies are to be controlled. 
0 0 As long as people die from hunger and loopholes in the judicial systems exist, human trafficking, I am afraid, can not be stopped. To stop human trafficking, it is necessary to understand the mechanics that lead to the exploitation of millions of people, including the most educated. 
0 0 Shut the red light areas. Let the trafficked people not become someone's prey. make police investigation quicker in missing persons cases. heavy fines and quick case disposal of culprits. 
0 0 The main reason for human trafficking is poverty and unavailability of job. Every village should have job centres where people can enroll their names for type of work they want to do in the towns/ cities. When there is requirement of labourers in towns they can be intimated. The job centre should have full information about the employer and the labourers as well. People should also be educated about the cunningness of the agents and they should not fall prey to their alluring promises.

1 0 Hello Mr.Prime Minister, Since i am an ex-paramilitary person, wanted to suggest only 1 point regarding dress code of all police and defence personnel who wear Khaki. Nearly 90% of the employees whose dress is Khaki in colour, wanted change of colour, bcoz, 1.After wearing Khaki i and all felt like failure. Not proud. 2. Khaki is fearful dress, according to children and general public, bcoz they feel its bad. 3. Since khaki is existed since 1860's , should'nt we change, British people who introduced it , themself are not wearing and we are wearing unwantedly. 4. Not suitable for hot countries. 5. To make the police person's morale up, dress code has to change, as per me. 6. If i am wrong , then please make survey and then decide. 7. Once you give new dress code, it will like refreshing for crores of personnel whose duty is to safeguard law and order, and they feel different. 8. And overall right now nobody like Khaki people, nobody entertain them and as much as possible people try to avoid them. Am i right? 9. Its very simple , as a civilian , dont we feel proud or confident if we wear new dress or try different style? samething applies to them right?

As we just had a election in Jammu & Kashmir, still there is no government. So, first we should have to change the rule for government formation after election, if mandate is not clear. Otherwise election is just a waste of money. Below options can be followed: Largest party or pre-poll alliance will make government....to avoid the further expense of election.

1 0 The main reasons behind human trafficking are poverty related and kidnapping. Create a economic environment where earning would not be a problem, create Self Help groups etc. and as far as kidnapping is concerned local police has to be responsible but more often than not they themselves provide protection to these people and they frequent brothels free of cost.

Is it because they do not have organized Unions and Job security?. 
1 0 Human Trafficking is not considered as a burning national issue. So thousands of people are becoming victims to this devil. This is the right time the nation realizes the importance of eliminating this shameful activity. CORRUPTION is becoming the BIGGEST bottleneck for ANY AGENCY to deliver on their defined objectives and commitments. So we thought of putting a structure in place for the agency to function effectively and deliver on the set objectives. 
1 0 We all talk about human trafficking. But we should understand that it is not limited to girls being abducted for marriages or prostitution. But, also the children abducted and then put into as domestic servants. In order to stop this, we need to have a quick response by the police teams. many times it is noticed that police dont take early action leading to difficulty in tracing missing people.Strict action should be taken against errant police man. if proved guilty they should be punished.

2 0 Legalising sex industry, I think, is the only effective key to stop Human Trafficking. If that is not legalised, and sex workers are driven away from pors-corners, the filth of the society will not be centralised in a corner but will mushroom here and there polluting the whole society. So, legalise and control it so that no one joins this work force unwillingly through traffickers and the filth called red light area can be a certain place; not anywhere. 
1 0 The "Be Smart, Be Safe" brochures describe the tactics criminal groups use to coerce and traffic women, the jeopardy of trafficking, what women protect themselves against the groups, what are victims' rights in other countries, and how they can get help while in the country.Poverty and lack of economic opportunity make them potential victims of traffickers associated with international criminal syndicates. They are vulnerable to false promises of job opportunities and other luring promises.

0 0 Modi Sir... Appreciate you for great initiatives like - Swach Bharat Abhiyan, SAGY etc. But looking at number of villages we have, it will take ages to develop each & every village. Some village might improve phenomenally whereas others may lag due to diversion of funds. Therefore I request you to launch another initiatives where people like us can develop a village as well (Nagrik GY). We all have our roots connected to village & that way this can be developed as a mass movement. 
1 0 In my opinion Government should consider bringing transgenders in the main stream by utilizing their potential in various fields where there contribution will be immense for the good of society.In earlier times lso they were utilized for security of palaces etc.Their deployment in police and ensuring cleanliness will not only be helpfull for society but help transgenders for their respectfull living and earnings.Recently in Chhattisgarh one transgrnder has been elected as MAYOR

1 0 All the efforts towards cleaner/greener India, Skill development and Digitalization will be more effective and worthwhile if one more agenda of birth control can be introduced. Strangely none of the government talks about this or try to spread the benefits of smaller family in citizens though everybody talks silently that exploding Population is the main reason behind failing all schemes driven by Govt.'s. We have everything in plenty and as simple as that one Apple can be divide as half in two 
0 0 like registering the birth of child we should implement DNA testing and recording the data at national data storage at the time of birth. Birth certificate should not be issued till DNA testing is done. This DNA data should be available to all the police an security departments fodepartmemts. This will help identify every citizen of INDIA. Child birth certificate and aadhar card should be issued simultaneously. This aadhar number and biometry will also help identify every citizen . 
1 0 For surajya, Can I ask government to make the working style of the consumer court more effective?  I have filled a consumer case in year 2014 & now it is 2015, but still the case is not resolve.

The simple case which if judge pay just 30-40 min time, can be solve on the spot without any delay. 
1 0 Uncontrolled growth in Population leads to poverty and illiteracy which ultimately leads to Human Trafficking. So along-with an agency like Human Trafficking Prevention Agency (HTPA) there should be approaches to address the problem of increasing population inter alia. 
0 0 Tax on Remittance : NRI's contribute over USD 70 Billion to India annually, tax on remittance is a big deterrent. While the Govt may be right to Tax Corporate Remittance individual remittance from employed (both blue collared and  white collared)  will expose them to Havala Route. This would also discourage people like me to remit my savings to India and would rather save outside India . This will be a betrayal to millions working abroad !!

1 0 Continued: for getting an LPG gas cylinder. This should be implemented not because of any deficiency of service but because of ease of convenience. If a person gets transferred from one city to another or changes his house from one locality to another in the same city, he will be able to avail services of the gas agency which is nearest to his area in the new city or locality and it will become easier for him to visit the office for any work,if needed. 
1 0 The Department of Telecom a few years ago launched Mobile Number Portability which enabled the customers to change their telecom operator without having the need to change the mobile number if they were not satisfied with the services of the operator.

1 0 Strong anti trafficking law and strict implementation, fast track courts to deal with it. Strong rehabilitation program for the victims (including skill training) and incentive for those, who are willing to take care of them. And if you really want to curb, there must be a dedicated law to deal (to protect and not to stop them) with domestic help and other trafficking victims. It has be a multi pronged approach, with the involvement of govt., agencies, NGO etc, so as to make it effective.

1 0 This is a very shameful act by some people to earn money and riches at the cost of invaluable lives of their own brothers and sisters.i think there are several causes that lead people to follow these horryfying acts.want of money,lack of employment,mean political motives etc.it's also seen that victims are also passively involved in it as they have very little choice for their survival.goveent must take strict action against such practices.establishing an agency for this will be a great idea. 
1 0 sir, to stop trafficking please put check on agents who help in hiring domestic help in metros.They bring children from tribal areas and put them as contractual labour.no one is getting benefited in this business except these agents. child labour,human trafficking and tax evasion is closely related and this gives more profit to agents then sending girls to sex industry. pls refer to real time experience on this link : http://india-ananalysis.blogspot.in/2014/12/blog-post.html 
1 0 प्रधानमंत्री जी, पार्लियामेंट का बजट सत्र में एक भी मिनट बर्वाद न हो,इसके लिए अभी से वातावरण बनाना चाहिए।विरोधीपक्ष में कुछ सूधार होने को नहीं है,इसलिये सरकार को  सभी कदम उठाने को तत्पर रहना चाहियेजो नियमानुकूल हो।मिडिया के द्वारा अभी से सरकार को स्पष्ट कर देना चाहिए की अगले सत्र में कोई हल्ला हंगामा स्वीकार नहीं होगा.संसद विचार विमर्श के लिए है,नौटंकी के लिए नहीं।सरकार सभी बिषयों पर बहस करेगी,पर हंगामा करने वालों को ससद सेउस दिन या पुरे सत्र के लिए निष्कासित कर दिया जायेगा।और कोई उपाय नहीं है। 
1 0 रक्षामंत्री जी, पाकिस्तानी सेना के विरुद्ध आप के द्वारा अब तक  की गई कार्रवाई निसंदेह प्रसन्शनिय है।पर यह यथेष्ट नहीं है क्योंकि सिज़फायर उल्लंघन अभी भी हो रहा है।जवाबी फायर तो दुगनी या तिगुनी होनी ही चाहिए।लेकिन उन्हें यह भी बता देना चाहिए की अगर वे 10 चौकी पर फायर करेंगे तब हम 20 चौकियों को उसी दिन तहस नहस कर देंगे।ऐसाएक दो दिन करके देखा जा सकता है क्योंकि उनसे बात चित करने का कोई तुक नहीं है।उनपर प्रेसर बनाने में यह उपाय कारगर हो सकता है।इसपर कृपया विचार करें। 
1 0 प्रधानमंत्री जी, पेट्रोल,डीज़ल के अंतराष्ट्रीय कीमतों में भारी गिरावट हुई है ,लेकिन उसका पूरा लाभ जनता को नहीं मिल रहा है।यह सरकार की वायदा खिलाफी है।तेल की कीमत बढ़ाते समय यह वायदा किया गया था कि अंतर राष्ट्रिय कीमतों में कमी होने पर उसी के अनुसार कीमतों में कमी की जायेगी।पर अब एक्साइज ड्यूटी बढाकर सरकार जनता को लाभ न देकर वादा खिलाफी कर रही है।कोई भी तर्क इसे जस्टिफाई नहीं कर सकता है।वित जुटाने के लिए भ्रस्ट नेताओं का प्रॉपर्टी जप्त करें,न की आम जनता से ठगी करें। 
1 0 Adding further... Whenever the educated and people living in the urban areas see any child at signals or working as a child labour, this should be reported to police so that appropriate action takes place to track down the criminals. 
1 0 The main reason for which people get trafficked is the 'Job Requirement'. Generally, trafficking takes place when people want to earn for their living and they fall pray to wrong people. Trafficking is seen mainly in the rural areas of India where people are not aware of their rights, This mainly happens because they are not educated. Thus, the main thing we can do to stop this is make them aware of such things happening in the country, and training them to act as informers whenever they see act 
2 0 प्रधानमंत्री जी, पुलिस अधिकारीयों को आदर्श,सुसंस्कृत,सच्चरित्र और सुयोग्य होना बहुत आवश्यक है।नशा करना और नशे में ड्यूटी करना एक गंभीर अपराध है।क्या आप नशे में ड्यूटी करने वाले पुलिस कर्मचारियों/अधिकारियों के विरुद्ध कठोर कार्रवाई करने का साहस जुटाएंगे? नशे में धुत कर्मचारियों/अधिकारियों से कर्तव्यपालन का उम्मीद करना बेमानी है।इसके लिए आप को कोई कानून बनाने की आवश्यकता नहीं है।सिर्फ कठोरतापूर्वक कार्रवाई कीजरुरत है।दोचार पुलिसवाले दोषीकर्मचारियों/अधिकारियों कोबर्खास्त करदीजिये,समाधान होजायेगा 
1 0 This is very essential for sustainability of the nation.  There are many reports in the media it seems much more than. (particularly in the old city of hyderabad).

When Senior citizen can get it why cant PwDs. Pls do it on top priority. As a parent and a social worker I am sharing this  with a great hope from Hon. Railway Minister & PM. 
1 0 Our education system should focus on making children in to good citizens and not only engineers and doctors. Recent happenings in the society against girls is also because of education without social relevance. Better to mould a child than punishing the elder after the damage has been done.

1 0 The latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau states that over 60,000 children go missing every year in India --- that’s one child every eight minutes or seven every hour. Of these, on an avg more than 22,000 are not found. First of all this rate should come down by closing all FIR's relating to these kind of cases. This should be done by giving targets to every state to reduce the FIR's by 30% atleast. Also central agency to co-ordinate and keep a track for this should be formed.

If the society just learn to bear the responsibility to protect its neighbour, i don't see any reason that human trafficking can take place. The problem is our divided societies. Can we all not make one society for the India, 'The Society of Human beings'?

1 0 It should be made mandatory to get identity of a person before giving him accommodation on rental basis.Whenever one unknown person is seen in an area for more than once, local police station should be informed. Provision should be made for Local Police Stations to take a diary of such information and do the necessary inquiries.  Thus we can avoid many instances like explosion, drug smuggling, human trafficking. 
2 0 HTPA is running under guidance (shadow) of political,police and power(money).these 3 are using innocent women for their works and money. so first these three to be clean for eradication of htpa. 
6 0 a major cause of human trafficking is the corruption in the police force.The police are well aware where, when, how and to what extent criminal activities are being conducted,but when they are either paid by these criminals a regular hafta, or these activities are conducted by the kin of politicians the police look the other side 
1 0 I think awarwness n girl- education should be made n rural areas.And atleast one member n a family should be given govt.job specially in northeast states..This reduce the possibility of selling their child due to poverty..And indirectly human trafficking s reduced..Protection to the victims should also be given.

2 0 Poverty and lack of economic opportunity make women and children potential victims of traffickers associated with international criminal organizations. They are vulnerable to false promises of job opportunities in other countries. Many of those who accept these offers from what appear to be legitimate sources find themselves in situations where their documents are destroyed, their selves or their families threatened with harm, or they are bonded by a debt that they have no chance of repaying.

1 0 We Indians must bow down our heads in shame for not providing decent livelyhood to our women.Our ancestors had respect to womanhood by advising that " where woman is worshipped, God will reside". Now in current scenario, we are downgrading ourselves by not giving fair opportunity to women to lead respectable and decent life. Human trafficking must be stopped. we must have social agenda of imparting education,creating jobs and assure them of better sustainable good days ahead

1 0 80 % Human Trafficking is done for commercial sex 20 % for Bonded Labor.80 % such people hail from North East,Nepal,West Bengal,Bihar etc.And main reason for this is poverty. Central Government/State Government should select poor villages in different areas and make them Economically strong.Open schools,Shops,Small scale Industry.So that these poor people are not lured by Contractors for cash benefit.

The Government money is no body's ownership is true???? Will Union of India look in to this mismanagement? 
1 0 Human trafficking takes place because the teeming poor have no source of income or work. Private companies which don't hire a security guard for money saving will pay more than a crore to a fresh IIM graduate. This gap has to be bridged by legislation.

MOREOVER, IT WILL CREATE MORE INNOVATIVE THOUGHTS AMONG THE EMPLOYEES  FOR BANKING/FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORMS/DEVELOPMENT.   BANK STAFF COMMITMENT IN NATION BUILDING  IS NOT COMPARABLE 
1 0 Poverty is a major factor which allows human trafficking, particularly young girls for prostitution. Close watch needs to be maintained in railway and bus stations and suspects should be questioned by the police in presence of some NGO representative. Education of girl child and creation of gainful job opportunities in the rural areas like food processing and health care sector needs to be speeded up.IPC be suitably amended for more stringent punishment to the offenders by fast track courts. 
1 0 It is due to some motto 1 For begging purposes 2 for criminal activity 3 For cheap labour purposes 4 For human organ selling 5 Naxal and terrorist activity it is more or less related to poverty humanity in us as the syndicate which operated begging activity is one of human trafficking because it is business in our country since long now a days it reduce due to awareness and busy schedule development and infrastructure development so location are reduce but previous it was major reason  of this 
1 0 To PM This is regarding to section of public transport.I did hear from my sister that during her visit to Singapore she found that every vehicle was embedded with an accounting system in it where it had a direct link to the drivers bank account with a fixed amount of money.On finding any guilt of the driver like he avoids the signal an amount of money would automatically get deleted from the account.I found this as 1 possible way of avoiding accidents in traffic cities like Bangalore. 
0 0 Mr. PM... Pls keep a watch on the developments going in Gujarat..There is increase in corrruption and crime rate in Gujarat...Pls control the same...Thanks 
1 0 As per my view ban of  human trafficking can be possible practically upto an extend by making each and every citizens aware about their rights. 
1 0 As per my feeling the all such ideas are marketed in cities only and also in social media ,but if such innovative ideas are implemented in ground level in remote areas than only the meaning has take some weight and benifit to the common mass.. 
0 0 The word that is TRADE of HUMAN being in the modern era is blemishing for us. Agency should spread awareness about it mostly in the remote zone or in the villages where it all started and also government should develop those areas with economic as well as communication.Agency should trace back victims way to hell with the help of police and also rehabilitate the victims.

1 0 The conditions of our highways being bad as they are, the safety is greatly compromised by heavy vehicles hogging the extreme right lane moving very slowly thereby forcing 'faster' vehicles to cut lanes to overtake them from the left thereby greatly increasing the chance of accidents. This menace has to be addressed quickly with high priority. One more thing, why can't heavy vehicles be banned from using select highways on weekends to enable leisure tourists with families travel safely? 
1 0 To reduce or stop trafficking 1. reduce poverty 2. we all should increase sense of moral responsibility 3. Our police to be free to take action (they are mostly influenced by monetary reason or powerful personnel) 4. find and stop money flow obtained by trafficking. 5. Lastly what i and many other think (may be wrong) that what all it happens can't happen without the help of of our law makers and law keepers. so their morals needs to refrained and the hunger of money to be stopped.

0 0 Trafficked individuals may be treated as disposable possessions without much attention given to their mental or physical health. Accordingly, some of the health problems that may be evident in a victim include: Malnutrition, dehydration or poor personal hygiene Sexually transmitted diseases Signs of rape or sexual abuse Bruising, broken bones, or other signs of untreated medical problems Critical illnesses including diabetes, cancer or heart disease Post-traumatic stress 
1 0 Vast number of Childrens' homes have come up in the recent past particularly in Southern India, post-tsunami. These seem unregulated and have scope for abuse such as trafficking. Set up a system that will make the running of these transparent. E.g. mandatory corporate sponsorship as part of CSR, mandatory enrolment of these kids in govt schools, social audits, peevention of foreigners from entering these homes/ directly donating (to protect from international child abuse rings) etc 
0 0 Dear PM, Aadhar card concept is very usefull & multi-purpose tool; apart from its known & projected uses, it can also be used for keeping complete (and multi-use) record of our Human Resources. As on this forum Mr. Parthsarathi S. has suggested that we shouuld  keep record of our unemployed youth, I think that the record of skills and other working capacities of all adults should be collected-maintained with their UIDno.for better use of their copetencies for nation-development & control crimes 
1 0 Don't we have enough Agencies already? Does it solve this problem.

1 0 I believe that there be mandatory medical security for all citizens so that one does not die for lack of medical facilities which very much hpns at present, govt can at least start immediately with d mandatory MEDICLAIM for a sum of Rs 50 k/1 lac for the new born child, to be given at d time of applying for birth certificate of d child and linked with Aadhar no of the mother so that d forge certificates cannot be issued. Hope it come to d notice of PM sir and 1 does not die of lack of medicine 
1 0 Everywhere I can see ladies begging on the roads with infants & Babies. It is obvious by seeing them and child that the child has been kidnapped as they look rich and health in initial days. M.G.Road Metro station of Gurgaon has more number of children like this.

Why can't this government take strict action against this.PLZ 
1 0 this is huge task as a nation we have.the root cause is gender imbalance in society and illiteracy.we need to address both this issue comprehensively.as  a society we need comprehensive laws against gender imbalance.we strongly need 50 % reservations in parliament and state  assemblies for woman very urgently. simultaneously it is important to have 50 % reservations in educational institutions and  jobs for women every level.

0 0 Recently read a news item regarding linking of PAN number when applying for Director Identification number. It is known that every company hat is incorporated is required to obtain PAN number before it can start operation which starts with opening of bank account. Why cannot a promoter applying for company can simultaneously apply for PAN so that he along with incorporation certificate gets PAN. This can save time by at least seven to ten days of his activity going operational 
1 0 time has come to transfer law and order from state list to concurrent list, as most of the human trafficking crimes are national and international in nature and required multi disciplinary action. dont create any fresh government body, just strengthen and modify existing bodies and laws

1 0 I belong to Jabalpur, MP & i have been working out of Pune for last 10 yrs. Why is it so difficult to develop same kind of IT companies set-up as in Pune. If C.B Naidu can do it for Hyderabad (where world's best IT companies are based) why can't S.S Chouhan can do it for Indore or Jabalpur. No one wants to stay away from their families. Its just that we don;t have enough jobs in MP we have to go out. We studied in MP, are proud of MP, but can't just work in MP. Is this logical?? We need IT in MP 
1 0 PM sir, the most important issue is how we can develope patriotism in our country. Most of us are self centered and spoiling country's unity and enhancing discrimination. I feel everything will settle if youths are compulsorily made to serve our armed forces for at least two years like in some of the other countries. The best out of them may continue in the service and others can live their lives as they want. Think over it, make our youths better citizens before any other opportunities.

SAVE THE SEAFARERS, WE SERVE THE COUNTRY After so much of professional pressure it's really ridiculous behaviour on the part of GOVT servicemen 
2 0 REVAMPING PROCESS OF APPOINTMENT FOR IAS, IPS, ETC. - There have been discussions from quite a few yrs that many IIT, MBBS & other technically qualified people join UPSC Administrative Services thus defeating the very purpose of getting such qualifications. Govt. spend a lot of money on those educations which remain more or less unutilised. My suggestion- A separate Stream Bachelor of Administration for 3-4 yrs may be started after +2 level to give a choice to all students to go to any stream. 
2 0 Proper vending zone for the street hawkers/ vendors. It has been observed in several parts of Delhi that street vendors start their business on a road, which not only creates traffic jam but also for this they finally occupy that place which is basicaly for the purpose of the footpaths. It not only consumes more petroleum products but also creates noise and air pollution. It can be ruled out that there may be chance of involvement of cops in unethical act. In my view this is the right to settle 
2 0 Joint efforts of state and center are needed to stop human trafficking. A portal should be developed where anybody could report the missing or kidnapped person of his family with the details of name,father's name,address, identity, last stay or place and wearing etc.A special cell(HPTA) at center should co-ordinate the matters with states .Both the origin and destination places police should do prime investigating and submit report on portal along with unknown death/murder records of country.

0 0 In India max people do not follows the traffic rules and always they are in hurry to reach their destination.

There must be common rule for all Indian except special cases.... Talking will not solve this problem but action could..,.

1 0 human trafficking is for three cause 1. money seeking 2.  organ replacement 3. for brothels. So as a conclusion all  type of people are involved in this , police, mops underworld,  doctors for money , rich man for healthy life and fresh organ . and remaining all for evil deed . so to stop these is the only way  to stop is by cultivating good habits in childhood by better education system . as system to add " Naitik shiksa " in syllabus

1 0 Declining sex ratio is the major root cause of human trafficking. Govt can tie up with social shows like satyamev jayate and crime patrol to spread the awareness about human trafficking. National level planing is the need of the hour. 
1 0 Sir The main reason behind all this is illeteracy which comes out from poverty,so we should first focus on removing poverty then only this problem can be solved because a rich and literate man cannot be the victim of this problem. 
0 0 Human Trafficking Prevention Agency is real need of hour in rural India where Indias villages are facing crisis due to large scale female child trafficking as it will screw gender ratio further. 
0 0 The transgender community in India is today maligned and is forced to interact with criminal elements closely associated with trafficking etc. Create a post of SPO for transgenders and draft them as eyes and ears of police and intelligence. This will give them a salary and dignity, and make them valuable contributors to society and also help curb trafficking 
1 0 Create a wing within police organisations, preferably composed of women, that does random audits of all orphanages. Support this with a system of specifying strict criteria to set up and operate orphanages e.g. who is permitted to set them up, are there minimum qualifications, absence of criminal record, compulsory funding by a corporate CSR fund as well as a Govt body (and not just NGO funds) to force transparency etc. This will minimise risk of orphanages being used for child trafficking. 
1 0 1.form rapid action force to tackle HT 2. easily accessible service and information forum for informing and getting the service of HTPA 3.relevant and correct information about HT ,should be encouraged with prizes 
1 0 ....... Prostitution , it has been there in ancient India (mentioned in Artha Shahstra). Which will put curb on trafficking of women and children in flesh trade. 3. The social Justice Department may be guided to take a proper count on beggars to stop maffias inn these area and child trafficking. 4. Stringent laws against trafficking. 5. awareness among people about human trafficking so that they don't become easy prey of employment agencies. 6. Proper employment registration by govt. bodies 
1 0 Sir, any agency can curb this abhorrent practise only transiently. The root cause of this menace, lack of employment, burgeoning population, stagnant economy, have to be addressed. A dedicated helpline, women police stations, a task force under the ministry for women & children, along with the national & state human rights organisations can be mandated to take necessary actions with input from local police intelligence. These women & children need to be effectively rehabilitated / counselled.

1 0 I have the following suggestions: 1) Toll Free Help Line 2) Incentives to Informers 3) Human trafficking DSP/Cell at District Police HQ 4) Fast Track court 5) advt on TV channels 6) Public Hearings 7) Community Police at PRI/ULB levels 8) Encourage patnership with indian railways and state bus associations 9) participation of NGOs/PRIs/ULBs to form girls-self-defence clubs.. 10) Data base at district level 
1 0 Domestic Human Trafficking: Train & use crime prevention sleeper cells in cities/industrial areas to alert about possible child/women trafficking. Special & secret cell in each city to monitor NGOs & Religious orgs, becuz its a organized crime, mostly running under shadow of such organizations. International human trafficking: Slowly & steadily, make Aadhar-linked Biometric verification mandatory for international exits/entry of Indian citizens. 
1 0 we have to make strict rules against the sex houses. Also i believe as a prevention we need to make the society strong enough to fight for themselves, especially girls. we need them all to learn some form to martial arts or self defence techniques, which i believe we can start at schools and orphanage levels as orphanages are more exploited than other places. make it a complusion to teach defence techniques to all at student level itself 
1 0 TO STOP THIS GET 4 RULES 1.GET THE LAW REGARDING THE SEX HOUSES 2.ERADICATE CHILD LABOUR 3.INDIFFERENCES BETWEEN RICH AND POOR 4.PUNISHMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO DO THIS THE BROKERS AND THE PERSON BEHIND THEM UN FORTUNATELY LAWS ARE THERE BUT DOESNT WORK AS THE PEOPLE WHO MUST DO THEY WORK ARE NOT DOING IT TRAFFICKING IS DONE FOR SEX HOME WORK DRUGS BAN THE SEX WEBSITES WORKER AS HELPER MUST BE REGISTERED DRUGS MUST BE BANNED IMPLEMENT THE RULE OF GIVING THE HISTORY OF PEOPLE GOING ABOARD FULLY

0 0 Yes we do see humantfficking but none of us have a right place where we can complaint because if we think we will go and to complaint to the police its a joke they are already a part of it at a big scale . Even today i know places where its happening but i cannot do anaything i know lot of places but of no use . Who would listen and take actions within time ?. 
0 0 The divisive politics has its roots in our system, and as such, it will require overhauling the system itself, if we are interested in destroying the evil- lock, stock and barrel. Blaming the individual politicians or the political parties for the evil is tantamount to not seeing the wood for the trees; may prove counterproductive. 
0 0 Run it by women only. Women are far more sensitive to such issues. 
0 0 What they call "GM(Genetically Modified) Food Stuff", should, in fact, be called,"GC(Genetically Corrupted) Food Stuff". Laboratory Experiments for developing them shd be banned forthwith. 
0 0 Since the tenure of all the incumbents holding political posts is for a strictly limited term, the question of formation of communities of professional politicians, with vested interests in the Govt.- solely responsible for ever increasing corruption- does not arise in democracies governed by egalitarian system of governance.Quick-fix solutions and cosmetic changes,doled out to tackle the monster of corruption in our country only go to aggravate the malady.They are worse than the disease.. 
0 0 Pensioner-beneficiaries of CGHS retiring from autonomous bodies like CSIR are not treated at par with their counterpart retired from purely government service-particularly in the matter of grant of credit facilities- facility of cashless transactions in obtaining medical treatment in the CGHS private empanelled hospitals, healthcare centres, nursing homes etc. Simmering discontentment among this section of CGHS pensioner beneficiaries is quite justified. 
0 0 HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS MOST DANGEROUS CRIME EVER IT IS BIGGER THEN THE MURDER SUGESATIONS TO SOP HUMAN TRAFACKING ARE: 1.MAJOR REASON FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS AN OPEN MONEY FIRSTLY EVERY TRANSACTIONS ABOVE TEN THOUSANDS MUST BE THROUGH CHEQUE OR THROUGH CARD 2.STOP Rs 500 AND Rs 1000 RUPEE NOTES 3.ONLINE,BY TOLL FREE NUMBER COMPLAINT REGISTRATION SYSTEM TO BE LAUNCHED AND COMPLAINT PERSON IDENTIFICATION TO BE KEEP SECREAT 4. 
0 0 There shd b very strict law against the practice of more than one person of a group of blood relations and/or belonging to a single family, at the same time, holding one or the other political post either in d govt. or in any political party. The practice degenerates into sort of whole time family business- a sure recipe for blatant corruption, and corrupt practices capable of destroying the very fabric of democracy. 
0 0 In order to b really effective, Public Grievance Officer for  a Govt. Dept., shd not be below the rank of Additional Secretary to the Govt. with powers to call for the files, and concerned officers for discussion, hold enquiry into a matter or direct an officer not below the rank of Jt. Secretary to the Govt. for the purpose. S/he should belong to a separate, distinct cadre by the same name to be created in the Ministry of Personnel etc., and allotted Departments for settling pension etc. 
0 0 All Octogenarian pensioner-beneficiaries of CGHS and their spouses (irrespective of their age), must be placed in the Private Ward category entitling them to Private Ward facilities in all the Govt. and CGHS empaneled Private Hospitals, nursing homes etc. 
0 0 The Dept. of Pensioners’ Welfare, Ministry of Personnel etc. under the charge of Hon,ble Prime Minister, does not entertain the pension-related grievances of those retiring from Central Autonomous Bodies, Central Universities whose Pension-related grievances addressed to the Ministry are routinely transferred to the concerned Autonomous Body authorities by the Ministry, absolutely without doing anything about them.  The Dept. of Pensioners’ Welfare, Ministry of Personnel etc., should be revamped 
0 0 Human trafficking is the second most profitable illegal industry in the world . In our country if we talk about the basic is very simple as we everyday see people who look forced for these things but the biggest point is if i want to complaint about this where i should go . If i go to police they wont bother cause they are the partners in crime . I every day see illegal things being sold almost outside a police staion in the most central place of delhi . So why would human traffiking be stopped 
1 0 Most of the poeple issues can be solved if the corporator is held responsible for his work. The issues in any community should be discussed and address by corporator (along with current roles they are playing). They should meet their ward people, understand the issues and discuss with Govt.  Corporators should have a term of only 1 year - and depending on performance they should be allowed to continue. Their work should be published in a full page in newspaper, so we know what they have done 
1 0 One of the major problems which I see in developed layouts in Blore, is about road maintenance 1) House owner takes water connection 2) For a function, they install a shamiyana Similarly there are many non-govt people who damage the road. Actually if we wait for Govt to fix it, it takes very long time. Govt should allow individuals to fix roads on their expense as per govt norms. People are ready to repair on their own expense, but can't tar as the process is difficult to follow. 
1 0 Start a local human trafficking task force.by giving trainingpolice staff on how to identify the indicators of human trafficking and assist victims.Encourage your local schools to partner with students and include the issue of modern day slavery in their curriculum. As a parent, educator, or school administrator, be aware of how traffickers target school aged children.start a grassroots anti-trafficking coalition.Distribute public awareness materials by govt. 
0 0 Human Trafficking can be stopped by making an amendment in Article 19. Freedom of Speech and Expression needs to be checked in modern day light. Expression by the medium of films have supported human trafficking. In India films should be made on the impacts of drugs, sale of girls topics of public concern, because the films have the power to arouse the sentiments of the viewers. Human Trafficking can also be controlled by adopting the policy of 'love thy neighbor'. 
1 0 Human Trafficking is a sin, but the antisocial elements involved in this trade have no value for humanity. The reasons are obvious, money, lust, greed, sex and violence. It is easy to use and sell any human body to wipe sin traces. This can be stopped either by engaging all citizens of the country in farming sector or military. Compulsory military training for all citizens and 5 years  service in army will help in controlling the trafficking to great extent. 
0 0 Dear Sir Please introduce spiritual education - not religious from a young age. Yoga is being promoted aggressively but children should understand it's far beyond incredible acrobatics and body twisting postures.

0 0 it is practically impossible to guard all schools and all public places in India which is having a huge population  what best we can do is to work for religious harmony, taking disciplinary actiion  on hate mongers whether they are hindu  and christian, sikhs or muslims.  crpc 402 should include this with non bailable condition and media should work for religious harmony to create a mass awareness

And this will encourage them to indulge in different sports.

0 0 MyGov is an immensely useful idea to tap the energy, initiative and minds of millions of citizens of the country to develop India. It can only come from a government that has the welfare of the country and its citizens at heart rather than just a desire to enjoy and exploit the fruits of power. The latter kinds of governments build walls of silence, bureaucracy and superiority between them and the citizens rather than engagement as Mygov is doing. 
2 0 Please this is INDIA not Foreign . We have a different culture here so why such things are not stopped. "Aakhir kab tak aisey chalega" ?  And moreover these films are given the title of adult films then why are they shown on television ? If children see these type of movies then what ? This is how INDIA will grow with dirty things in it. Sir please it is a request from me do something to stop this. I am sure with this rape issues will stop. Plz do something. Please some one bring CHANGE.

3 0 Hello sir i want to say that its my request that first you should pay heed towards the rape issues which are happenning so frequently in our country.

Sir i want to tell you that attention should be given on the portrayal of women in films. We are responsible for this.I am 90% sure this will at many extent solve this issue

2 0 It is my suggestion to government that there should be a cap on the fees charged by the private schools and gradually the system of government school must be improve and like in the foreign countries education till 12th standard will became free for all the citizens of India in government schools as well as in private schools this will help for education for every child of india. This will help  us in our nation building and improve the future of each and every child.

0 0 Rupee is falling.  The falling rupee is not good for the country.  It will negatively affect return on investment in dollar terms and scare away investors.

1 0 Sir, need of the time requires drastic changes in police working as well as drastic changes in judicial process otherwise crimes will increase day by day. So called stringent laws do'nt make  any sense if criminals are not punished finally. Recent spurt in rape cases has proved this. Candle march and peace march will not do anything. Changes are being made everywhere, then why not in judicial process. 
0 0 Directly coming to point , woukd like to say that fast track court are also useless. Crime like nirbhaya kaand and recent ubet taki rape case issues must b solved quikly. Crimes in which culprit is arrested and crime is known by whole nation thn its usless to run cases for long yrs... for such cases time limit must b framed. Even for gov thrs time limit of 5 years thn y noy for solving crime cases. If its transfrd to fast track thn 3 months should b givn for solution. 
1 0 Sir, Its about the crimes & punishments given its a shame that even after two years of nirbhaya rape case the criminals are still alive, for crimes like rapes & terrorism the punishments should be given faster and the punishment should be death penalty nothing less, people supporting ISIS in India should be stopped at the earliest or the results would be terrifying 
1 0 अगर हमारे चुने हुए प्रत्यासी और पोलिस चाह ले तो किसी की क्या मज़ाल जो गलत काम कर सके। पर क्या करे हम भी किनसे उम्मीद रख रहे हैं। उनसे जिनको समाज की भलाई की जिम्मेदारी दी गयी और उन्होंने उसे ही गन्दा कर दिया। तो ऐसे में human trafficking रोकना है तो 3 लोगो आगे आना पड़ेगा-elected representative, police and society. Fir koi galat kar ke dikhaye. Challenge hai use meri taraf se. 
1 0 और जब वो इस चालक दुनिया से बेखबर गरीब बाहर जायेगा तो ये चालाक लोग उसका exploitation करेंगे या उसे बेच देंगे या हमेसा के लिए बंधक बना लेंगे। और साहब मजे की बात ये है की ये वोट लेने वाले,सत्ता के भूखे कभी इसकी खबर नही लेंगे। क्यूँ? क्या सांसद और विधायक बनना ही उनका मकसद है ,अच्छा ठीक है आप बन गए तो क्या अब राजधानी में ही हमेसा रहना है बँगले में या कभी देखने भी जाओगे की जिस जनता ने मुझे जिताया है वो कैसी है। नही कभी नही। क्यों? क्योंकि अब आप बहुत बड़े आदमी बन गए न। आम आदमी थोड़े न रह गए। 
1 0 And if we talk about any tribal region then definitely elected representative is the one to be blamed. Because problem of trafficking arises because of underdevelopment of region which compell them to leave their society in search of work. Huge amount of money has been provided via various schemes. Where had all these money gone. इतने पैसे खर्च करने के बाद भी वो इतने गरीब क्यों हैं। क्योंकि वो गरीब नही रहेंगे तो चुनावी मुद्दा कहा से तैयार होगा। to garib job ki talash me bahar jayega hi. 
0 0 A gram sabha choose its head who has responsibility to look after the arising issues about everything whether it is development, employment, security issue,irrigation or whatever be it, he is the man to be approached. He should make sure the development, employment, security of his village. So this can be one way to check on human trafficking because every citizen is enrolled which he belongs to a particular basic unit of nation. So area head is responsible to ensure his/her existence. 
1 0 There is only one solution for this... Just strict the rules. Just watch the APARICHITHUDU movie. Then you will understand it. People should fear to do mistakes, if you strict the rules. 
1 0 I am more concerned about the developing India where religion is taking important roll. Most of the application forms either for school /college admission or for jobs, one has to indicate the religion. Why this is required to be indicated.  In the initial stage itself we separate the people by caste. Castism should be totally abolished.  We are Indians / Hindusthanis first and my name is my identity which should not be linked to any religion.The Govt should concentrate on on India's development 
0 0 Human trafficking is the modern form of slavery, with illegal smuggling and trading of people, for forced labor or sexual exploitation. Trafficking is officially defined as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons by means of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, or abuse of power of a position of vulnerability for the purpose of exploitation. Human trafficking is not synonymous with forced migration or smuggling.

1 0 And most painful thought is.. neither you are corrupt nor any work (national interest) is progressing.

Looks like passengers and staff life has been compromised as more than 50 times either the glass ceiling / wall tiles / gates etc come crashing down resulting in waste of money. It is only a matter of time before a big casualty strikes resulting in more loss of lives.
