We should concentrate on each drop of water
1 ) Rain water harvesting
2) small dams on rivers after each 10 km
3) Big dams after each 100 kms.
4) connecting each dams with other river dams by pipe line for avoiding land problems and water can be transferred from both directions.
5) connecting all of the big revers like this in India.
One day water should transferred from Kerala to J & K as well as Asam to Rajastan and vice versa.

It is observed that people build big houses occuping each corner of the plot without leaving required space for vehicles of the occupants.

For casting our votes,there is no criteria to ensure that, those who r voting r eligible to vote except that one has to be 18+ to vote So, if there is a exam (comprising of political awareness,G.K,logical thinking) to ensure that voters really know what purpose they r serving,this will be really helpful for our mission to education for all, as this exam will break down this vote bank politics, n politicians will have to make people educated if they want votes. + exams for our leaders too:)

Dear Sir...
I suggest you to speak especially on Skill development and Job creation through small startups. Through speech, you can encourage and give some confidence to the people of our Nation to startup something & create jobs/feed others. Most of the people having enough money/knowledge can do that, but they may not due to lack of confidence.
By the way, Happy Independence Day to you & All in advance.
Thanks & Regards,

One thing I would like to suggest is history to be correctly written in school textbooks, there is no need to bifurcate society by its cast/religion either in education or opportunities.We need corruption free India where politicians live like a common man.Last but not the least Modi has to live with his words on corruption and red tape.Managerial failure in administration looks evident,that should vanish.Law should ban conversion.

0 0 Respected PM sir namasthe, my suggestions for independence day speech is 1.compulsory national service in uniformed servicesfor all citizens above 18 should be made a statutory requirement like in singapore, which will foster nationalism in them 2.History of india should be compulsorily shown in the form of movies to the children regularly in addition to the history books in all schools to increase patriotism, stress on places like jallianwalla bagh, cellular jail, natinal war memorial etc.

1 0 1. Why is  not a mass rapid transport system in Gurugram? Especially have mass rapid transport eg train along highways in urban areas including NCR.
2. Water logging & traffic jams are due to vanishing water bodies.
3. Urban planning not being publicly debated.

4. Have hard shoulder like UK highways where left track is emerg'y.

Recently,we witnessed few cases where passengers tweeted to Hon'ble Railway Minister seeking help against teasing & harassment and timely helped was provided to the victims which is very much appreciated. keeping in view such increasing eve-teasing, harassment & robbery activities, I suggest to provide contact nos. of security staff in PNR/tickets itself. Alternatively, alarms/chains like pulling chains can be installed in trains so that passenger can directly contact to staff.

0 0 Dear PM Modiji, could you please speak on how your government is planning to deal with the issue of recurring annual floods for the affected areas? One suggestion I have for this is to maintain open green areas on outskirts of the cities. Limit the areas of the cities all across India and do not permit any real estate constructions of offices or residences or any other commercial estates outside the city limits. Those open areas can be covered by planting trees and grasslands.

Govt should not just give emphasis on completion of work/projects,they should give equal emphasis on quality of work done..an example would be quality of roads which constructed.
Govt should give subsidy to public transportation and make efforts to strngthen it,it would automatically reduce problem of traffic jams,pollution and we shall save fuel.
Govt should provide dustbins and well maintained public toilets both for men/women alongside the roads/highway's,as part of swach Bharat.

5) Stop asking to fill up forms for personal details, instead just get the biometrics of the person availing the service and retrieve all the information from the AADHAR database.
6) Tell the British time courts in India to start working in highly efficient way and deliver justice in Time. NOTE: Justice Delayed is Justice Denied.
7) Please ask the state governments to give generous salaries & good houses to the state policemen & their families.

Since independence, it has been put into practice by every political disposition to name schemes after their ideological figures. We have dozens of objects of national importance named after very few individuals which is disproportionate to their contribution.People like A.P.J Abdul Kalam, Verghese Kurian don't have a single important scheme, monument under their name. You can change that.

0 0 I am having two points that should be included in speech-
1) education system (rather than quantity, quality should be there) For Example- with  theoretical education ,there should be equal importance to practical education.
2) laws in India (there should be some specific duration when a new law is going to create that laws should be re-analyse after specific duration is there need of law now or not. for example reservation system should be based on the basis of economic condition.
0 0 Sir,Your idea itself can be extended to become greatest idea for health care management.You have mentioned in man kid bath about gynaecologist to examine for 1 day of month free anti natal check up.If you can make it compulsory for every govt employee and tax paying citizen to pay their 1day salary of month for their own health insurance.The money from such a scheme can be easily calculated and some free health insurance can be given for poor people.Govt can spend more on preventive medicine.

मेरे घर जो बाई काम करती है वह मेरी माँ से प्रतिदिन बोलती है कि उसके बच्चे कभी बिस्कुट कभी रोटी अचार खाकर सो जाते हैं??
आख़िर महँगाई कब तक कम होगी ?

0 0 Dear Sir,
My suggestion is on Women safety:
We come across cases of rape/attempt to rape etc everyday. After appx 70 years of independence, let's ensure that our females are safe wherever they are. I request for giving strict punishment to the accused of rape/attempt to rape, so that it becomes deterrent for others. Like verdict in all rape cases must be given in 180 days of filing FIR. Life sentence to be given to rape accused. For false complain of rape the complainant be life imprisonment
0 0 Time is ripe to spell out the realistic action to save Kashmir from alienation.
For the past one year spent more time in defending itself from onslaught of opposition parties and public out cry on various mistakes and errors committed by ministers, mps and the party workers.

1. Farmer are forced to  sell their heard earned agricultural  produces at lowest price (wholesale rate) and are made to buy all their needs at highest price(retail rate )which is quite reverse to that of Industrialist.There is no justice.Let Government fix up or allow them to fix up reasonable minimum price considering the production cost with some profit to retain them & their generation in villages/ farming.

1.	Ask People to grow greenery of any sort Tulasi etc on the walls / compound walls ( V or U shape on the top of the wall to hold Mud for plantation) to address impact of deforestation at least to some extent. We can call it “WOW”. Wealth on walls as green leaf is nothing but a source of Oxygen and Health/ Wealth to people. The estimated  5000 square KM + area on the walls which is unutilized will help improve national environment., especially in Cities and Apartments

0 0 sir, high time... considering the uncomfortable minority you have in the Rajya sabha, you consider taking mandates directly from People (Janadesh) to be held on a National basis (similar to the General elections). Janadesh obviously supersedes the Constitution, both the houses of Parliaments and the Supreme court. Alone Janadesh (while the time is still available) can solve various vexed issues such as Ram Mandir Construction, Scrapping of Art 370, enforcing common civil law for all etc.

On this Independence Day , a strong message should be sent to the oppositions and the intellectuals..
Being of general category , I want you to declare some special scheme or some sort of surprise for the HARIJANS . Because its very crucial for the U.P Elections because oppositions are trying to brainwash their minds by spreading rumours...
But I Know this Government is only for the development of India and its people specially the lower class.

1.Educational System of our Nation is required to be unified and it should be bring out at control of Central ministry.The free and quality based education must be given for all the young Indian's .There will be a Single Syllabus that must be followed by the whole state in India upto Higher Secondary Level of Education ,with giving prime importance for the mother tounge.

0 0 After watching Rio olympic-2016, I am very upset. such big population country have no sport talent or other problem. in my point of view,We have plenty of talent but due to lac of proper training, not get good talent who compete very well in this type event. It required to add one sport subject mandatory in education system from third standard. so child talent come out in early age. So, we provide proper training and guidance from beginning. By this we can get good talent.

My suggestion is that the MRP of Cancer medicines should be reduced and brought near to thier cost.
Hospitals sell these medicines to patients at thier MRP.
Though they are available at 60- 70% discount in outside market, but hospitals donot allow patients to buy it from ouside market and rather sell these to patients at MRP.
If MRP is reduced to their nearby cost, then financial burden on family of cancer patients would reduce by minimum 50%.

1) Pension for retired and V.R.S holders who worked in public sector companies are getting very less. They are getting  Rs. 1000/- or even less amount monthly under 1995 scheme. About 32 Lakhs of people will be benefited. This is to be revised. Recently you are revised to central govt. retired workers pension. This is excellent.
This is for 70th Independence day.
Thanks a lot.
Kind Regards,
S.Shetty.
0 0 प्रणाम। सभी जानते हैं कि हमारी सेना के जवान अपनी जान देकर देश की रक्षा में जुटे है पर वे ड्यूटी करते समय अपने ही परिवार की मुसीबत में मदद नही कर पाते।सभी देशवासी उनकी मदद भी करना चाहते हैं।
आप अगर निवेदन करे तो हर राज्य में देशप्रेमी लोगो की संस्था बने जो समाचार मिलने के साथ ही जरूरत मन्द सैनिक परिवार की मदद को पहुँच जाए।इसके लिए फंड हम खुद ही जुटा लेंगे ऐसा मुझे बिस्वास है।अगर ऐसा हुआ तो हमारे फौजी भाई निश्चित होकर देश सेवा कर सकेंगे।
0 0 Honourable PM sir,(1)EDUCATION(2)HEALTH(3)FOOD these are primary NEEDS to any man on this earth.kindly give more priority to these needs in your gov plans and programmes.I think Education can be strengthened by various plans like sarva shiksha abhiyan and midday meal programme and,Health by good gov services and food by increasing products and strong support to FARMERS.THANKING YOU SIR
0 0 1) Please clearly mention the progress you made on the things you announced in 2014&15.
2) Please mention your plans for liberalizing higher education. India to be a knowledge hub, we need great universities.
0 0 Respected Sir,
When we compare India with USA we find that in USA citizens are disciplined,abide by law,care for environment-cleanliness.There are heavy penalties for breaking the rules such as traffic.Here main hurdle in development are politicians who think & behave as if they are above law.Please discipline your politicians first to set an example for  the  people.There is proverb "As the king so are the subjects" This is also said by GOD SHRI KRISHNA in Madbhagwadgita.
0 0 Respected Sir,
To make new generation  disciplined, free from bad habits like smoking, tobacco chewing, wine etc NCC should be made compulsory  across India  from 5th standard  to college.  This wil enable us to have strong well trained , disciplined  young  indian citizens force to support  the army in the event of  war or terrorists attacks. Money spent for this purpose will never fail. Chandravadan Shah Bhuj

2.Just introduce the nation with the ARTHKRANTI TAXATION  SYATEM so that the corruption will be definitely leave the system.
And make people think about it....

In  order to discourage  Public Sector  Banks  employees  frequently  going on strike,  today bank employees  only 1 day LWP  is made in case of strike. Instead,   it should be doubled on every strike. For example, one time strike 1 day   LWP, second time strike 2 day LWP, third time strike  4 day LWP, fourth time strike  8 day LWP and so on.  Frequent strikes  by bank employees cause  untold hardship to general  public and damage to our economy.Chandravadan Shah Bhuj
0 0 Dear PMji,
One of the main problems our nation facing is the issue of corruption.Even though your government has taken several steps, every citizen knows that it is not eradicated completely.In this digital India where we are using mobile phones for our needs, I request you to start a project where a citizen can send the videos/photos/audio clippings anonymously about the corruption using his mobile.This can be setup in every central/autonomous/state govt.office which uses the central fund.

Lakhs of flats are lying vacant and people want them on rent. But if we want the rents to go cheap and reasonable...provide quick action by law to get the flat vacated just by showing the documents of ownership to police.
Time has come to provide police and legal backing to flat owners to get their flat vacated .
This will BRING THE RENTS DOWN GREATLY.

0 0 Our country need a proper management system. As some of our states remain continuously in drought condition while the other areas face the problems of flood.There should be some linking system for rivers of various states and areas which can solve problems of floods and droughts.
0 0 Sir,
This is a humble request to kindly ban smoking at public places because passive smoking causes more harm to the non-smokers.It is more important to ban smoking instead of banning chewing tobacco.
0 0 Some more suggestions to our PM for better health reforms
1-Bio Medical Waste at present it's a very big problem in many States bio Medical waste are transport for distortion it's very dangerous for human health can Govt arrange facility to destroy this waste in site the hospital premises so it will be easy and save for human life advance technology and latest Equipments are available for this purpose at present we use inslaters it's old and unsafe technology please stop these inslater.
0 0 Every Voter & Adhar card members must pay @ Rs. 10/- per year as a stake holder of our loving country. It will not only generate huge revenue but also 1000/365 @2.75 paisa per day will give them the sense of ownership of this country, n people will avoid destroying or prevent destroying public facilities which they getting free or at negligible cost.
0 0 Respected Modiji,I am very delightful of all your schemes for the nation.I suppose our nation would stand front of all the countries if it is free from violence, especially against women.It would be so beneficial if your talk includes this as you are a heartthrob to most of today's Indian youngsters and they may obey your advice. Thank youji.

Use and throw के बदले हम अपने परम्परागत साधनो का उपयोग करे तो इस से एक साथ दो काम होंगे, एक तो कचरा नहीं फैलेगा, दूसरा रोजगार का सर्जन होगा,example सूरत में कपडे का कचरा निकलता हे यदि इस कपडे की कतरन को जोड़ कर उस की छोटी बड़ी थेलिये बना दी जाय,कई सामान्य लोगो को घर बेठे रोजगार मिलेगा,साथ ही इसका उपयोग बढ़ेगा जब प्लास्टिक का कचरा कम होगा।।

0 0 Women law namely the infamous 498A,the antidowry harassment law IPC is being misused. Many disgruntled wives are filing false cases. They treat this as a tool to harass the husbands family and to extract huge sums as settlement money. Time and energy of police is being wasted in investigating these false cases. Police know that these are false cases but being afraid they file chargesheet. Most results in acquittal but precious 5 to 10 years are gone in life and also reults in loss of reputation.

0 0 As we have three funds in india consolidated,contingency and Public account.I want to suggest make one more fund "Nagrik" fund.In this fund there will be money of charity that citizen want to give to govt.Sir we indians have more desire to give charity rather than tax.Indian will give without hesitation charity of 1000 but will think three times before giving tax of 100.So I want to suggest that make one account number Public for charity.Sir crore of rupee will get collected.
0 0 Dear sir,
Please use this ocassion to reinvent the emotion of freedom struggle and to call upon our brotherhood to stop malign the fellow indian on the basis of caste and join together to through away the elements encouraging divide and rule policy and using the religion as a tool to attain the political gains
0 0 Dear Priminister sir
Housing societies are an example of cleanliness and beauty. That is not because different Indian nationals live there !! It is because residents have to give contribution for maintenance to resident association by law.
But Alas!! There is no such law to provide legal status to residential colonies .
If these resident associations of various colonies are provided legal backing to collect contributions...Then you will see colonies being maintained....properly.
Thanks

0 0 Sir, Happy Independence Day Wishes. Most Engineering graduates in the country are unemployable as of now. To improve the employability of engineering graduates, they need to be trained in the employable skill sets. To train them, we need good teachers. But now teaching is lucrative only if you have Ph.D degree. Otherwise, they get a meagre salary. But now many teachers have done Ph.D by purchasing them. Hence, my earnest request you not to make Ph.D compulsory for the teachers.
0 0 Involve key technological institutes(IITs) in waste management particularly of non-degradable waste recycling like plastic. Also waste should be segregated to separate industrial waste, mobile batteries, laptop computer hardware waste and means of proper disposal of such wastes should be taught to common people.

India speaks almost 800 languages belonging to 4 different stocks - Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Autro-asiatic and Sino-Tibetan. My suggestion is that the Union Govt. could name its schemes in different languages - Say one Scheme could be named in Manipuri, one in Dogri, another in Tamil and so on. This, I feel will help us celebrate our diversity and also unite us even stronger.
Thank You.

1.India is demanding expansion of UNO & also permanent position.
My question is why don't we expand Loksabha according to our population.?
Why the moratorium on new age politicians till 2026.?
2.Lakhs of Indians in their productivity age are migrating to others countries. This is the rootcause for India's under development.
So what are the strategies adopted by the Government to avoid this brain drain ?

0 0 Hon'ble PM Sir, I will be completing 69 year age on 15 August 2016. I never bowed before corruption during my life for which I paid the price. The corruption can only to crushed by taking harsh as well as hard action study the case of Singapore where in 1959 Hon'ble Mr Lee Kaun Yew soon after taking charge shot dead the officials against whom the corruption charge established and sent other officials in JAIL against whom inquiry in NEEDED. The nation was expecting such action from YOU SIR.
0 0 I would suggest to increase the moral of our Forces. They must feel that country is with them and their families. We never compare and come close to there sacrifices. PM Modiji please encourage the people to join Force. School should be advice to encourage and teach the patriotic history of our own country. People from countries like Japan, Israil,China etc.. have big respect for their country. They respect country call and give their everything for Country. We must feel proud on our country.
0 0 Every indian should have one ID card which shall replace Ration Card, Pan Card, Voter Card, Employee card. Property purchase more than a certain value should be recorded with the card. Govt can get details of the person by entering card number on the system. While issuing this card retina scan may be adopted. Every govt office would have the power to update this card. On death validity of this card may be lapsed by concerned authority. This may avoid infiltration & terrorism in India. Jai Hind
0 0 Honourable PM Sir, it is a great opportunity to citizen ti share his views. Independence is not defined as yet, it should be redefined. The style of functioning of public and govt becomes so opportunistic that no one is concerned about the patriotism which yields this D-day for us. So, it is my request to give more stress on Indian-ism for progress of country. Political mess becomes more dangerous in this regard. EVERY ONE PLAYS OWN CARD IN THE NAME OF FEMALE/MALE, DALITS AND OPPRESSED CLASS.
0 0 Dear Mr. Prime minister,
India cannot be in a more better place than today. Thanks for a great gov that is working and thriving and keeping India shine.

0 0 Sir, on Civil Service Day 21-04-2015 you expressed that ART (Accountability, Responsibility, Transparency) is essential for Good Governance / Administration. However, this did not appear to be quite effective. The Corruption in the Central Govt. Departments have not been checked. So, it is requested to re-iterate it on 15-08-2016 as part of Independent Day Speech. Also, the Central Govt. Employees (especially Bureaucrats) must follow proper rules, procedures and processes while dealing people.
0 0 please talk on 1.How harijans will be protected from higher caste Hindus and atrocities will be reduced by enforcing laws.
2.How income tax dept. will be modernized and corruption will be reduced from it.All transaction should be made thru email only. All interview with citizens should be video graphed and corrupt officers should be terminated. NRI and tax payer salaried persons should not get IT notice.Notice for past record of 8 yrs rules should be reduced to 5 years, as it is not practical.

If your government takes initiatives for improving employment oppurtunities for women in general (irrespective of caste) in higher education services by reducing minimum eligibility criteria in Master Degree (55% to 50%) for appearing UGC NET/SET exams for the post of Assistant Professor, then it would open more avenues for their employment oppurtunities.

0 0 Respected Sir,
In our country we are lacking of fear of our Law.Our law must be strengthen to make our system to work well.People have the confidence that they will get punishment after several years of crime.They can escape if they have a little political power.This is the main cause for All crimes in our country.I am in KSA,here people fear to commit crime/mistake because the fear of Law.Citizens should respect our Law and follow rules.

0 0 Dear Modi Jee...We have been lot of faith in you.But we are getting lot of announcement(programmes)from you, but reality execution is not happening.General public thinking is that most of the time you are not india(always in tour).This is for the suggestion to improve your government.

0 0 R/Sir, You should talk about true expansion of sports into rural villages as 'My village Sports /olympic' in a concrete and long term plan,especially where people of advasi tribes are leaving in a  mass.  Those are by birth hard worker and courageous  and archery their  in born sports. So in next olympic India will not wait with suspicious mind to open his account.
0 0 I think the pm can speak about crop insurance scheme. He must explain that farmers will get a compensation in case their crop fails if they invest in the insurance scheme. This will reduce farmer distress and farmer suicide. It also pools in people money to help each other through insurance.
0 0 Sir, Please declare on Independence Day that you will relieve the salaried employees from submitting IT Return & income tax will be deducted at source. That will eliminate manipulative documents preparation by the salaried employees. These paper works kill our productive hours only. Regards - Bishwajit Bhattacharjee
0 0 Respected Sir, So many natural calamities and disaster occur in many states. The state Govt wait and pray for that to happen and asks the central Govt to pay lakhs and crores rupees, The actions taken by state Govt are so slow that many people die and situations become more worst. Its my humble suggestion that the center Govt should constitute Disaster Management teams and should monitor and take actions themselves. Actions will be taken, no corruption and accountability will be there.
0 0 Sir, I think only education can change the country. An educated child can be an educated adult and quality education is the only area where our Govts rarely talks about. Primary education and Secondary level education is an area of politics in our country since 15.08.1947. Will PM Sir address this issue in his Independence Day speech.
0 0 Sir,
 1.Please encourage the farmers to adopt organic farming,this will decrease the burden of disease caused by harmful chemicals used during farming ,this will lead to a healthy India .
 2.Please encourage the use of jute and cotton which are bio-degradable instead of plastic as bag ,wrapper etc.
1 0 Sir, I feel that today’s  society and young generation are behind the soft / desk jobs only , they should be taught about the dignity and esteem about jobs related to physical work like farming etc.,
Sir, is it possible that Govt. will do the farming just like any other PSU industry and with due respect to you PERSONALITIES LIKE YOU WILL SPARE SOME TIME FOR SUCH JOBS.

देश में बेरोजगारी लगातार बढ़ रही है, युवक 16 से 18 घंटे दो दो जगह काम करने को मजबूर है। वेतन कब और कितना मिलेगा इसका कोई ठिकाना नहीं। यही कारण है कि उत्तर प्रदेश में सफाई कर्मी के लिए पीएचडी धारकों ने भी आवेदन किया। जनसंख्या बढ़ती है तो जरूरतें भी बढ़ती हैं तो फिर रोजगार के अवसर क्यों घट रहें है। संविदा नियुक्तियां युवाओं को भ्रमित कर रहीं है। इनसे आजादी दिलाएं पूरा देश कृतज्ञ हो जाएगा।

0 0 माननीय मोदी जी, केंद्र एवं राज्य  सरकार की नौकरियों हेतु आवेदन करने के लिए अधिक फीस ली जा रही है,जो नौकरी पाने के नैसर्गिक अधिकार का उल्लघन है, कई राज्य सरकार के विभागों ने तो अघोषित रूप से आवेदन शुल्क को भी विभाग की आमदानी के टारगेट जैसा बना लिया है,मान्यवर  बेरोज़गार को वर्ष में दर्ज़नो आवेदन के लिए हज़ारों रूपये चुकाने पड़ते हैं, जो अनेकों के लिए असंभव और बहुतायातों के लिए बेहद कठिन होता है। यदि आवेदन शुल्क नहीं लिया जाएगा तो करोड़ों युवा आपको धन्यवाद करेंगें,राजेन्द्र सिंह नेगी देहरादून

1 0 namaste PM sir. I am studying 12th standard. Sir, We, the Indians are around 130 crores or above as on date in terms of population, but we are eagerly waiting for the rare of the rarest medal in RIO olympics.Physical education should be made a compulsory subject with practicals so that all students will automatically engage themselves for sports and games , which will lead BHARATH to the number one position in this universe.
0 0 another small suggestion I would like to make. in middle east where our citizens are employed, we are treated as second class citizens compared to the passport holders from European, English and American citizens. there are two types of salaries for a person with same qualification and experience. an European gets four times our salary. this affects our dignity and self respect. our foreign ministry should talk to these governments.

0 0 Prime Minister sir,there should be a pan India strong regulation for school education given by CBSE as private school management is exploiting children and parents by way of charging heavy school fee as well as mandatory changing every year books of all classes so as to old book can not be read thus forcing the parents to buy new books.My another view about Divyang who receives convenience allowance of Rs.400/pm that should be increased now.
0 0 I will request onrable pm to renew our education policy. one nation one education policy.board should be cbse for class 1 to 12.all state board should be converted in to cbse board.on other hand there should be one nation one exam for all professional courses admissions to be granted on all india ranks.poor and medium peoples can't afford cbse education in private school so all state and central schools would be cbse.PADHEGHA INDIA BADHEGA INDIA

This is to highlight the changing education and respect level for women in our society.
       Rapes and such activities are becoming more and more day by day which is not a good sign. Severe punishment should be there for such culprits. We live in a country where women are worshipped on festivals and this is the respect we have for those goddesses. Strict rules should be made and seriously followed to avoid and prevent such activities.

You may also warn them  that should there be war with Pakistan on this account in the near future , India would not stop till POK and Gilgit are recaptured by us .

Already we are seeing the negative side effects in the form of depleting natural resources, shrinking agricultural lands, crime rates, lack of empathy etc.

लोगों की शिक्षा के साथ क्रूर मजाक किया जा रहा है, खासकर सरकारी विद्यालयों और महाविद्यालयों में ।यह सिर्फ डिग्री उत्पादन  करने का स्रोत बनकर रह गया है । गुणवत्तापूर्ण शिक्षण दिनों दिन क्षीण होती जा रही है । दोषपूर्ण शिक्षा निति कई पीढ़ी को बर्बाद कर देगी । शिक्षा को प्राथमिक स्तर से सुधारने की जरुरत है । अभी शायद ही किसी विद्यालय में विज्ञान की प्रयोगशाला होती होगी । शिक्षा को समवर्ती सूची से हटाकर पूरे देश के लिए समान व गुणवत्तापूर्ण शिक्षा प्रणाली बनाने पर जोर देना चाहिए ।
0 0 Sir, Make In India initiative will be successful only if we buy the goods Made in India.  When you had appealed people to buy Khadi, sale of Khadi had more than doubled. Likewise, you should appeal the people of India to buy and insist for Made in India goods only and to promote local industry and manufacturers.  Another swadeshi movement is required for attaining financial freedom.  Jai Hind
0 0 Honourable Prime Ministerji, I would like to bring your kind attention that in our country courts take very long time nearly 20 years to deliver final judgement in cases whether it is civil or criminal. Because of this , crimes are increasing . innocent people are suffering; At the same time criminals are freeing with out punishment.  Juctice  delay is the main reason for increasing corruption and malpractices also. I kindly request you to speak about this and make the law to get justice in time

0 0 Dear Sir,
In a recent Town-hall you were talking about how wearing khadi can improve the condition of the people involved in the khadi industry. In India and worldwide, the corporate office follows a tradition of wearing casuals on Fridays, why cant we have same for government offices and involve khadi in it. My suggestion is like there is a casual attire day in corparate offices worldwide on Fridays same-way we should have khadi day for government offices through out India may be a Friday.
0 0 Dear modiji,

आप अपने उदबोधन में देश के उदीयमान खिलाड़ियों के प्रोत्साहन के लिए स्कूल स्तर पर राष्ट्रीय प्रतियोगिता में भाग लेने वाले छात्रों को पढ़ाई जारी रखते हुए ही सरकारी नौकरी देने की घोषणा करे तो जिससे हम खिलाड़ी बच्चे निश्चिंत होकर अपना शत प्रतिशत प्रदर्शन कर सकेंगे । पद की योग्यता के अनुरूप पढ़ाई आगे खेलते हुए कर सकते है । ग़रीब परिवार के खिलाड़ी बच्चे लाभान्वित होकर भ्रष्टाचार से बचेंगे ।

1 0 If every earning citizen of India contributes, just one rupee per day,  Modiji can provide world class medical facilities to the poor and needy.  The fund should be supervised by Modiji himself to make it reality.  This reduces pressure on the Government also.
0 0 Respected PM ji,
I request you to level the playing field for Hindu education institutions. Right now RTE applies to only Hindu non minority institutions, which is not fair. And this is NOT sab ka sath.
Please make laws that are equally applicable for all the citizens of India in education. Right now it is minority Vs Majority. All individuals should have same rights. Please talk about individual rights not group rights and entitlements.
Thanks,

0 0 21 दिसम्बर 1963 को भारत में भ्रष्टाचार के खात्मे पर संसद में हुई बहस में डॉ राममनोहर लोहिया ने जो भाषण दिया था वह आज भी प्रासंगिक है। उस वक्त डॉ लोहिया ने कहा था सिंहासन और व्यापार के बीच संबंध भारत में जितना दूषित, भ्रष्ट और बेईमान हो गया है उतना दुनिया के इतिहास में कहीं नहीं हुआ है। निश्चित तौर पर यह माननीय लोहिया जी का एक बड़ा वक्तव्य तो बन गया लेकिन इस पर पालन कितना हुआ, इसकी तमाम गिरहें पिछली केंद्र सरकार में हुए घोटालों की खबरें खोलती रही हैं। लेकिन हम असलियत से पर्दा हटा रहे हैं।

0 0 Education in India has become business for all industrial houses. Education policy needs to be discussed and proper policy to be framed. One idea can be to privatise education and allow institutions set up in private sector to run at their own without any tax exemption etc. and also coexist institutions set up by government and truly on charitable basis for deserving section of society.

0 0 Swach Bharat is a response to the great degree of uncleanliness and filth in India. It is very courageous of PM Modi to take up this intractable problem. But we should take more fundamental steps to solve the problem of waste management in India today. This should involve more and more members of the public...and become a part of the consciousness of millions of students all over India. We create waste and trash...We can solve it ONLY IF WE ACT in unison.

Also i want to tell you one thing that, please ask our citizens know about railways. Many software engineers also dont know basics of railways and how it works. I feel improvement railways surely help this huge population. But it should come from people. People should pitch for more railway lines and speed train. It helps to resolve issues in land acquisitions and administration issues for new lines. All citizen must understand importance of railways and how it will help environment

0 0 Dear Pradhan Mantri Shrimaan Narendra Modiji,
It is important for citizens of India to 'feel' the pride  of a developed nation
This feeling will not come from any amount of infrastructure development.
It can come by a self declaration that we are developed!
With it comes the ownership that we are responsible for our current state.
Sow such seed of national pride
Physical development has to follow, but maybe we attempted it the other way round in past hence we lagged.

0 0 In Karnataka parents have come to believe that engineering and medicine are the only two options for children causing a lot of frustration among children. Also they are unaware of various other opportunities. In your independence day speech, please do encourage the youth and parents to encourage children to choose from a diverse set if career options. Also, it would be of help if parents are made aware of the various career options and dispel the fear that those options are fraught with risks.
0 0 Despite our great culture and tradition, what most Indians now lack,is "Discipline". Inspite of many great personalities we have/had, it is unfortunate that most of our population lack Discipline. It is the root cause for all other bad qualities like corruption, un-civilised behaviour, social irresponsibility, lack of civic sense, and many more. Self displine paves way for every other virtue. Unlike in my childhood 60 years ago, now children are not taught morals and discipline.This needs focus.
0 0 Thnx sir for getting contributions of  people
Truely ur govt. Is for people by great people and doing great work for nation.

The contributions to this fund should be tax free and even source of money need not to be disclose.

0 0 Sir,
It was nice to see a Railway minster talked about On-Time-Running of train in his railway budget. The new government has already started talking about the system efficiency. Let us give it a big boost. Being from the manufacturing industry, I understand the importance of improved efficiency. Let us teach people more on this, for example, following traffic rules will not only improve safety, it would reduce fuel cost. A significant improvement will be gained if we follow discipline. Thanks!
0 0 Dear sir,  
I want to give a suggestion but i am sure wont take it. But as citizen its my responsibility to express my views and give suggestion. The meaning of independence in democratic country is rights for all. But in india , i one of the person who feels its not happening. I can give many examples on it. But one major thing is about LGBT rights. Section 377 making many criminals for their biological needs. I hope you mention for their basic rights in speach and protect human rights.

Sir another point is I have received the appreciation letter from you in my name for giving up the gas subsidies in the same way please reward people respecting the laws and pay taxes.
0 0 One of the very important initiative that needs your utmost attention is the safety of women and girls in India. This cannot be second to none.

0 0 Dear Shri PM Modiji, I saw Indian news channels reported quoting you saying that 'PoK belongs to Jammu and Kashmir' as a message conveying to our neighbors and the world. I feel you should have quoted further to clarify 'and Jammu and Kashmir in its entirety is part of India and belongs to India' I think your statement limits to lots of vagueness for interpretation by all parties concerned. They need to get clear message without any ambiguance. Thank you.
1 0 Respected Sir,
I have to say that the five day week working is not suitable for our country as we have many holidays and if one holiday happens to be near weekend or in the beginning, there is a temptation to add one or two casual leaves and go away. This hampers public work as well as puts load on transportation system. LONGER OFFICE HOURS HAS NOT WORKED. I therefore submit that SIX DAY WEEK WITH SECOND SATURDAY EVERY MONTH OFF SHOULD BE ADOPTED AGAIN.
0 0 congrats for your great work!
Many IT people want to teach the school students, they also want to contributes his/her knowledge, but there is no platform to enroll themselves to schedule the classes of any gov. school or private school.
0 0 Sir, please  emphasise on talent based education and assistance to economically weak sections of society and not based on caste. While every person who needs assistance should look up to the government, the criteria should be merit cum means and not caste. Sir, this will set india on a course to achieve by merit, value by quality and excel  through perseverance. Govt assistance will reach the needy and weed out wasted consumption by those who don't deserve. May be its another form of -give it up
0 0 Hon' Prime Minister,as a student,I fell may emphasis has been should be further laid on the present state of the education system.As we are taught in upper-primary classes that all three academic streams i.e. Science,commerce and humanities have immense potential to open new doors for it's students.However,my experience suggests that the stream system prevalent in our education system bias against the divergent personalities of students.We arts students face harsh remarks for our choices.Why?
0 0 1. Start with Pradhan Sevak as you did last time.
2. Stopping Child labor and educating each child.
3. more secured outfits to soldiers

1 0 Dear sir,
One of the most undesirable issue in our country even after 60 years of independence is the practice of "Begging". Our country's image is being diminished in front of tourist by these people. Majority of theme are forced into begging by a network of goons, please consider these ideas to eradicate begging:
1.Make begging a criminal act
2.Imprisonment up to 3 months where they can be given training to earn a living
3.Provide rehabilitation center for victims of forced begging.
0 0 1. PLEASE RENAME KASHMIR AS  Shri Mahatma Gandhi Nagar in short M G Nagar. To command 70th independence point of view this rename would diffuse too much tension. It's nothing wrong in renaming because our beloved leader Shri Mahatma Gandhi brought independence hence it make sense to rename. All issues tension would brought down from 50000 feet to 500 ft by renaming...........Best
0 0 Honorable PM,
This independence day, you should speak about how in 1947, Indian Govt. got political independence from British control but even now, the common Indian citizens, startups and businesses still lack economic independence due to regressive and excessive amount of rules, regulations and complex laws which hamper development in many indirect ways.
I want you to re-chant the slogan - "Minimum Government, Maximum Governance" from the Red Fort and ensure its speedy implementation.

Please ask people to walk for at least 30 minutes everyday. This will help control NCDs.

These below 10 points submitted for your kind consideration basically uplift the down trodden people dwelling in Rural Indian wherein Basic Hygiene/Health care/Nutrition/Awareness and minimum requirement of day to day life not available.

इस स्वतंत्रता दिवस आप देश की बेटियों और महिलाओं को यह भरोसा दिलाएं कि वे किसी भी राज्य के किसी भी प्रांत में क्यों न रहें,इस देश की नागरिक होने के कारण,वे सुरक्षित रहेंगी, तथा सम्मानपूर्वक रहेंगी। न कि डर-डर कर। डरें वे जो उनके साथ गलत करते हैं, उनकी इज्जत के साथ खिलवाड़ करते हैं। लड़कियों को यह भरोसा दिलाएं कि वे भारत जैसे महान, जगतगुरू कहलाने वाले देश में अब भी उन्हें उतना ही सम्मान मिलेगा, वे पहले भी पूजनीय थीं और अभी भी उनका वही स्थान है हमारे समाज में।

I wont talk any complaints as we are entering our 70th Day of Independence. What the world is seeing now I think we are the nation which is the ray of hope with unity in diversity and what happened in Kashmir puts question mark on the same. My suggestion would be if you can speak about the issue, the people over there will feel more comfortable, if you can make promise to held talks with them that would be utterly helpful on our Great Independence Day.

0 0 There are few areas for improvement.
1. Public Toilet / Urinals Conditions : Today Maintenance guy is needed for every Public Toilet / Urinals. No Water is there. Public is passing by keeping distance from it covering nose. When entering into it then it's condition allow you not  to Urinate there or urinate keeping a distance. I think situation should be pathetic in villages and small towns.
2. Public have a choice not to permanently giving up lpg subsidy but for a particular booking.
0 0 The Govt must have a watchdog behind it.Otherwise,under the inefficient administrators can ruin the civilization.People should play the role of watchdog.For that we need a powerful institution of association of citizen. To make it workable and powerful The idea of Civil Society should be incorporated in the Constitution. Every city,sub division,police station,and special villages should have a civil society. Members should not be less than five and more than fifteen.Selected by citizen. Jai Hind

0 0 Respected PM, after long time we people had got deserving PM. The scenario created by opposition & press in india recently is disturbing, i don't know how you handle it and keep calmness, focus. I think the problem lies in judiciary & law enforcement agency, political party worker are above the law & common citizen are criminal. Justice is delayed so culprit are free to do another crime without fear. No public servant is held for negligence of duty that's why the corruption is not under control.
0 0 The nation can't be called as a Developed Nation if the people of nation are owning Cars, Developed nation is based on "How many peoples are using public transports", The people of upper and middle upper class does't feel to travel in Public Transport and It shows the Government transports are to be developed more and make the people to use more Public transports helping many problems.
One more issue, Is to control the air pollution in cities so that people can feel free to walk in the cities

To boost coal production, we need not to give the coal mines to private sector.

0 0 Respected  sir, lot of money coins are being wasted by people particularly Hindus by throwing in  to rivers when they travel by trains or  buses and crossing over bridges. Kindly appeal them not to throw money coins into rivers.
For 'Swachchh Bharat' appear people to put garbage in dustbins rather than appealing for repeated cleaning by 'Zadu'
Appear all banks to deposit money of people on counters rather than sending them in money deposit machines as many illiterate are harassed by that.

0 0 PM rightly condemned the illegal activities related to cow vigilantes and the word were converted to action by the centre to state take action against all the activist. However the state government like Hryana has decided to give government licence to select activists to continue the vigilantes with ID card.
This looks like giving licence to parallel government. Basically they have tweaked the PM good intention and the discrimination against the human violation will continue without abetment.

After Independence, India has got a credible PM. During your election manifesto you promised good governance. But after two year of ruling this could achieved only 20%. More stringent action is required to 100% in some Sectors, like Coal. The people sitting at top level are not doing well. Discipline actions are not being taken to the delinquent officials who are involved in conduct and discipline rules and last but not lease who are not disposing off files.

if there is any crime, any fight or any dispute between two persons or two groups and one of those persons or groups belong to lower cast, all the media gives it colour of DALIT UTPEEDAN. This starts all cheap politics and unwanted hatred in upper and lower casts. Please ask media not to give the colour of castism to every incident. There is no need to mention the cast or religion in every incident. Why people should be interested in their cast. A crime is a crime  on any caste.

0 0 Sir, We would like to share our views regarding unauthorised running of various NGOs under different ministry at village level. We have come across some NGOs run by few group of people who are misleading Govt.fund and running fake NGOs for Gaushala. They have no proper set up like Infrastructure against which they are taking huge Govt.funding. Likewise few NGOs are running under Animal Welfare Board Of India at Allahabad .We therefore request PMO to make a strict policy for NGOs working in India

Now-a-days most of the towns and cities are overcrowded with the migration of both young and old towards cities for better opportunities and facilities, causing great strain on the cities. So it is better to build SMART VILLAGES too, with sound medical facilities, uninturrupted power supply and well-connected roads so that at least the old and retired can look forward for peaceful retired life in the villages. In other words these villages should be well planned OLDAGE HOMES
0 0 On health front best medical facilities through Govt. Hospitals free of cost to all the citizens of India above the age of 55 and where the senior citizens are compelled to get the treatment from Private Hospitals 100% subsidy should be provided to them.This is very important.

The only difference is money which  is too provided by govt.. then why after all such facilities they are given reservation in marks.

Example 2. A village pradhan must publish how much yearly budget he has  got and how that money is being spent on monthly basis. 
All information should always be available online.

My suggestion is for two fronts to start with. First is best quality education to all the children of my country and second is best medical facilities to the senior citizens above the age of 55.
All the children should be provided best quality education and it should be 100% free to the weaker section of the society and  at 50% of  cost to economically weaker persons up to class 12th.

I am from Mumbai. I request you to speak on three issues:
1.Road safety in India-more than a lakh people die in road accidents in India every year, the reason being rash driving, bad roads and infrastructure.
2.Improving storage facilities for the food grains. We are noticing that lot of food grain is getting spoiled due to lack of proper warehouses.
3.About the steps your govt is taking to bring back black money. People are thinking nothing is happening on this front.

Today morning there was a programme in one of the leading malayalam channel about the dalits in gujarat. If the news is reliable there is no sochanalayams, no good houses and hospitals etc in that area. India got indipendence in 1947. After that so many goverments came. Your governement  also have so many development programmes. But still these poor peoples are not getting the benefits of that . We have to think about that and do the needful to solve this problems.

0 0 Overtime is a menace and promotes unemployment. recently the allowable OT hours are increased from 50 per quarter to 90 per quarter. It is wrong. The more important is, it should be strictly followed. Large industrial hoses as well as some PSUs are not following this strictly. They just calculate average OT per person, instead it must be per person. penalty should be ten times for not adhering to this rule for organisation. OT means snatching bread from from hungry one.

The reasons may be- lack of patriotism and faults in politics and economic system. This needs a serious attention!

0 0 Jai hind sir my question is why students should go for PhD. After completion of PG a student is almost 24-25 years and a lot of family responsibilities comes upon him so he has to go for earning.PhD student got stiphend only when he has cleared JRF or NET test,rest other students don't got any money. Then others students have very tough situation to take decision whether to go for earning or for some research work and normally choose to earn to complete social obligations. Please look into.
0 0 Sir it will be great chance to show people how there is a deficiency created in all the three forces under UPA gov.
And you should also tell people that how much prepared India is to go on a two front war with china and pak .As this is the utmost truth that both countries are doing joint exercise to set back India.
Also tell the recent developments made in militarising India because a nation is looked on with respect only when it is highly capable in terms of military.

0 0 India is a land of teachers. There is a dearth of medical teachers in this country.Doctors in government medical college are not the only ones who can teach and they are too few. There are  so many doctors in private practice, who love teaching and teach all the time in conferences. Teaching is  matter of passion and pleasure for them.Conduct an aptitude and knowledge based test and then select teachers.
So, Kindly use their services and help eliminate the artificial dearth of medical teachers.

When we believe that justice delayed is justice denied, is it not the high time to make our courts work for 24 x 7 - 365 days so that justice delivery time for the common man improves.

0 0 We celebrate independence day every year but that was independence from British rule. We will be truly independent when we get independence from caste system reservations, hunger , mal nutrition, poverty, corruption. We will be independent when we stop thinking that we belong to UP or Haryana or any other state or caste and Identify ourself as Bhartiya or Indian. All govt forms, school or college admission forms should be modified where there should not be any column for caste or category.

Sir, in India lots of fresh study books/material are distributing to needy students every year under various welfare schemes by state/central govt's, which required lots of tree cutting to print. I suggest to generate the system of books rotation by collect the distributed books/study materials from students and redistribute it to students of upcoming year. Which save lot tree from cuttings to use specifically print for this purpose as well as expenses too.
0 0 Dear PM
I feel that we as a nation can do lot more. But to do so we must be united. We haven't gained independance from the colonists. Their techniques of divide and rule are still influencing us, sadly these days its a work of some selfish indians. Secondly I would like you to seriously review our education system. As a young college I would say that our education system is right now horrible. Educations primary goal must shift from making employees to making better individuals.
0 0 1). People of India need a sense of belonging to the country and must have a feeling for his country, They must show it and support to others also.
2). There will be no dividing factors on the national issue as well. Personal gain will not  be preferred to National welfare.
3). All people must be ensured of free primary Health, Social support in Food etc,and free primary education. And this shall be made binding and duty of Governments.

It may take more time to percolate down the line.  However, the common man is disillusioned with the price rise, especially in the essential commodities like pulses.  Swift and demonstrative steps should be taken to control price rise.  No sections of our society should feel alienated or neglected.Values should be taughttokids

Until we see 100% peace in Kashmir Valley, we as an Indian won't be in position to enjoy the Independence Day. Kashmir is part of India and it is heaven in earth. Unfortunately the valley is going through bad phase since Independence. we must pave the road for our next generation to enjoy such beautiful place. Under your leadership we want peace to return in valley and want the people of Kashmir to leave in Peace and harmony like people at other states in India.
0 0 proper education by every school to every child is the right solution of maximum problems
but bigger challenge is to bring uniformity of basic curriculum taught in right spirit n zeal
tragedy is, many have blessings of laxmi ji but are far off from saraswati ji
those who have blessings of saraswati ji and hence have better understanding of education have no money to run their own schools and colleges/universities
hence education imparted is improper. modi ji has to take up this challenge.

0 0 Sir please celebrate 70th year with slogan 'work with commitment, work with accountability'.
Most of the system problems are due to lake work culture. Public service of all areas lack both commitment and own sense of accountability. The whole mess is due lack of work doing culture. You have tighten the corruption nose, but at large this is still prevailing. It happens mostly because of non working culture.
This slogan would be a transforming one like 'celan Ganga'.
0 0 As new vacancies are sanctioned in government and public sector after due deliberations and most of the time a year or two later from the initiating of processes, the existence of too many vacancies at various levels directly mean heavy pendency of work. Judiciary’s case is not different. Government should move forward to a ‘zero-vacancy’ concept. GOI may have to consider legislative measures to enable retiring judges/officials to continue on contract basis till vacancies are filled.

0 0 2). For the employees of unorganized sector and many private firms, EPF is implemented. But the pension from it is very meager. Except for very low wage workers, many employees contribute as per the ceiling wage of Rs.6,500 (or the revised Rs.15,000), all throughout their service. Then their pension is also calculated based on the ceiling at the time of their retirement. Rs.3,250 is the typical pension. A better computation method that takes care of contributions and inflation may be needed.
0 0 Dear Pradhan mantriji
1 ) there should be a pension for income tax payer. business people who contribute income tax does not have any retirement benefit.

“There is urgency to fast-track justice not only when sensational issues come up and media/ popular protests highlight them. The immediate measures could include:

• Leaving the remaining cases to new Special Courts to be put in place at all levels depending on the number of pending cases.
• Ensuring vacancies of judges are filled in time

I have been working for the Education and Protection of the underprivileged children for last 18 years and found that several steps have been taken from the government to ensure education of all children.

This would certainly accelerate the objectives of Right to Education and glory of the country.

Right since independence, we as citizens have always been taught to fight for our rights. Our entire thinking so far has been "rights-based". Time has now come to talk about duties of each citizen towards other fellow citizens, society and the nation. How can we promote this vital concept among citizens. Can we observe a 'duty day' every month where we talk only about our duties and not rights? Without a sense of duty, our development will remain incomplete.
