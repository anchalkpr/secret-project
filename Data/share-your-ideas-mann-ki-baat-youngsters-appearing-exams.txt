26 3 Hello to My Gov.& students,
   First i am pointing out some weaknesses in our edu. System
1. Teachers in gov as well as Private schools & colleges are not upto the mark.
2. Bad condition of Gov.schools they needs proper supervision.
3. Why Caste system in selection for job and admission?
    For students
1. Set you goal(short and long term)
2. Dont think about the results think about your today's goal.
3. Use visual learning.
4. Be relax during exam.
Best wishes for exam.
5 0 "Understand the meaning" is study or learning. So don't read but study for exam. Bring down in writing in your sentence form. A well understood topic could expressed in simple wordings of yours. Now you think you are teaching someone the topic while writing down. You'll be successful.
7 0 Dear PM ji,Naman!!!Am Sunanda Jati, Principal of a K-12 school in western Odisha. I extend my whole hearted gratitude for choosing this topic for Maan ki baat.My humble request to you please speak to the parents not to treat their children as score producing machines.Each child is having his potential and area to excel in their lives. Mere failure or success in exam doesn't determined their future prospects. If parents support is there then undoubtedly they can do wonder.They need their parents.

2 0 There are no short cuts in life. Only hard work will pay you desired dividends. Focus on your goal in life and work step by step to achieve it . One time victory is not enough to reach your goal. Honesty to yourself is a must. Competition should always be to do better than last time. When you start realising  your potential than you will start competing to yourself. Only need of the hour is to give your best shot in whatever you do. Success will be definitely yours. Be all rounder in life.

3 0 There are very less resources for rural schools in comparison to urban schools specially private schools this divide should be mitigated through making provisions in upcoming financial budget.
1 0 Dear sir, India ke All private school,college,institutes ke liye rules And regulations hone chaaiye jisse ye apni manmani nahi kare  aaj kal private school, colleges,institute bina receipt ke manmana paisa lete h, fees ke liye koi guidelines nhi h sir   kabhi school kit ( bag, books,id) ke liye 5000/-tak fees lete h jiska koi hisab nhi hota h , aur students ko dena hi padhta h kyoki uske future ka sawal hota h aur kabhi konsa shulk to kabhi konsa  So please sir make a good guidelines for This
0 0 Regarding exam point of view
1. Eat fresh fruit and protien rich grains during study
2. Play Games or do external activities for 1-2 hour between study to feel free before study
3. Force talented people to come in politics.
0 0 A student should adopt certain strategies and prepare very thoroughly (with full concentration) in the coming weeks for the Board Exams. The student should now do a review about his/her preparation till date and accordingly proceed. Furthermore, a student should prepare for the Board Exams not just to secure high marks but also to use this knowledge to further their education and to apply that knowledge in the practical life. Lastly, they should keep their cool and give their best.
1 0 Dear PM, I am feeling glad that govt are thinking for youngsters.
1.Make ground in a school compulsory to take out hidden talent of students. Lacs of schools are still there without a small ground to play in India.
2.Have a motivational courses in schools and colleges to motivate students to join politics to have a bright future of India, thus we  have get some bright minded and talented people in politics.
3.Make a common fully verified consultancy site to get jobs vacancies for students.

0 0 Sir please do something with this medical colleges in previous they fill their seats by huge donation and leak question paper who give donations and now when govt be strict and enforced neet ug where they can do nothing  then they hike fee equivalent to donation. This is partial job done by your govt.one side is reservation and other side huge fee colleges. I really want to become doctor we are not going to become superpower when we not invest in education and only in education

0 0 Previous year mci and supreme court of India introduced neet-ug exam for admission in all medical colleges for mbbs course to favour merit. Sir you know in India private sector medical colleges are more than public sector (govt)  medical colleges.there is huge hike in tuition fee in medical colleges even in some colleges more than 20 lakes per annum so how a middle class family afford this. Those colleges whose fee is just 5 lakh increase its fee to 12 to 23 lakh in single year. This is not fair
1 0 I dont want reservation to be ended i just want ssc to conduct exam fairly without any mismanagement... Pls sir pay heed to ssc. Coz this deprtment can truly help inun achieving ur dream of make in india ..
2 0 Resp. Prime Minister Sir, The very concept of 'Preparing for Exam' need change to 'Preparing for Gaining Knowledge'. Present scenario is Read Guides instead of Text Books, Join Coaching Classes instead Attending Classes, Solve last 5-10 years exam papers and write answers and Score More so as to get Good Job. This scenario need to change to 'Acquire Knowledge, Understand Its Importance and Use It In Daily Life' How? By changing pattern of Exam More stress on Practicals and Real Life projects
1 0 This cgl 16 was conducted online but unfortunately it has snatched the real transparency .the server issue is inevitable..students are crying but ssc is happy.chairman is saying student who faved server problem its their bad luck..totally reckless statement .even i am loosing 15 marks in cgl 16 tier 2 and having no prof of it. Thousands of students have worked hard now inefficient server is ruinjng ttheir dreamsdreams.pls sir pay attnetion here.conduct cgl 16 tier 2 again in a fair manner.tnku
1 0 A very good evening sir
I am an ssc cgl we all know ssc is a constitutional body and the second biggest exam conducting body after UPSC for different group B and group C posts. Bt unfortunately in todays scenario it has lost its authenticity in the eyes of students. Cheating malpractices mismanagement etc has touched the sky. And a laborious student is the real sufferer of tthis inefficiency and adding fuel to this fire ssc is paying no heed towards this. It just says everything is ok but no..

0 0 It is necessary to understand topic of subjects, instead of memorizing the topic content. In fact now all profanations courses entries are through entrance tests therefore scoring high in board exam under such a tension is no more required.

1 0 Honorable Prime Minister Sir  , I want to suggest that Before last final preparation of Exams ,All students should practice Yoga like Pranayam and Deep Meditation everyday  ,this will help them to reduce there stress and tensions regarding there final preparation of exams and improve there brain and mind power both and it will help them to outperform in there final exams and they will score more and more marks .This practice of Yoga will help them to secure bright results in there final exams.

2 0 There should be Transparency in job exams at state and all India exams.
There is lot of corruption in job exams.

1 0 Respected PM of INDIA,
I would like to express my suggestions on G.S.T slab on Telecom services(mainly on mobile bills). I came to know that mobile bills comes under 18% slab,if it comes under 12% slab poor and middle class people will benefited. Now a days mobile is necessary for every purpose, mainly for DIGITAL INDIA which we all are working for. If telecom services become costlier people may deviate from using digital services. They simply switch to other NON-DIGITAL processes.
0 0 my idea is to first cancel the Quota system in job oriented exams/entrance exams etc because the youth is the building block of the nation.And due to Quota system Unreserved candidate suffers a lots of problems even after scoring good marks in exams he/she not get the job or admission just because of category.For example SSC exam,one student(general) become inspector after getting 400+ marks,SC/ST/OBC become at only 350+.So, at last its a humble request please cancel the Quota system in job exam

The engineering education system in india is totally failed because of the business interest of institute rather than providing quality of education and various flaws in engineering program.
even we are going for digital india but we are still studying very old syllabus and pattern which is not accordance to current industry demand.
the second reason is the we are hiring qualified faculties not passionate faculties and believe me we have great faculties in india.

1. Students should learn by doing Practicals in subjects like Science and Maths from their lower classes like 5th Standard onwards. This will improve the Researchand Development Scenario in India. Bring in lot of Innovation in India.
2. Standardisation of Education across all the schools of India.

0 0 Students and parents should be told that "getting high marks is good, BUT, not getting high marks is *not end of life* ".
This will remove the stress out of the students and parents.
Moreover, in the long run, value-education should be added which will remove the copying/cheating by students/parents.

We are expecting thella wala, every common man to join digital india and do all the transactions using mobile/cc/debit card for daily usage.
But as usual biggest culprit are most of the gov services, they accept only cash.
In last 30 days I have visited 3-4 gov operated offices and all uses cash.
1. Pune ST stand
2. Pune RTO
3. Mumbai ST stand.
These all org deals with lakhs and crores daily. Why don't they accept cc/mobile?
You have to answer.

 As per my view , Board exams should be done in the same school.....because if we are sending board inspectors to every school that what is the requirement of sending students to different schools...??  It means that either we are not trusting the Inspectors or we are not trusting our students...
PLease tell students ....
0 0 MY REQUEST TO YOU IS THAT IN MAN KI BAAT YOU WILL TELL STUDENTS GETING GOOD MARKS IS NOT GUARANTEE OF SUCCESS.IF YOU GET LESS MARKS THAN IT DOES NOT MEAN YOUR LIFE IS FINISHED.
I AM GET HEARTED BY LISTENING NEWS.ONE STUDENT DIED BECAUSE HE DIDNOT GET RANK UNDER TOP100 IN EXAM OF IITEXAM.
ANOTHER A GIRL WHO WAS A TOPPER OF IIT BOMBAY UPTO 7 SEMESTERS IN B.TECH.SHE WAS HIGHEST MARKS SCORERER.BEFORE THE FINAL EXAM SHE FELT THAT WHAT IF SHE DIDNOT GET GOLD MEDAL.ON THATDAY SHE COMMITED SUICIDE
0 0 Some major problems faced by students giving exams at various stages of life esp. those giving competitive exams like engineering, medical , other graduation entrance exams, non availability of important dates regarding exams, sample papers , proper guidance to enter various Indian Institutes at one place. Recently I came across an application on Google play store “ ALL ABOUT EXAMS”  which has very sincerely overcome the above issues and guide the students in all aspects.
0 0 Children appearing for examination should not concentrate only on the mark scoring or percentile but they should understand that examination is nothing but a translation of their hard effort in study/learning which is to be converted into words in the answer sheets. It is none other than their confidence which will bring good marks. Keep believing in yourselves.

0 0 Dear sir, the exams of many young students are around the corner. We should support the 21st century generation. No matter how well their grades are in the board exams, their future cannot be decided by these exams!  Edison once quoted" A single sheet of paper cannot decide my future".
The greatest minds on this globe were never good at grades.
1 0 Dear Sir, humble request behalf of all real Indian talents that please cancel reservation in education. Every student study from same books, same teacher teaches him and all of them solves same exam paper then why system should makes difference of category and cast for future admission.
•When all students are studying at same level it means opportunity has given to everybody then admission for future education should be given on merit basis.
•Even financial background of open or general catego

     I AM A STUDENT PREPARING FOR NEET MEDICAL ENTRANCE EXAM 2017. NOTIFICATION FOR  NEET HAS NOT BEEN COME OUT TILL DATE. BUT, IT IS KNOWN FROM NEWSPAPER THAT ONLY 3 CHANCES WILL BE ALLOWED FOR APPEARING THE EXAM. I AM COMING FROM A BACKWARD PLACE IN KERALA AND I HUMBLY REQUEST THAT THIS CHANGE MAY BE EFFECTED IN NEXT YEAR ONWARDS OTHERWISE THE UNEXPECTED DECISION WILL AFFECT THE CHANCE OF POOR STUDENTS STUDYING FOR THE NEET EXAM FOR THE LAST YEARS.
1 0 sir, students are mostly wasting their time in writing unnecessary assignments and its time to change the education practices. Young students are carrying burdens in the form of bags and their creative levels are suppressed and they are taught to give more importance to ranks and grades than the actual knowledge. It's better to bring students under one roof which enhances their creativity. In Andhra Pradesh there are factories which are brain washing students to concentrate only on ranks.
0 0 Passionate teachers can serve the nation & produce lot of talent for the country. All factors patents , teachers, students all played very important role to clear the exam in my opinion hence if hardwork & passion is there than definitely we all get the success.
0 0 Whole year students work Hard near about 15 Hrs/ Day (08 Hrs. in school,04 Hrs in tuition classes,03 Hrs at home)Parents should behave friendly with their children during exam time. Help in studies like at study time make a tea & coffee for our children. Don't give extra burden of result (Percentage). Bye a small-small gift like chocolate, sweets etc. for your children give .
Do not discussed at home on percentage or admission for higher study. Maintain a positive atmosphere of home.
0 0 For exams, students should understand that exam is similar to a performance art, like you act or sing or dance on stage or draw a stroke of ink on canvas i.e. once done, you can hardly revert and you would make yourself miserable to make it up. What professional artists in performance art do is that they practise the same thing for thousand times before they appear in front of the audience. To do good in exam, students need to do the same.

What matters in exams is the knowledge we gain so, just clear all concepts instead of running in the mad race of high scores because ultimately, knowledge matters more than marks.
0 0 Sir Its very unfortunate that the intelligence in my country is judged by the numbers/grades on a piece of paper.Let higher secondary education be compulsory for all citizens.There should be no fails.Students below the percentile of average should be given option of skill development programme at tender age of 14-16 yrs partially sponsored by the Government.Every citizen has a birth right to contribute towards nation's development."Har haath ek kaam"Jai Hind #PMonRadio,#AIR,#MannKiBaat,#MyGov

1 0 ‘Mann Ki Baat’ for students
Since, this is Exam time means a very crucial phase of a student's life as the result will determine the destiny and future path of his life. But, the most important thing which matters is that "Hard Work always pays." & Education doesn't merely implies marks or grades. True Education is something which stays with us always and need not be revised again & again. The Knowledge & the Values we imbibe in ourselves make us educated. So, work hard & value time.
0 0 Students work very hard round the year and lose their confidence at such a crucial time.All you need to do is just believe that you are best and you will crack it whether it is JEE or boards, you have done enough preparations needed to do so..!Start solving as many practice papers you can with setting alarm clock at the same hours of the day as of your final examinations.To concentrate and increase brains`efficiency by having 6hr sleep, meditating, following time table,listen white noise,relax

Thanks#mannkibaat
0 0 Reservation according to cast is politically  motivated  hurting a lot of students . General category students scoring 80%-90%  don't get admission in any good institutes while reservation category scoring 30-40% get through top universities . we request a fair chance for all with subsidies for bright students from economically weaker section
0 0 Sir, heartening to see Dubai's tallest tower with tricolor decoration by digital beaming on the eve of republic day. Let us do that in India in all the tallest tower or building of each city during ind day/rep day. All industrial high rise chimneys can be put to use.  Central IT ministry should find means to encourage and implement. The spirit will enlighten the inner feelings of fellow citizens like never before.
1 0 In my view students going to face board exams should not take load of study they should set their goals and accordingly study their storng zone and weak zones and revision is must .Do not take lot of tension study with enjoyment and do little meditation and feel from inside that i want to acheive this not for my parents but for myself do or die is old fashion do it before you die is new one.All the students hope you all do well
0 0 Sir many of youngsters are studying day and night to do better in the exams. Though all will not get 99%. The problem with many a students is their career. Surely each one has exceptional quality where they can do better. With many a students problem lies in proper counselling in this period. You will do a historical decision,should you announce formation of counselling camps headed by well known experts particularly in small towns and rural areas headed by district or state level officials
0 0 Teaching Profession ha sbecome the Last Option of Youth now.Government must see that Capable Youth take up Teaching profession at all levels more particularly at Elementary and High School Level Education.
0 0 practice yogic breathing to concentrate and relax. Avoid outside play during exam days to avoid finger injury and immobility  . Take help of internet for fundamental clarification in the absence of immediate counselling. Do not leave any topic untouched. Selective reading make students jittery and low in confidence . Lastly take blessing of parents before exam.

The books only gives the information,students need skill to convert that information into knowledge.
0 0 Dear Students, I am a graduate candidate from Patna university. I have been through matric exam, intermediate exam and Of course my graduation exams.

So, i want to say only one thing and that is "LOVE YOUR STUDY" and do not give your exam in tension. The more you will love your study the better will be your result

Most of the exceptional talent or students are poor.
After the studies or for career growth, they have no money to fill the entrance exams, to travel for exams or interview. They have no time because they have no money.
They are already loaded with education loans.
I have seen poor talents are begging for an opportunity from counselors door to door.

0 0 CPGRAMS, the grievances redressal forum is not sensitive to the grievances fed into the portal.
The officials pass on the buck and there is no accountability. And as such the mechanisim is not people friendly and is not sensitve to the genuine peoples problems made as such by the insensitive  and irresponsible officials who should be made personally accountable and time frame  for redressal of grievances should be  strictly adhered to.
0 0 Use maximum time to preperations for their exams with social works.they should organise a group including educationally backward students and join their hands to uplift all.priovide little time to such students.while someone shares the subjects it will helps both to remember it forever.its much better then byheart learning.study with criticism.scoring is not important try best to built intellectuals n society.Be bold always.

This results in unjust for the students at platforms like SSB selection for army etc, where basic criteria of selection are graduation Percentage.

Let there be more streams to choose for the students from 9th standard itself. Information Technology, Economics, Environmental science, Religious Studies, Art and Culture could be few to suggest. It shall relieve the students from the stress of studying the subject of not their choice at the same time there would be depth in studies. Further, Country needs world class universities to tap its human capital.Civility and studies of religion should also form part of syllabus.

0 0 Recently a TV channel conducted a programme and asked youth why we are celebrating Republic day. Out of hundred only 2 given correct answer.

This is leading to public not having respect to the system or Constitution. Immediate steps shall be taken to educate youth for taking system in curriculum.

Today I went as usual to encash my matured NSC at above pay office. Person at the window 2 counter very rudely told me that cheque book is not there so contact on Mon 30 Jan on 02228868766 & check whether cheque book at post office has come or not & then only come. This is very disappointing service from post office, as at least they should have taken the NSC for processing. It is very disappointing that post office doesn't have cheque book for such things.

1 0 Dear Sir,
Some major problems faced by students giving exams at various stages of life esp. those giving competitive exams like engineering, medical,other graduation entrance exams is non availability of important dates regarding exams,sample papers,proper guidance to enter various Indian Institutes at one place. Recently I came across an application on Google play store “ ALL ABOUT EXAMS”  which has very sincerely overcome the above issues and guiding the students in all aspects.
0 0 you must suggest students that they should not use facebook instagram twitter and other social networking sites during exam time as they distract the focus of students. one may discard this but this is true.
1 0 An issue that seriously needs to be addressed is the  importance we give to scores. Education does not begin or end with scores and we need to keep reiterating this.
I am a working professional who appeared for CAT this year and scored 95 percentile.I got no IIM calls as they dont consider anything less than 99 and its educating students for management positions but because of this a student aims for top score to get into these colleges instead of actually getting a job and relevant experience

Many of the private schools just keeping study limited to mind scores of exam only. I am in view that to study must be affordable to all even in private schools also. Limited or cap must be fix to private schools fees to help parents / students to get affordable and valuable education for batter life.

0 0 Dear Modiji,
Since this is an open forum for students, i feel, first and foremost, they need to be relaxed and feel good about themselves when they go to write their exams!!! If one isnt relaxed or is not comfortable with themselves, how can they give their best, especially during times like exams??? Students ,for a right frame of mind, need to unwind regularly, talk to their parents and close relatives other than just their friends who themselves are appearing for exams.They must have faith!
0 0 Dear Shri Modi Ji,
    Exams are just a part of the student's academic career which will not decide the success or failure of a person's life. Students should study to acquire knowledge and not for the sake of passing exams. It is also important to study for their sake and not to compete with their friends or negibours. Learning should be a joyous venture and not a sickening process. My best wishes to all the students.

0 0 Dear Sir, my another point which is not related to exam, is for economic equality given by Indian constitution, that why Govt. is not looking for Income tax return filed by Private doctors and Advocates practicing in different courts in whole country, who (both Advocates & Pvt. Doctors) are charging huge fees from their clients or patients, but not issuing any proper recipts and only few of them are filing ITR & only for 20-30% of their actual income. But we R paying IT on salary& pension both.
0 0 sir i just want to tell you that please do something for education system,1-please close the Hindi medium school,do provide education in only one language English,not both bcoz its confusing to all ,first we done study in Hindi medium school after that for competition we should have to knowledge about English,bcoz of that many students not succeed in exams & interview.please convert all (primary & G.I.C.) Hindi medium school in English only,now a days everyone wants English speaking employee
0 0 Dear students, Plz be away from mobile and other sites like games,computer games, facebook, what's app at least for 2-3 months before exam and normally also u should give more than half an hour on such sites on mobile or PC. Instead of this u go to open ground and give one hour over there, which will help you to maintain ur health and feel fresh for furthur study. Also do YOGA/meditation everyday to increase your concentration in studies. MY SUGGESTION IS THAT-DO NOT DO ANYTHING IN EXCESS.
0 0 only imp. that i want to said that the children must study in morning from 4am to 7am which is most energyable time to study. for concentration in our study to meditation. show that ur mind is free from other thin and do study. peace fully and before exam only revise the matter not learn and before 1 hour of exam. just keep ur mind silent. and does not  talk to anyone.
best of luck to children..
0 0 children are good at academics at present provided they avoid social network sites.. as on an average they loose 3 hours a day only in this unproductive networks. It is bad part of the generation.they have to avoid this till the exams are completed & the power supply authority at each state cut off power supply for atleast 90 minutes per day it is bad for the studens.I hope this should be taken care by respective one now.with best wishes for all students.
0 0 Like IIT  the educational videos are available please give orders to record the school lectures of good educational institutions like kendriya vidyalaya, DPS ,donbosco etc to upload their lectures sothat easily every where one can get this knowledge. As technology has increased so please use the technology to crash the exam.
0 0 1.Donot mugup any subject try to understand the subject. After reading ask your self what you have understood read a paragraph close the book and try to think and repeat it by closing the book.
 Book reading will make you understand 30% but watching an educational videos on the same subject matter will increase the efficiency fasten the understanding. For example if ur reading history book regarding tipusultan or British Empire just watch a educational videos in you tube/any site will grasp
0 0 i would say rather then focusing anything else please focus on population . the law should be imply in India that you cant have more then 2 children like it was in china few years back Chinese govt allowed only one child at home so then they took care of population still they are no 1 in terms of population . i believe by this we can work and focus remaining people and make them educated or literate and also provided good education. education is biggest challenge and Indian peeps learn frm japan

One nation one education policy must be implemented like GST one nation one tax, this will not only enhance better education and will also unite us as one country.

If we incorporate right teachings at primary & secondary level into minds of children about their leaders & country in early stages of life that ideas & believes remain till end.

2 0 Hello Sir,
I think, to make our education system better, we must introduce 'One Nation, One Education' policy in India.
We can start it by having a central authority in India, a platform where diff. state boards can share information and which could make sure that every student of India is being delivered the 'SAME and STANDARD' education in every part of our nation. We should make sure that our talent remain in our nation to contribute in our progress. To know more, open the PDF.......
0 0 Education-
-children must realise their passion and persue it, its extremely wrong with today's parenting that they impose their aspirations for difficult exams, doctory and engineering, irrespective of children's potential in some particular field.  
-schools must teach something for children's spiritual awakening. 
-India must have equal oppurtunities for sportsmen, artists and all.
0 0 Dear Students !!! Before going to the Examination, you have already put your best effort to cover the syllabus. The Questions are already fixed, sealed and ready for distribution. Thus, your preparation as well as the questions both are fixed. So you must feel positive with sufficient confidence while sitting in the Exam Hall. Your positive attitude will surely make you steady as well as confident while writing Exam Paper. Your will power to do the best will bring you success. ALL THE BEST !!!
0 0 Hello sir,
 Well i think our Board of Education should put more focus on practical work in school and colleges rather than theory, passing marks should determine by one knowledge about the practical things because that is what matters. Theory Knowledge is valid upto a few days or months, but once you do it in reality, reality of real education reveals.

Digital India is on its way,but IT Engineers hav to migrate all over country to get jobs.
My Idea is to bring -
-Big IT firms to set up at least 1 branch in the Capital city of each state. 
-It will lessen the expenditure of Potential Job seekers, also they can live relaxed life taking care of their family,living near their hometowns.
-Eventually Employment oppurtunities will arise altogether in each state, leaving no state behind. 
Pls implement it.
0 0 I think OC(open category) students are being effected badly in various competitive exams due to following 5 reasons..
1.Age criteria
2.Fees structure
3.Language problem
4.Reservations
5.Scams in exams :
my experience:
I am born in a poor vysya (open caste) farmer family.. Studied at govt. school in Telugu medium (Andhra Pradesh) from childhood in a small village (rural area).
I am badly effected in various competitive exams due to above reasons.
Hon'ble Modi Sir ,please save us.
0 0 Dear Modiji, When you encourage students to bravely appear for exams. Then tell them to study for knowledge and not marks. Its the knowledge that will take the individual and country ahead and not marks. Ask them not to cheat in exam. Tell them to write whatever they know instead of copying from their friends or classmates. If stundents want to help in fighting corruption then they should themselves avoid corrupt practices.

0 0 Sir, why should caste be a factor when appearing for competitive examinations.....my sincere request is to consider only hardwork .thank u
0 0 Respected, i just want to suggest u that make control on Fee structure of Competitive Exam because all open category students are not belongs to rich or middle class family That's why they unable to pay Bank exams conducted through IBPS because there is too much difference between fee structure for other community students & open category students. as like for minority fee is 100Rs & for open category it was 600 or 700Rs So,it is not affordable to all.
Requested to you to reduce fee.
0 0 Sir very recently we celebrated our Republic day. This time during our Republic Day celebration at Kalpna Foundation, an organisation founded by me to educate poor children organised preamble reading program at our teaching venue in Durgakund. We find preamble on the very first page of NCERT books but students are of the habit of reading everything except the preamble. It's impoatant for all of us to know our constitution because it reminds us that along with rights we have responsibilities too
0 0 Hon'ble PM, I would suggest that there should be an increase in number of centres for exams like NDA Exam, CDSE, etc. where only capital cities are chosen as centres. Myself being a student from a small city, can understand the pain that village students have to suffer, when they attend such exams. Pain of travelling, waking all night, locating centres, etc. I would suggest that main cities be set as centres, e.g. in Maharashtra, we can have Pune, Aurangabad, Nanded, etc. as centres. #mannkibaat
0 0 "The sizes and shapes of REFILLs of BALL POINT PENs vary from pen to pen; Company to Company. As a result, when students visit shops to buy a new REFILL, the students find difficulty to get a matching one. The shop might have many varieties of REFILLs, but, sometimes none of those are matching with the students' PEN. The students may have many such PENs without proper availability of matching REFILL. This will lead to wastage of money and material. This problem is also causing displeasure."
0 0 Respected sir,, My Suggestions are like this
1. First to change the learning method from school level,, so there the Teacher should be committed to deliver his knowledge with high level of interest and energy,, it will leads to built sincerity in youngsters brain..
2. The students parents help to students in completion of specific portion of lessons in each subject in a friendly environment 3. Every student should feel free before exams and during examinations,, teaches has to motivate them.
0 0 Respected Sir In each of my student's batch the final sentence I give them is "If u have studied no need 2 panic & if u haven't no use 2 panic" Through this forum Request Parents Not 2 compare Children Each child Is Unique Let It remain unique Need of hour is to make them follow rules by our example Give them faith, self-respect, understand them & their problems. They will Never let us down. This is my way of bringing them 2 normal & socialize them Let's Join Hands to Secure Our Future AMEN

Sir, there is no loan scheme available for the students who wish to gap a year for preparation of medical/engineering entrance examination to get coaching in any coaching institute. As the coaching they provide is not a course. And the fees of such coaching institute is too high for a lower middle class man to pay. Please do something in this regard.
0 0 Respected Sir, Promote for Ph.D. to our engineers. A faculty could not get benefit of it directly. We say, a Teacher is a key person in education, but teacher is not getting respected in Engineering Education in terms of seniority, salary, as per experience. Our GR by UGC, AICTE, regarding pay scale and promotions must be refined properly with proper explanation (not in vague, molding it as per convenience to benefit to private institutions only, not to University, nor Faculty). Thank you.

0 0 Respected Sir, many issues regarding out Indian Education. I will talk about Engineering Education.
1.Schooling to Engineering Education (Diploma,UG,PG & Ph.D.) should be in a flow.
We see that 11th-12th std. & Diploma are difficult than B.E./B.Tech. & M.Tech/M.E. is easier than B.E./B.Tech.2.Industrial Experience of a faculty should be counted in terms of salary, as many universities are not counting industrial experience in teaching.3.Outcome based education is good but not 100% for India.
0 0 Please remove caste based reservation on marks from competitve exams. In IITJEE, ST and SC's need only 45-55/360 and general needs above 105 marks. If you want to help them then give free education and facilities. But why these inequality regarding marks is there.
0 0 The most important thing to practice before any exam is a peace and calm .
What troubles and spoils exams is the pressure and fear , not the exam itself.
A student can answer the same questions in a relaxed environment but when he is expected to perform under restrictions of time and stress of competition , mind finds it hard to focus and nervousness results in poor performance
A balance between study and games will result in greater confidence and improve performance

0 0 Sir,i am Geeta bomman.I suggest the students that they prepare their own notes.it helpful for their annual examinations.
0 0 I find that in the age of calculators and computer, learning tables and sums is very important. Student should learn tables and practice sums which will give them mental alertness, mental efficiency and speed of calculations.  I find that it is very important for all mathematical subjects.  Further students should also practice good handwriting.  However both these things are possible only at least three months before the exams.
0 0 I am a Fellow chartered accountant with merit - All india 25th rank. With my experience I suggest  students should eat simple food without spices during study. They should keep their stomach clean and if they have constipation, they should take ISABGOL with warm water.  They should not continuously study one subject more than 3 hours, they should keep on changing the subject so that they do not get bore. They should sleep 6 to 7 hours daily.

If the Govt gives some tax incentive for cashless business i.e. Income and expenditure should not have more than 10% as cash, particularly expenses should not be more than 10% of total expenses, such company should enjoy some tax concession.

There is a problem with our education system. Most of our study is based on craming our books and then reproducing it in our exams rather than understanding. We need our studies to be more vocational. They need to be more application based.
We need them to boost our talents and interests right from the starting. It is difficult to have entire course changed but I think we can start by having one period every day for every class in which we can learn how to boost our talents and interest.

1 0 Sir,The existing exam oriented learning system in schools should replace with a system to evaluate/identify  the interest/potential/skills of a stud't from lower classes.Interactive sections with stud'ts/teachers/parents will help to get an outcome.The stud'ts can be routed/guided according to their performance basis,from H.S classes onwards.Average/LD students should give options to select subjects for the final exams,ac'dg to their talent.Aim the overall develop't of stud'ts with diff IQ/EQ.

1 0 Sir, it is common to see students having to apply for re-evaluation in the CBSE board exams,and most of the times their requests are also genuine. So don't you think at some point it could be the fault of the examiner as well. Some examiners only give the average marks, that too BLINDLY. We as students are quite confident on ourselves and we know how much we can score in these examinations. Therefore I request you as a STUDENT myself to please reinitiate the re-evaluation scheme in CBSE.

 My son used to  carry a heavy school bag due his books and class work copies.One day I struck upon an idea. As per his Half yearly and Annual syllabus, I separated the lessons in each subject and re-stitched his books.  This way I was able to reduce the weight of books to half. Now, my son feels lighter and happier.This is simple and easy and all parents can do it.It is pointless to carry whole book the whole year.

I am very happy to get an opportinuty to share my view as teacher regarding the education system and examination pattern. The old system of education was better than today's system. today's curriculum is not giving complete cognitive development to the child.it is believed that schooleducation is only a basis for getting job in future.

0 0 Dear Students,
For those who are in class X, this is the first time you are going to face Board Examinations. Your performance will be judged on the parameter of questions developed and checked by external teachers. So you have to work on all aspect of examination means Theory, Practice, Practical, Concentration, Time Management and Consistency.
For those who are in class XII, you have tasted board examinations in class X and are aware about the situations student face in those days.

0 0 Respected Narendra Modi ji,
In my view our education system should stress on overall development of the child. In the sense, our educations should make our students Physically ( through Yoga), Intellectually ( through Studies ), Morally and spiritually strong through education. Intellectually one can gain knowledge through various information sources but what I feel more important in the present scenario is moral and spiritual education which changes the mindset of the students.
0 0 Dear PM Modi Ji, Namaste, Please emphasize students
-To be a part of our nation's Growth story in the years to come.
-Please ask them to be positive towards nation ( not to listen to " kuch bhi chalta he " attitide)
-Please  lay foundation  in their mind to inculcate  " India first, India our nation " thinking and Constitution is the ultimate guideline.
-Please request students to be innovative  and achieve something for Country's Growth.

 Education will give u the knowledge of books where one must be prepare to face the life exam .Marks & grades cannot be judge any student caliber.

0 0 For Students,
1. As the examination date is near the students should refrain themselves from studying new topics. They should rather 'Revise by practicing extensively'(ROPE) what they have studied.
2. Practice Past year Ques Papers.
For teachers, They should avoid making statements which can loose the moral of students.
For Parents, They should tell the importance of education without stressing what could happen if they fail. The psychology should be to be optimistic yet conveying message.

Education system is the base of all systems. But from primary school level to IIT/IIM, the system is full corrupt. Hence the future of India is not bright.

My son Vivaan Kotnis (age 6 grade 1) had a drawing competition in school for Republic day. He drew on the paper and also wrote that Happy republic day and "make your policies more stronger". As a curious mom I asked him what policies would he like to change at this age and he told me 10 of them. He said I would like to send them to the PM's office to get his response. So I am attaching the letter he wrote to you in the PDF format.
Best Regards

0 0 Respected Sir,As you know Kendriya Vidyalayas specificaly provide quality education to the wards of Central govt employees from different regions of country.Its very painful if these students are not given proportional share in professional educational institutions and had to lose out to the criteria of regional reservation.With just 2% percent like in Gujarat state even the best in merit lose out.As students from state also study KVs proportional reservation would only do justice to all

As you know, an English proverb says"Justice to be done and it should be seen to be done"  Similarly, the govt. is doing lot of developmental works in India since assuming office. Most of the medias don't these for their own reasons.   There should be a TV [from party] to showcase the developments being done and people should really see those! Doordarshan is not sufficient.  Our own TV called Kamal[Hindi]Lotus[Eng] Thamarai [Tamil] should do this to highlight achievements! Namaskar!

I live in New Zealand but my heart is always work for India 24 hrs. Every year I see many students commit suicide after exam or after the results. This year I request you to add this area to motivate our children. By saying it never will be your last exam if you don't do good. If it will be from you then it's impact will be more and atleast some of the young lives we can save. As exams are always stressful in India but when I came here children enjoy schools more than holidays.

एक खास विषय पर आपने प्रतिक्रिया मांगी है.हम आभारी है.
परिक्षा मे सुधार तो लाना है.देश भर एक ही सिलैबस हो.जिसपर संशोधन और बदलाव लाने मे आसानी हो.अलग अलग विषयोंपर परिक्षा होनी चाहिए.बच्चे की अभिव्यक्ती जिस विषय पर है.उसको वही पे काम अभ्यास करने का मौका मिले.
सबसे महत्वपुर्ण बात यह है की,
आजकल टेक्नीकल शिक्षा की बहोत जरुरत है.उसके लिए परिक्षा कम मायने रखती है.जादा तो प्रात्यक्षिक Practical की जरुरत हो.आपका  और भारत वासियोंका जो सपना है.डीजीटल ईंडीया का वह जल्द जल्द साकार होने के लिए.

0 0 There are three main ways to face any examinations: Prepare prayerfully, Proceed positively, Pursue persistently. I took CBSE 10th & 12th finals in 2014 & 2016 respectively. Neither was it extremely challenging nor was it extremely easy for me to earn CGPA 10 & then 96.8%. Avoid memorizing without understanding the content. Understanding what you learn aids better recollection. Ask for help at the earliest. Eat & sleep well; health is wealth, especially during exam time. You can do it!

It's intuitive that students should be tensed during exams, being a student I would say, exams should be like carnival where students prove their skills. Our system gives little window to practical and even practicals are to be memorized the way they are written there is no room for inovation. Students should see implementation of concepts on platforms like youtube to supplement their preparation. CTET's result is worrying, it shows the burden on students and why Tution system is increasing

2. Do not panic

4. Stay focused.

Prepare the students in the area of Technology, Sports, Business,etc , so that they can make India PROUD.
All the  best for the students who are appearing for exams!!!!
0 0 sir,the idea of one common entrance exam for mbbs and engineering is a good one but if a student falls sick or any such mishap ,and is unable to appear for the exam on that date,entire year's efforts nd money would go waste which would lead to a lot of mental frustration.So ,like exams like SAT and GRE etc have more than one attempts in a year and best of all scores is taken....i suggest in our country also there should be 2 or 3 attempts allowed and best score should be the valid score.

0 0 Sir,  I think we should teach in our schools about how great our philosophy was than the western philosophy. How everything we achieved earlier in civilization, about which people are still researching. I really think our syllabus has to be redrawn. Since childhood a child should know about greatness of civilization he/she is a part of. Secondly i think knowledge is best learned in the language of his/her mother tongue. I request you to apply this at all stages of education both school & college

0 0 Hello sir, please reply my message
2 0 Dear Prime Minister, As a student in the past & parent now, I gist below few critical points with my exeprience reqd just BEFORE examinations:
AA) FOR PARENTS:
1. Never COMPARE your children progress in studies for the examination with other children's progress/method.
2. Never force children to score 100% in every subject & get First Class always.
3. Every student has his own talent.
BB) FOR STUDENTS:
1. Give your best to your ability.
2. Keep cool, clam & steady
3. Don't panic.
0 0 Must Read those appearing for any exams:
One more thing wants to add that is Emotional Intelligence. One of the most important parameters for all the students. Control their emotions through intelligence like Nervousness during exam hours, anxiety before the exam and more... Please talk to your Parents/Teachers about this. They may guide you in a better way.
Regards,
0 0 Hello Sir, I would like you to discuss the problems aspirants are facing now a days. Name an exam which is fairly conducted from JEE,PMT exams, SSC exams and many more. We have seen similar issues with CAT exams this year.
Associations like SSC have made mockery of job exams.True aspirants are unemployed because merit of exams like SSC-CGL is touching the sky.
I would like to know sir what steps are being taken to protect the interest of young, frustrated,unemployed and hardworking aspirants.
1 0 1. knowledge is power
2.we can also achieve good success if we use our free time and positive views.
3.teachers are like a candle that burns it  give the light of knowledge to the students.

0 0 society and family should not put more stress on student expecting more than what they deliver.
School/ college should live in realities of competitive world where performance of students are much below what they get in School.
school education should make more practical orientation where they learn how to earn and live dignified life in future.

1 0 If we have a universal basic income for all, the value of currency will get offset by that much amount. It's all demand and supply game which determines the value of currency and even exchange rates. Schemes like MNREGA provide for security to citizens. Humans must move to high value work. Automation machines are also made by companies which in turn are run by high paid humans.
0 0 Respected Sir, the students should have holistic approach while preparing for examinations.
0 0 Sir I suggest an online examination system for goverment school children. Schools have to be equipped with WiFi and TABs. Student can download a question paper from central server into his TAB for a scheduled examination with MCQs. Examinations may be three types. Class subjects, Psychology and IQ. Student can be assessed over a period. Even Teacher's and School performance can also be assessed. District Education Officer can be given the admin role to prepare the question papers.
0 0 I believe for getting admission into IITs/NITs coaching doesn't play the crucial role. It is not difficult for those, who really score outstanding in school exams. Knowledge is more important than anything. Guidance is required to prepared for IITs & NITs. Govt has started a forum with the help of IITs to help & support those students.

I am a special educator and teacher and writing to you for the second time.Sir,it gives me great enthusiasm to know your involvement in the future of our children.I suggest the following for our students taking exams.
Firstly - Believe in yourself.You need not score the best of marks to achieve in life.
Secondly - Don't think of getting into only blue collared jobs after college.Join our armed forces or Govt jobs where there are too many vacancies to make a change.
0 0 Sir, We are faced with a problem about encroachments on the common land of our coop society which though very simple, is not getting solved. We have wasted nearly 20 years with civil adm and 15 years with courts. If I am permitted, I will send it in letter form.
0 0 Respected Prime Minister
Today every student dream of getting into IIT'S and NIT'S. But it is really very difficult to get into these institutions without Coaching classes. This is not possible for every Indian student as they can't afford these classes. In fact according to my opinion the board marks must play some significant role for admission in this institutes as at least a poor student id capable of giving his best in boards.

0 0 Hey there....
Subjective exams have become so outdated nowadays because of their lack of actual intelligence-measuring capacity. Rather than measuring intelligence, it measures one's ability to mug-up the book and write the answers. Objective exams, on the other hand, measures the intelligence and the hard work done by him/her. You may argue that the student who may not have prepared may get lucky with the options. But the probability is very very less.

0 0 1.Exams at early stages like Nursery, KG should be given less importance and more emphasis must be placed on inculcating the right moral values like cleanliness, punctuality, discipline, honesty and inculcating a sense of belongingness for the country.
2.Special sessions should be organised for introducing kids to the freedom fighters and drawing inspiration from the life of great men like Swami Vivekanand, Rabindranath Tagore, to name a few.
3.Innovation should be encouraged.
0 0 cont'd, Sir kindly look into this matter, one suggestion is ,make some arrangements to monitor MBBS doctors preparing for PG entrance, console those who not get selected for the seats,by opening enough chances to work them for the people of the nation ,so that skilled human resource in one of  essential services will not get spoiled..like opening special recruitment office of that kind ,with efficient HR managers and social workers .looking forward as I myself one MBBS graduate in such situation
0 0 Honorable PM Narendra Modi,
As we are witnessing heavy snowfall in J&K and near LOC area, we are facing challenges and life risks for our soldiers protecting our borders. In recent times, many soldiers KIA due to avalanches. So, I would like to suggest that these soldiers must be provided by GPS unit for each individual specially one who are in Avalanche-prone areas, so that timely rescue is possible.
0 0 Instead of visiting foreign countries if you have visited the small towns of India and seen the problems faced by students,teachers,schools and common man and tried to instruct the authorities to improve it then it would have been more fruitful.Our children are still appearing for the exam with a fear in their mind to pass in the exam and not to excel in life.
0 0 Modiji we are talking about big promises.But do you think are we making our roots strong .No all the political parties keep on blaming each other just to prove that they are superior than others.But these parties are fighting for themselves and not for the people for whom they are got elected.You also try to prove that Kejriwal or Rahul Gandhi is like this or that but now you are elected the head of this nation by people then why do you represent any political party and why not INDIA only
0 0 1] The exam preparation is not only for 3 Hours of final exam.Read and forget type preparation.Please remember you are preparing for your life.
2] Short cut in preparation / keeping some optional is not right way.
3] Use Text book for syllabus and not guides just questions and answers. If you know/understand the subject No question remains question for you.
4] The exam system is foolish in nature for judging entire year in just few hours. Marks foes not matter , problem solving in real life

0 0 Being Tension free while going for exams is very important. Four hours before start of the exam no studying the answers. Being tensed, you will forget to recall the answer and can get panicky. In these four hours, closing your eyes, quickly go through images of pages you have studied, recall where you have scored good marks for which answer, one sentence answers etc. But in no way try to recall full big answers.
Parents should not set expectations while child going for exams.
0 0 Being a teacher for the past 30 years, I would like to share my ideas on the study environment at home or hostels.Just I request the parents/in-charges to introspect are they giving a calm, peaceful study environment to their wards? Observe ,the children maintain dignity themselves at Our temples,mosques, churches and other holy places because the environment influences and control their minds.In a same way, their study room or place also should be maintained and self motivated.

Instead they should force their child to use book knowledge and try something new. Such child focussed on Innovation will be more successfully even with low marks.

0 0 Every student and parent must think about exam as a test to the knowledge on a subject matter a kid posses rather than comparing themselves with other students , based on these result students and parents must have a healthier discussions on the interest and future of students. because of the stress on scoring higher marks we most often produce more machines with mechanical behaviors than Dr.Abdulkalam, Aryabhatta who were free mind thinkers with eagerness of knowledge not forced upon knowledge.

0 0 I was a student in St. Joseph's High School Thalassery and later I worked as a teacher in Maharashtra Udaygiri College Udgir. Both these institutions produced good results in exams.

Instead of saying walking is good for health say there are only two good doctors in the world - your right leg and your left leg.

I am Jayapal from Dharmapuri in Tamilnadu.  In my opinion conduct of examinations are required for a student to get graduated.  However it has become a nightmare for most of the students and those appearing for the competitive examinations because the examination results determine their future. Therefore a craft class is needed from the primary school level for the purpose of identifying the real talent a student is having.  He should be groomed in that particular skill.
0 0 sir myself Damodar sahoo from odisha,My opinion upon the exam preparation is,student should know their syllabus before the start of preparation,they need to have the particular talent for the exam,if they don't have it,then perpare for it before to prepare for the exam.after being prepare for the exam thoroughly.they need to, before sometime of the exam,revise all what they have learn don't try to study early before the exam only revise what u have learn.........thats the key to be successfull.

0 0 Sir, Exams are very important in every student's study period. There are only 3 simple tips for writing any examination effectively to achieve a great success. They are: 1. Very good preparation prior to examination; 2. Understanding the questions and recollecting the information from memory to write; 3. Answering all the questions with very good presentation and time management.
0 0 Respected Sir, Today is Republic Day. Happy Republic Day. Witnessed the grand function of Rajpath on TV. My best wishes to the students appearing in forthcoming exams and hope all the students pass out with flying colours. Good and Quality education is the foundation of any economy. Apart from formal text book education, more emphasis should be on moral education so that the future generation respect others, respect the laws of country and come out as great citizens of this great Country
0 0 I am a teacher and working in one of the reputed school in Pune Just wanted to inform you that in our school we don't have Hindi as a subject in +2 level(ISC Board). If you could make it a compulsory language that will be very good for our country and for our kids.
Some of the children want to take it in Higher Secondary level but unavailability of the subject bound them to take some other subjects unwillingly.
Waiting for some positive action.

0 0 Sir, students of today are too stressed by exams, and exams seem to have taken over every aspect of their lives. Forced to study 5-6 subjects (out of which they will have no further use for 2-3 in their working lives), they are unable to focus on their chosen subject out of fear of failing. To make life easier for them, I suggest they are allowed to choose the subjects with which they aim to make a career. Thanking you in advance. A concerned parent.

Most of the students are studying too much for competitive exams and gradually the Brain becomes less receptive.

This would help in developing a Bond of belonging of ordinary People with  Repuclic of India.

0 0 Namaste ModiJi!I am M.Tech student at IIT Gandhinagar,Gujarat.I think that students cannot succeed in exams only by studying.They should have constant support from their parents and teachers.They should not be compared or pressurised for good marks.Their elders should show faith in them and constantly tell them that failing is not the end of life.They should learn how to get up after falling.When the students will stop fearing the exams,they'll certainly do better.This is my personal experience.

0 0 Dear Mr. PM,have you ever wondered why exam should be stressful for kids/youngsters. Current education system does not focus on imparting knowledge to kids but train them for rat races. You may argue that with a billion population competition is inevitable and with competition comes stress.

Can you pls take steps to revive this system from a business model to service model?

0 0 Being in the field of teaching for over 35 years and being a parent of well settled children, the best way to prepare the students appearing for all kinds of exams is to instill 'feel good factor' which wil automatically reduce the anxiety, fear and tension among the students. "Koi aasman tapakke padnewala nahin' should be conveyed to them if their results do not match their expectations. Give all the freedom that they ask provided they are assertive, otherwise guide them with professional help

Can your government mandate every bright students getting graduated under the government support, scholarship or financial assistance must deliver 30hrs to 50hrs lecturer per annum in the schools located in the rural. Also, make a system in the education that a volunteers can come forward and registered to be a guest teacher and deliver teachings at free of cost.

I am a medical teacher and teach in a Govt Medical College in Kerala. As a teacher I feel that for a student, there is no substitute for hard work.

We should should be able to do better than them. Albert Einstein has said" Genius is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration"!

0 0 'Manifestation of divinity' as explained by Swami Vivekananda means understand one's aptitude towards a subject,gain confidence to express new ideas and acquire the skill to put them to good use. However the reality in India  is; marks really matter. Education transforms  students into 'mark scoring machines'. Therefore begin by  answering old question papers. Refer notes & textbook and take time to write long answers to score 100% instead trying to beat the clock. Write well during preparation.

Future of India lies in the hands of our students. If they have merit and good moral values as enshrined in our culture, India will be safe, progressive, powerful and at the top. When they are preparing for annual examinations, they should keep in mind three basic factors for success – dedication, concentration and self-confidence. Dedication means to set apart maximum time for the cause in hand that is preparation for examination.

i would request to request to make all school digital.any student should not carry any single book to school. they should have tab & laptop according to there standard.
Note
1) All Text Book and note book should be digital.
2) All Subject Chapters should be like a movie which will make student to remember the chapters easily
3) Exam & Result should be online. on TAB & LAPTOP
4) Result should be displayed real time. like we give RBI Job exam now a days {Egg BSE & NSE EXAM}

So that I guess this govt can infoem us the procedure to avail this 2 lakh.I cannot see my father in distress since bank started asking us to payback loans.We dont have water to go for farming now.Drought relief amount will never reach us.I have already informed govt that the schemes r not reaching farmers since there is no app to get to know the schemes for farmers.Also If I need a Pan card I can apply online.But If I need to apply for farming schemes I cannot.
0 0 My father is a farmer.He earning for the last 25 years with 4 acres is 5 lakhs and a loan amount of 5 lakh. During the Congress last 5 year term our loan was not cancelled because we were continuosly paying dues.Loans were cancelled for the persons who r not paying dues properly but having land more than us.Now we have taken loans from friends of 12 lakh to construct home since our land documents r with bank. We cannot apply for 2 lakh amount given for farmer home construction since proof n bank

A humble request: While UK, Germany & US are teaching Sanskrit & slokas to kids outside Bharat why aren't we making this compulsory for minimum 5 years of Sanskrit in schools. Parents can opt out for 5 out of total 10 years. And introduce teachings of Vedas, Yogas, meditation as an inherent mechanism to cope with societal challenges rather than revolving all around pay and positions in careers! Opposition is never going to support this but Country is with you.

0 0 Modiji,I think exams are important in life but at the same time they are not that important. If the concentration of the students is on the concept rather than on exams then it will be much more beneficial to the students as well as our country.

Due to carelessness of authorities students have been punished ..our 3 years , hard work , lakhs of fees and most importantly our dreams , everything is ruined.
0 0 Respected Prime Minister. Board examinations are fast approaching and children are under tremendous tension. Is it not because of weightage given to certain courses especially science courses. The child who studies Arts or Commerce is less tensed. Therefore I suggest that in the school level itself children should be taught about various avenues with respect to each course of study. And parents too to be given knowledge about each course.This reduces parents worry & make children tension free.
0 0 I am preparing for govt jobs exams last 3years.If you can give jobs to one candidate,It means you have done well for at least 5 other persons also (His whole family will be happy whole life).Please look to youth.Youth do not want anything except for job. We studied, but we are still jobless. We can't move to private sectors because they are just ready to make harassment of us(By low salary/work overload). Please provide us lots of opportunity in govt sector. We are ready to fight competition.

0 0 I have seen that Many state government release his vacancy advertisement only in its regional language so that other people could not apply for that post OR they ask for knowledge of regional language. That is wrong. I am the citizen of India, I must be free to apply to any state's vacancy. You should do something for it. As all students can understand english language. A state should not divide on the basis of language.

0 0 Honorable PM,
My suggestions are
Make all studies application-based and based on creative and logical ability.
Allow children to specialize in a subject from the fifth grade itself.
Give a variety of options that can be studied, and not only Science, Commerce or Humanities.
Make education compulsory till the age of 17.
Place more emphasis on entrepreneurial and innovative abilities.
Make special provisions for children who are differently abled.

0 0 *   Stop tuition system and increase the teachers salary.  Because of the tuition system 80% of teachers don't teach in school.  Students get hard time from teacher when students don't go tuition.
*   Take the test of teacher every year - Teachers must have to give exam of the area what they going to teach.  If teacher fail the exam then they can not teach that level.

By giving them ATKT student never improve that area and students stay weak for the lifetime.B if students are not good in 2-3 subjects, do not let students to repeat hole standard again.  Students can move up on other subject but they have to take same subject in next semester which they are weak.  Fox example in USA, in same Math class they have different standard of students.

In regards to youngsters appearing for exams. First of all, Why do we have to judge kids capability in earlier age. Why can't we remove the exam for child who studies from Jr K.G. to 3rd or 4th standard. Make them first aware of how to be discipline and educate on all basic aspects. Make Sports important subject.

1 0 Dear Narendra Modiji,
When i used debit card to pay utility bills i also had to pay an extra amount as service tax for using card. When our idea is to  try and move to less cash economy and when i saw people still using cash then i think this may be the one of the reason. If digital payments are going to attract taxes and if anybody will have to pay more than the prescribed bill amount then very less people will use it.
Hence please act upon it to encourage digital payment.

0 0 Examination preparation is a phycological pressure on students as well as parents also....but in examination time parents role become very important.

Examinations are important as they evaluate the skill levels of the individuals.
But i would very much like the Government to evaluate on the portion being taught in schools. Is it in standards with the standards followed in other countries.

6. Make positive affirmations such as "My memory is good, I have studied well, I will achieve my targeted goals in advance etc"
7. Visualize your goal
8. Remain relaxed all the time

0 0 Should there be a debate to conduct USA SAT like exams in India for college education instead of giving much importance to board exams and entrances?

Being a student of class 11 and an aspirant of IIT-JEE it is my keen request to reduce the burden on calss 11 and class 12 students. Despite of reducing burden and shorting syllabus new subjects and rules are being introduce which lefts students in DILEMA. Another major point is vote-bank basedbon reservation system,Being a class 11 student I am not much into it.
The result of reservation is breaking moral of GEN category and a speed breaker in pace of country's development.-Vedant N.S.
1 0 Our nation gives lot of importance to education and skills. But we have to question ourselves why our professionals like scientists, engineers, doctors,writers,leaders are not competing at the international levels?

We have to thankful for the developed nations for their technology,talent and skills and there is an urgent need to improve the standards in Indian education system.
0 0 respected PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI SIR,
              nowadays education system is becoming the money based system which was value based earlier. I can not understand why the system has changing in such a way. coming to the examination system frankly speaking that the exam system is also based on rich and poor because the so called rich colleges get the easy of getting out in exams compared to a normal government schools/colleges. just before some days back one MP of AP proved EDU' IS FAKE.

        I am an engineering graduate from Karnataka,I want to discuss the actual condition of an Engineering graduates in many states of India.
1)The syllabus taught for BE,B.tech etc in most of Indian university's are outdated and Industry's outside the college campus expect a skilled engineer.
2)People born in poor,rural background and born in General cast are the worst sufferers
we don't have fees exemption for applying Govt job, We don't have age relaxation etc
1 0 Dear sir,
I would like to bring in notice below point which I feel should be addressed in the education policy eventually it will reduce the exam pressure on the students.
1. Standardise the syllabus across the education boards. Focus should be on what's required TO LIVE THE LIFE. Presently, 90% of education goes on waste in real life.
2. Fix the limit for the weight of the bags for primary kids. Due to school's lust the no. of books are being increased year by year.

0 0 Dear PM, I want to draw your kind attention to Exam Fee as well as Age Relaxation Exemption in between General, OBC and SC-ST to fill the form in so many exam. I Thought such discrimination should be remove from the Examination. Because a young Talented who belongs to any category should have a capability to fight the exam without any extra exemption and the same should be applicable at the time of Cutoff marks of Exam. More the difference more the young talented back.

(i)Students should prepare well, use optimize resources and then give their exams with out any fear. They should be in positive bend of mind.
(ii)In case, God-forbid, even if they fail or score less marks they should not loose hope because that is not the end of the road. Rather they should re try and bounce back with flying colours.
Also, wanted to emphasized that our current education is more as mucking system rather than knowledge gain system.

0 0 Respected Sir,
One main point some students miss during the preparation of the examination is the exam orientation. Their preparation must be oriented according to the exam. It is correct that we must explore a topic which we are reading and go deep into it. But during exam preparation also , some students go so deep into the topic that they forget the exam orientation and the importance  of that topic in the examination, hence they have less time for other important topics.
1 0 Dear Sir,
For Teachers- Teachers should treat, support, be warm be sincere towards students,they should help them prepare for exams just as if they are preparing their own child for the exam.
For students- Students should either meditate or go to religious place, natural place whatever soothes them for at least 5 minutes everyday.
Parents and Students- Weather is changing students to take care by avoiding outside food and cold drinks, stick to healthy diet.

Schools need to teach and guide students to face Board exams and other exams like NEET, JEE etc. I suggest Private coaching centers/tution centers are not needed.
It is
1.Extra burden to students
2.lack of time to take care health (less sleep, no physical exercises, always pressure)
3. Extra expenses to parents.
At present, because of tutions, many schools are not  teaching. Tution going students get good marks compared to others. This trend needs to change.

I really admire your concept of connecting to the masses of India through Mann Ki Baat. I have following ideas:
1. Go early to the bed, have sufficient sleep, and get up early in the  morning. Before starting studies, a few minutes of deep breathing Pranayam would be of great help.
2. Take regular breaks in between studies.
3. Be regular with studies to avoid last minute rush
4. Relax your mind with some physical exercise/ game everyday.
5. Have limited access of social media.

I would like to suggest some important steps to be taken for the students with disability. First of all, the examinations like IIT-JEE, Board exams etc. should be conducted in such a way that it should examine the 'Knowledge' of a candidate rather than his/her physical competence with other students. This can be done in the form of relaxations given to divyangs like more quota in computer science in IIT, writer for more than 80% disabled in all the  exams.

0 0 Sir, I request you, for single exam in Philosophy of Doctorate admission, like in Medical(NEET) and in Engineering(AIEEE etc.). Because many times students have keen interest in research do not know how to engaged with an research organisation or university of their interest, due to different admission criteria everywhere. Some institute wants GATE/NET qualified candidates while some some conducted their own written examination, these things creates problems to the students.
0 0 Respected Sir;
   Agreeing to the suggestions given by others , I would like to add that , finding suitable job is the biggest hurdle every youngster is facing . The term 'suitable' relates to job opportunity to the person for what he is qualified to and salary based on his qualification.
Today me being an engineer, have under gone this phase and have seen many such engineers who work in other jobs for a petty amount. Even if the person gets job in right domin, the growth is limited.

There is a desi,authentic and affective way to deal with these pressure from our culture that is gita,kuran,bible. Reading them can cure all problem. Also government should make compulsory in schools to teach students about these holy books.
0 0 Sir
     During examinations time as a parent should support their wards in a positive manner.They must encourage them and move with friendly aspects.
As a student,understand the importance of exam and prepare well. They should not waste time.
As a teacher,they must motivate their students and especially they must take care of weak students and give attention to them.

0 0 Dear Sir, your govt launched the UDAAN program for promoting technical education of girl students and is fulfilling its purpose. It will have a very good long term results. However Sir the fee scholarship to the students takes a long time to actually reach the students. For students of 2016-17 the subsidy is not yet cleared with one semester already completed. Plans can be more implementable to serve the purpose. Regards.
0 0 I would like to thank you our prime minister for giving me this opportunity to share my thoughts.
Problem statement: -Teachers, students, and parents are not aware of various career opportunity available.
Possible solution: -Teachers should be trained to guide students in the various career opportunity and how to prepare for the same. Information should be given by teachers in schools before 10th class. parents should be made aware of this careers.
1 0 Sir,I am Jyoti Prava jema,a bsc 3rd year student,Ramadevi women's university,from odisha.Now a days most of the parents preferring English medium school for their children. Especially schools under cbsc Bord. But there is no subject in cbsc Bord containing regional information. For which students remain unaware about their own state. For example pupils studying in school under cbsc Bord in odisha do not know about the history,geography or literature of odisha. I think it is a huge drawback.

0 0 Good afternoon PM sir, Iam from Bangalore and very proud to share my thought with a man who has always with a lot of strong messages, decisions and is restless to do more & more for our nation.
Sir Iam a father of 12 th std student and with forthcoming board exam. My thought is that 'the time has come to take strong step to control/stop the growing tuition system as parallel running with upperclass school edn'. Parents, Students and Teachers are in confusion & unable to achieve good results.
0 0 I have of course written a lot of exams and now , my children do.
While exams, do help students learn, the way they are constructed, sometimes it seems your luck is tested as much as your knowledge. I have also found teachers not encouraging originality.It is a stressful time, for all.  I hope something can be done to make education seem like something to help people learn and grow rather than just acquire certificates.
0 0 very good.

 Your emphasis for the Public sector research institutions to encourage students have been complied only on paper, with their sites putting encouraging messages for internship but nil response is there on application by students. Need to transform this into actionable reality.
     Sir,student fee subsidy/reservation on caste basis even by financial sound parents needs to be appealed to voluntarily give up the subsidy for better channelising of funds.

This will promote equality and will encourage the aspiring professionals to serve building our nation dutifully.

Kindly look into this matter and bring a system in place where there is a restriction and regulation on private schools charging high fees in schools and colleges.  No question of saving some money for the future if we have two kids studying in a private school.  Thanks.
0 0 Respected Sir, Kindly consider to change our educational system and timing as well. also private institutes charges on students.
0 0 sir, they are trying to detain children who had learning disability though the board accepts them with concessions, the schools in order to get a 100% first class result , trying to keep them in 9th or 11th itself so that their results will not be affected. This demoralizes the child and many commit suicide or go into depression, hence the school managements are to be warned against this kind of discrimination

0 0 Entire Education System is in shambles since the Ministry of Human Resources (Department of Education) is unable to monitor and control either the corrupt University Grants Commission or the Universities or the affiliated Colleges, etc. There is rampant corruption and nepotism in Admission procedures, and also in the Examination systems.

0 0 Hon. PM Sir,
The biggest issue which students must tackle during exam time is fear. It has direct bearing not only to performance in exams but also self-worth. Every student is much more concerned about his/her future than parents know of. They not only want to be part of nation building in future but also need recognition. Some students can cope with this fears but others find it difficult. Those who cannot, a word of encouragement and assurance that they will not be left behind will help.

 It is required to be free in education current system bind us. We are just passed with questions which are never solved. There are some terms which should be changed. So we can study free to help country,instead of just passing exams for job.

0 0 Teachers must act as Lord Krishan in lives of their students and motivate Arjuns ( Students ) to work without tension of results of success or failure.
To students - I would like to suggest , be hard-workers and honest. Do not copy or imitate others , try to create something in any field. Observe , learn , listen , read , play , contemplate as much as you can. Respect time , respect elders. Albert Einstein had said that "A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new".

Sir I have made a project which is based on problem arising from Technology the whole world is in under this problem.This problem is mainly found in telecommunication sector and India is in 114 place.so I want to meet you to discuss about this problem & I have solution
0 0 Teachers must always teach the students the lessons of hard-work and honesty. The life of a student with the wheels of hard-work and honesty will surely reach to the expected goals of the life. Be fair to all students , share your experiences. Keep broad options of career in their lives. Do not stick to limited options in career-making. Tell them that the world is an ocean of opportunities , just be confident and grab the best opportunity.
0 0 Exams are stressful times for students,  when competition is increasing and demands from parents are also high. I would suggest schools should have extra tution provisions for clearing doubts even if it is with some fee. Secondly,  the carrer counselling should start in school from pre HSC levels to give direction to individual aspirations.
0 0 Just provoke your kids to work hard. In Sri MadBhagwad Geeta - The Karam is considered the best irrespective of the result of the Karams done. All players in a game , do not win , only one wins , it does not indicate that other players should not play. Try for better. If your kids will prepare for exams with free minds , they will certainly do better.
For the teachers -- I would like to suggest that they should teach lessons of hard-work and honesty to your students.
0 0 respected sir i witnessed suggestions pour in however discarded requested to the gov that reduce the prevailing inequalities and corrupt practices in the following fields which are divided into several underground layers of social economic divisions

i though an ignou student thus unemployed.
people --divide and rule policy. i could suggest to remove prevailing inequalities and bring development in the field concerned.call me!
0 0 Higher Education should be subsidised completely to enhance the intellectual capital of our country. Presently only the rich can afford top institutions and become richer. Skills are a must, but should come with a degree to enhance employment opportunities. The disparity in income may reduce when higher education becomes completely subsidised for all i.e no tuition fee. Economically weak may send their children to school when higher education is also free.
0 0 The examination days are drawing near - some students are excited and some are in fear.
As a parent - I would like to advise the parents/guardians of the students that never pressurize your wards to bring high percentage in exams. Just motivate them to do good and try for better but never expect high performance from your wards. It will mentally tease the students and if you do not get expected results , you too will be depressed. in depression , you will scold your child and spoil your image
0 0 Respected Pm you are working proper and very good
0 0 The PM shall try to elucidate on focusing and dedicating one's psyche entirely to education.
    Examinations are taken or given to catch the exceptions,anomalies or loopholes in one's knowledge.It makes us know the areas where we are fallacious and that which most necessarily needs care and attention.Examinations should be taken in a spirit of finding the erroneous points in our knowledge and not simply in a materialist light i.e. simply with an intention to get good grades .
0 0 Education shapes a nation.
Strenuous study reveals where we are especially weak at.When the examinations come very close, we get tensed and this makes us all the more focused at work.However,deviations from study play the most vital role in deciding one's fate.During this period ,it is greatly difficult to acclimatize our mind to the environs that seem precarious and perilous.Time seems to fleet bit by bit.With hardly a month left behind the board exams , it is becoming obsessing ,to cope up.

Why can't we bring in best practices of educational system across the world? In Singapore, board examinations are evaluated by whole staff by providing one week holidays to the whole children in that school. Written examination have only ~50% scoring, Student's communicational skills, behaviour, sports, general knowledge, current affairs etc are being evaluated.
Can we adapt the below actions as a start....
 Till 7 years no written exam in any schools
0 0 There must be a kind of self assessment test every year mandatory for every teacher. Very often we come to know that a teacher is not able to answer the basic questions related to their subject. If they don't know these basic thing what they will teach to their students. So it must be mandatory for teacher to pass that performance test every year to make sure that they know what they are supposed to teach their student. Also please remove caste based reservation at least from education system.

Most Important point to be taken care by candidate is " No fear of failure". Most of the students have fear of failure while appearing for exams. They should forget about their past failure and have faith on themselves. I will my example in this case : Even though I have got 39% marks in Higher Secondary, I have cleared Chartered Accountancy Final Exams.
1 0 sir we should take steps towards quality education and removal of reservation based on cast 50% reservation does not make any sense. And  it is not good for the developing India.teachers must use some creativity while teaching if the teaching is creative than only the students are creative. teachers have to pay attention on very individual student.Our education system need some instant changes like to make education interesting and creative.

0 0 Honorable Prime Minister, As a teacher and a paper evaluator, I wish to put forth the following comment to the students. Please convey the same on my behalf
As far as possible, write answers to questions in chronological sequence only. For e.g. write Ans. 2 after Ans. 1, then Ans 3, so on and so forth. Leave some space for Ans. 2 if you don't know. Then come back later and answer it. If you write answers in random order, you are confusing the evaluator, who may forget to add up some marks.

0 0 Dear sir,
First thing  you changed the system of education by starting with practical and then come to theory  and not reverse . Also education should  make student self dependent , whcih is not happening right now , Remove all  reservation for marks for getting admission , in  todays world does it really make sense . Education minister should be from IITian with  IIM background , who understand the education need with management skills . Teach for India can give good inputs here.
0 0 प्रधानमंत्रीजी मेरा ये सुझाव है कि शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में हमें सबसे ज्यादा सुधार की जरूरत बेसिक और मध्यमिक स्तर पर है। मुझे ये लगता है कि इस समय इस स्तर पर रटने पर ही कक्षाओं में ज़ोर दिया जाता है न कि उनके तार्किक ज्ञान पर। हमें आज आवश्यकता है कि उनका व्यावहारिक ज्ञान भी बढ़ाया जाय और इसके लिए आवश्यकता है कि इस स्तर पर प्रयोगसाला और पुस्तकालयों की भी स्थापना भी स्कूलों में की जाय।

1 0 My sister got AIR 716 in Aipmt2015 and secured admission in BYL Nair Hospital, Mumbai. Her friend who got AIR~1000 couldn't get admission due to lack of seats. However a 'reserved category' candidate (not economically backward) whose marks are worse than an AIR10000 student and whose basic concepts of biology are also not clear secured admission easily. Is this fair? What kind of doctor is he gonna be? Aren't you compromising health of citizens? Does 51% caste based reservation make any sense?

      4. The activites, which are giving to the children are in a way that they should be helpfull to develop the child's overall personality develepment
0 0 Dear Sir,
I have few suggestions and concerns w.r.t to education system.
1. Schooling should start only after age of 5, focusing on health, self defence and moral values.
2. There should be only one Board for all schools " one country one school".
3. Nursery,UKG, LKG etc should be scraped.
4. school should not be allowed to take original birth certificate.
5. Fees, book, uniform should be one for all govt schools.
6. Teachers should be well payed so they can focus on education.
0 0 प्रधानमंत्री सर आपसे एक निवेदन है की आप मेरे इस बात पर जरूर धयान देंगे सर मेरा ये कहना है की सर अभी भी बहुत से ऐसे गांव है जंहा पे स्कूल नही है लेकिन उस गांव में बहुत से ऐसे नौजवान है जो पढ़ कर भी बेरोजगार है तो सर क्यों नहीं ऐसे नौजवान को प्रोत्साहित किया जाय और गांव में भी उसी नवजवान के द्वारा स्कूल का संचालन हो इससे दो फायदे होंगे पहला की गांव को स्कूल मिलेगा और बेरोजगार को रोजगार आशा करते है की आप इस बात पे जरूर धयान देंगे

It is not outcome based education the youth needed but it is value and ethical based education.   What I strongly believe is that one subject ought to be introduced on value-ethical based along with an hour a week for sports and an hour for arts where the student experiences the joy of hardworking, creative thinking and learns winning strategies and implements in his own life. and the above said subject shapes his overall attitude which  develops a dreamed nation.

1 0 Respected sir,
   I am in the final year of my graduation and want to pursue LLB after it; so I could help in building a crime free India. But there is a problem cause I belong to a middle class family and the college is nearly 25-26 km far away from my village. I can't go there regularly,not because it is too far but because it s not safe.Tell me what should I do?
And my parents aren't allowing me to take Education Loan(they think it's waste of money) but in my Marriage they surely would.

This is regarding JEE advance exam. I followed your office and HRD office for providing ladies quota for admissions in Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) through JEE advance exam.
Just few days back we come to know that there will be 20% reservation for the ladies for the admissions in IIT. Thank you. However, this year it will be implemented in IIT Delhi only. I request you to provide ladies quota from this year only in all IITs for the betterment of girls as it was long due.

0 0 Respected Prime Minister,
sir I am a Private teacher. In my opinion . agar hum student ko piratical shikha dea saktea to acha hota. like if we want to measure a cube then only we calculate it mathematically but we did not measure it piratically therefor students are forgot it in the exam. In history we only Reade past things which we never seen but if we seen this we rememberer it. how to seen ? we seen it as a movie or like a serial in the class room. as a result student a more attactive

0 0 Respected PM
We all are thankful to you that you have taken this topic of discussion in "Man ki Baat".I have a humble request to you more & more attentions should be given on the grass root level of education.At present scenario the students don't have enough basic knowledge about the practical fields of life,all the students are just running in race,no one is worried about the knowledge,they all are only running for win,that's it.
Make aware the school education about the concepts of study
0 0 My observation is on Food distribution system under Food Securities Act of Government of India in our state West Bengal, North 24 Parganas is worst. Maximum number of Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) Ration Card holders are not poor as they pretend to be. The quality of food is very poor, so they are using this food for their pets, as they are not in (BPL).AAY Ration Card provided to this group of People by the Political influence because they will cast vote and provide advantages to the ruling party
0 0 Dear Sir,
You are doing a great job.But lets talk about the youngsters.Today's youth are getting distracted and we are terrorizing ourselves.The number of crimes are actually increasing.Sir ,I request you to take certain steps for the betterment of our nation by focusing on youths.Today's Youth must not only be educated by formal Education but also by Moral education.I think the Books written by Shree Swami Vivekananda must be distributed in Educational institutes for INDIA's betterment.
0 0 1. Students should not take stress about the exam and should do meditation 2 to 3 times a day to relax mind. This will also help to improve their graspping power.
2. Regular study throughout the year helps them to achieve good percentile in exam. They should understand the subject instead of just memorizing it.
3. They should take light food, drink plenty of water and also do other activities like playing, gossiping, watiching TV etc. apart from study to relax mind.

1 0 Respected PM Sri. Narendra Modiji,
Kindly tell students that exams are not so important. Children should learn in a very peaceful manner. All these exams are bringing stress in the minds of children. We have reached a situation where children are focusing only exam not on improving the knowledge. We have hear lot of children/students commit suicides because of failed in the exams.
Exams are not important for child. We need to change the old British way of dealing every thing.
0 0 Respected Prime Minister,
   We know the sunlight scatters in all the directions. The scattered light cannot burn a piece of paper. But the same light when we made it pass through a convex lens, it burns a piece of paper. Because the total energy of light is converged at a point. The student should focus on academics.
  A cow has a good quality called rumination. The student should recall the academic content all the time except while sleeping.
  perseverance is the secret of success.
0 0 Respected Modiji,
Project given by school need to be completed in schools only and school want it to get done at home .  It lost children's play time. There should be a Sports school from std I like koria, Japan and china to have a healthy generation of India.
0 0 I am delighted that our beloved Prime Minister, who is thinking 24 X 7 about all of us in the country has chosen examination about children very aptly and timely.  Sir, examination/competition creates discrimination among children.  Every children is unique and our present exam system does not follow a pattern to identify the uniqueness of each child.  Hence my suggestion is to please follow a process where we can be able to identify those potentials with each individual and feel proud. Biren

0 0 First we should focus on education system which is completely british , this system focused on Degree not for education , so this would create the tension for student and their parents .  the education system should be such " which not disturb parents "   mind please no scientist in the world can focused on all subject ..........  so first we should focused on system
0 0 Being a Parent I want to share my problem. For student of Std. IV to VIII schools assigns many projects which students can not complete of their own. Some topics are so hard and students can not complete it and parents has to complete the  whole things.  Being a working parents it's difficult to arrange time in working days.  School also expect projects to be done with attractive presentation along with quality contain. Please give surprise visit and see whether students can do project alone.
0 0 Private owned schools force parents to buy uniform, books and stationary from school itself that on Maximum Retail Price (MRP). Its not a hidden fact but still no action from government has been taken. Also, all private schools are free to decide fees amounts, annual charges etc. Is it allowed under some law of government of India?? Schools have published that each pupil has to pay fees under this law but what about deciding fees amounts???

0 0 Before making entrance exams such as NEET/JEE mandatory, please ensure that all state board curriculums and syllabuses have been upgraded.
This will remove the anxiety of thousands of aspiring students studying in state board schools, as the students will not have to join any extra classes or private coaching centres to prepare for the examinations.

0 0 Dear All,
Exam time is the best time of education, To most of the students Firstly I Congratulate and wish them All the Best In Advance,
Just like our Gurukul Culture I would first advice students to avoid oily & Heavy foods which will slow down digestive system, Remember if the digestive system is under load the brain will concentrate more on digestive system, Have Plenty of water to have proper ionic and free blood flow, this helps you in memorising
Secondly Avoid late night studies.
0 0 Government Schools all over India needs dedicated attention and focus. Central schools owned by government have better facilities than other government schools due to reason that government employees children get education but what about general public of country because of whom government is there. Education in society will transform our society and way of living.
0 0 In developed countries like USA and UK, they conduct common test for all students those who clear either 10th/12th standard, if they clear the exam, they can join with the universities they like most irrespective of their basis studies, for example a commerce student can study science/engineering course, similarly a science student can study any commerce, cost accounting,company secretary and LAW courses, but it is not a case in India, why don't we think of that sort and implement in India.
0 0 Sir,I am very happy because sir I never seen like our priminister and lthink now our country more progress and developed.I thanked from my heart to our priminister.
0 0 To release our youth of stress of exams Syllabus should made more flexible and multi choice questions should be there like do any 10 questions out of 20.
0 0 The present education system lack civic sense and character building. Syllabus up to VIII standard contain tough study material. Which confuse students as to for what they are getting this education. Education should relate to knowledge which we need in our day to  day routine life and not like that we want to be specialized in all fields. Then a Cardiologist will not be a cardiologist rather he will not be able to treat cardiac patients nor ortho patients. Our educated youth violate rules.
0 0 Sir, Somewhere our schools are losing the ability to motivate the children for education and preps for the exams. especially the Board exams. Result is a phobia for the Boards amongst the students. I suggest that curriculums for Std X and XII should be amended to have more participation of school in Board exam preparation, guidance, encouragment, which will be part of Board exam internal marks also. This way Students would be motivated and we also reduce the cases of depressive incidents.
0 0 Sir, Please ask the students not to take tension. Our teachers used to say ""Exams are not Kumbh Ka Mela Jo 12 Saal me ek Baar Aayega"", it will come on every year. If something wrong happens this year; don't worry give it (exam) next year. There is nothing great will happen if you loose one year in life. Life it beautiful enjoy it. Don't worry about exams. Do your work and don't take tension of result. God will do justice with every body.
1 0 Students appearing academic exams should think that they are only answering questions as per their course curriculum and not taking exams for the very good values which they have.Always errors/failures are part of real life and these can be solved by your real good qualities that you have built up within you during your young/childhood period.So parent should not be very much worried academic failure of their children, rather they should always give more emphasis on developing noble values
0 0 Exams are meant to test the overall development of a person. But it is never a measure to actually see the true potential, rather it is just a measure for how can one react in the situation when you know something and you can do it or not, which is again dependent on the situation and hence it is just a common perspective. The overall development is a personal task and hence it does not need to be shown off for just the world but it should be done to gain knowledge, rest of things will follow.
0 0 Students who have been preparing for the exam through out the year will have to increase their effort during this last phase of the academic year.Success will be theirs.Students who have NOT prepared for their exams so far and have wasted their precious time through out the year,such students should understand that it is still NOT too late.There is a Proverb in English "If you TRY you might, but if you DON'T you won't".Take up tough subjects first and do better time management.Its still not too
0 0 for students -
"Once you entered the exam hall, take a long breath and relax.  When you get the paper in your hand don't be panic.  Read all the paper first and start writing whichever question you can answer quickly and once you settled down after writing the answer of first question you selected, then automatically you will get a spirit to write/solve all the remaining paper.  All the very Best."
Thank you Sir for sharing with you.

0 0 Time management is one of the major factor in Examinations. Students should understand on how to manage time properly. For this, the teachers should guide them from the beginning of the year. Teachers should show them what kind of questions they have to write first how much time they have to spend for that and how to write precisely and clearly. They have to students in Time management. Attached are few more tips for students from my view point.

0 0 Hello Sir, I will take this opportunity to share the thoughts of medical students, as I have been a part of it and now, though I have crossed all those entrance exams and working as a Doctor in Kolhapur city, I always wonder, that how can a 90 or 120 minutes' exam, with 200 or 300 multiple choice questions (MCQs), which are based on 4.5 years of 14 subjects syllabus, judge a Medical student's capability if they are eligible for further studies? Infact,India needs more and more specialist Doctors
