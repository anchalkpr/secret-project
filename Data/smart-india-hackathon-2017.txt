0 0 Respected Modiji,
All the government offices should have latest state of the art computerized systems for e.g. the General Post Office from Pune, where atleast 200 old people line up for getting their work done but each person has to wait for about 2-3 days before his/her number comes as the processing time for every person is about 30 Minutes to 1 hour approximately. On asking only one reply is received from the officials, that the computers and network are slow. Please help.

0 0 1) Speed breakers are the biggest hurdles in the economic development of any nation.
2) Speed breakers are the main reason of increase in traffic congestion and sluggish traffic.
3) They also cause backbone related medical problems apart from increasing the transportation time and frustration involved in transit on a daily basis.
4) Without speed breakers people will reach in shorter amount of time and will be in lesser hurry in a smoothly moving traffic.
5)All lamp posts should show timers.

0 0 The key to Digital India is the availability of low cost electric power in all villages. Power Generation and distribution is a challenge. Though the power ministry is focusing on providing electricity to all villages, however, having a low cost renewable power energy source in every village should be encouraged. The opportunities at village level are
Turning waste into electricity that can power up a village
Localized solutions for wind and solar energy to make villages self reliant in energy

5] Speed limits enough roads or block roads for vehicles

देश की आजादी के लिये अपना सर्वस्व समर्पित करने वाले लाखों लोंगों की भावनाओं के अनुरूप इस देश का निर्माण हो। हमें अपना व्यक्तिगत सहयोग इसमें प्राथमिकता के आधार पर देना चाहिए। बड़े बड़े राजनेताओं को भी आज भाषण देने से पहले क्रांतिकारियों के जीवन से प्रेरणा लेकर देश को सिर्फ भौतिक विकास ही नहीं बल्कि आध्यात्मिक व सामाजिक विकास की पहल करनी चाहिए।- कुलवीर बैनीवाल भारतीय |

0 0 DigitalIndia is dream to make India a super power, but this can't achieved without making telecom robust & outstanding, these days RCOM users are unable to make any calls and data is also flickering, how long will digitalIndia stand if pillars are so weak. Please make strong penalty policy for Telecom operators. So DigitalIndia project can speed up in dramatically.

0 0 I really appreciate such great motive of our respected PM sir. I get surprised when somebody asking how their old parents can get the modern system, like online services, cashless payments etc. There've somebody just try to ignore such modern system. The only cause is nothing but a fake panic in their mind. Actually they can not realize that a weapon can be more powerful with its right use. Just want to aware them a message that for a best community we have to accept the system in a right way.

0 0 जब सरकार के अनुसार 95% लोगों के पास आधार कार्ड है तो क्यों ना चुनाव भी आधार आधारित हो जाये।मतलब बायोमेट्रिक तरीके से अंगूठा लगा के पहले मतदाता का सत्यापन हो तब ही उसे वोट डालने दिया जाये।ये काम ऑनलाइन और ऑफलाइन दोनों तरीके से संभव है।सब कुछ पेपरलेस संभव है ना पर्ची छापने की जरूरत ना परची कटाने के लिए मतदाता को परेशानी होगी।
बस सभी बूथ पर बायोमीट्रिक मशीन की जरूरत होगी।इस तरह से भविष्य में लोग कही से भी खुद को ऑनलाइन रजिस्टर करवा के वोट कर पाएंगे।सुरक्षा का ख़तरा नहीं होगा और मत का % भी बढ़ेगा।

0 0 Telecom Compliance
As we all know that communication channel is the most critical part for the criminals and terrorists to operate. But, the current mechanisms and methods are not fool proof.
Currently, the mobile subscribers can only permitted to have 9 SIMs. But people are fooling the industry and subscribe as many as they wanted; particularly in the “Prepaid” segment.
