A system designed especially for recognizing the handwritings. Any stylus based inputting device can be used to input text using handwriting. All the stylus based devices provide basic data in the form of X-Y co-ordinates called as stroke/trace. This handwritten text in the form of stroke/trace is converted into editable text thus bypassing the need for a keyboard for text entry. This system uses handwritten recognition engine which is specifically trained on sample of handwriting styles.
