The Public Procurement Bill, 2012 was introduced in last Lok Sabha and was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance by the Hon’ble Speaker on May, 2012. No report was given by the Standing Committee and the Bill has since lapsed.
Finance Minister in his Budget Speech, 2015 announced (para 72) that the Parliament needs to take a view soon on the Public Procurement Law.
It has been decided to initiate stakeholders’ consultation to take the matter forward.  A copy of the Public Procurement Bill, 2012 is available on the website of Ministry of Finance and can be accessed at the following link: http://finmin.nic.in/the_ministry/dept_expenditure/ppcell/58_2012_LS_EN.pdf
All stakeholders are requested to review the existing provisions of the Public Procurement Bill and give their comments.
The last date for submission of your comments is 20th April, 2015.
