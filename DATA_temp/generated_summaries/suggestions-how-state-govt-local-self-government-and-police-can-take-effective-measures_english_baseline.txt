all state govt departments/ agencies to fall under this authority.
Best would be to have elected body in each distict of india and elements of the state govt such as PWD,medical ,education ,police and revenue collection should  be under this elected district Govt.
As there are many gov agencies which keep a check on it.
But still there dhould be a government report publicily available about the product on a single platform and all the consumer rights and power of consumer to.exercise them in consumer forum.
