1 I agree that you would set up e Procurement portal which would bring in transparency mostly to the interested parties. But for common people it is important to know where and how much have been procured and used.
1 DGSD: All standard chemicals,Spares & fittings like electrical,mechanical,instruments etc can be fixed as a rate contract which will give cost reduction as well as to improve the timely procurement like Just in time, or to avoid the stock out situation. Simplifies the procurement process, but improves the timely material need.
1 It will be more efficient if we can implement this process along with one of the process (I have already shared couple of times on blog but no luck) if some one responsible or reading my blog from concern person, I have already drafted an IDEA to implement along with DGS&D. Please let me know if I need to share my IDEA. I will prefer to share on private blog.
1 It should be made mandatory to stop production of Edison bulbs and LED lights to be brought under a system same as for Medicine Price Controller (NDP).
1 The role DGS&D becomes of prime importance so as to ensure transparent procurement as well as to ensure the quality of the procured goods. The organisation can develop a portal for the same and train its dedicated staff in the direction of using digital techniques for carrying out tasks. A code of standards must be prepared and adhering to it the required goods must be procured.
1 In all the cities and towns kindly arrrange to clear all garbages in night time from 10.00 pm to 6.00 am in the roads and streets, because in morning peak hours these vehicles creating lots of inconvenience to the bike riders and public, and also the dusts and smell coming out from these vehicles during office morning hours can't be explained Another way these also protects lot of night thefts and other problems

1 Before registering my views, I skimmed through the recent submissions which talked mostly about corruption and demonetization. But there is a more serious issue that defames our nation internationally. BEING BORN AS A GIRL CHILD IS A CURSE IN MOST INDIAN FAMILIES. There are lots of differences on how a family treats a girl vs. boy child. Right from birth she is denied equality in all aspects of life. She is denied the right to pursue her dream.

1 Respected Sir, We are for a cashless and digital India. Now almost all institutions accept payment through NEFT or e-payment after registration. However, there are still some core Government departments such as DOT, WPC (Wireless Planning Commission) etc. those insist on payment by DD (Demand Draft) only. This increases hassles at both senders end and receivers end due to logistical issues. It would really help if all Govt Departments are instructed to accept e-payment only. Regards.

1 money deposited in jan dhan accounts may be benami. To solve this problem i suggest that money so deposited on account of HD notes may be converted into 10 years fixed deposit in the name of the account holder. He/she may be allowed to withdraw the interest accrued quarterly or let it accumulate till maturity of fixed deposit. I think no account holder will have any reason to object.This shall take care of benami deposits and  poor account holders and their family members will be delighted

1 respected Sir, your step towards curbing illegal, black money &corruption etc by demonetization of high value curreny is laudable & bold & very timely. it is only a person of the stature of Narender Modi could take such bold & historic decision. may I as a common man suggest that the Govt may consider introducing currency of Rs.400/- & Rs.200/- in place of Rs.500/- to ease the liquidity in due course after the current artificial crisis created by certain vested intetest people gets over. regds

1 Sir I have some suggestions to curb the tension in money exchange. I would like to suggest there should be a fund created for use of education, Health,drinking water, publictoilets, housing for poor, old age pension and sanitation facility for public use.  govt can announce that deposit into this fund is acceptable with 500/1000 notes this will facilitate 80G IT Act  as donation / contribution for the public welfare. 25% of amount deposited into fund eligible for income deduction.views enclosed.
1 1.  Make it mandatory for builders to provide temp/mobile toilets to constn workers. In the absence of it they defecate in open space.

1 Sir I wanted to give suggestion on INDIAN RAILWAYS TICKET BOOKING SERVICE.As a idea came into my mind that selling ticket of general as well as of reservation should be done with linking with number present on the aadhar card .by placing bar code reader on the bar code of aadhar card all the information will be on the desktop and the information of selled ticket will go to registered number of aadhar card.It would benefits as:- 1-Regular updatation of aadhar will be done@Manytrees will be saved

1 Sir, Lead by example and provision for cashless transactions at all govt counters. I have to draw cash from ATM and than book train ticket from counter. Instead, i should be allowed to book tickets using card at ticket counter. Similar things can be implemented at paying electricity bills, bus tickets, municipal taxes, parks etc. Cash management will be lesser reducing chances of black money and would increase govt revenue.

1 Sir, Please make government officials responsible for infrastructure projects more accountable. For all the roads that are laid - within 6 months craters start developing. This is the tax payer's money at work. Why shouldn't the government officials be made accountable for such poor quality roads? Why should contractors not be deducted of their fees if they cant provide a minimum of 2 year's warranty/ guarantee on the roads that they lay? Please have a comprehensive policy for this. Regards
1 Respected PM Sir I appreciate your sincere efforts in all fields to make our country best in the world.

1 Dear PM Sir, You had started a very worthy scheme: Startup India, Standup India. Sir, if practically viewed it seems for just the reserved sector of India. What's the value of scheme then? If a poor individual belongs to General category, has a great business initiative, but can't apply to get any benefits under the scheme because the government only allows reserved category applicants as the eligible candidate for the scheme. Sir, is this really justice and can this benefit all equally?

1 The NPS scheme being run by the government can become more efficient and the volumes may increase tremendously if the return on annuity (which presently is meagre 4-5%) after maturity is linked with government bonds and the interest income is made tax free. There should be a rider of only one annuity linked with one PRAN and only NPS corpus to be invested in order to check misuse. This will ensure sustained funding to the government and social security to the retirees.

We created a society where ethics, morals, values etc. Have become cowards words!! In Gujarati, there is saying Jar (money), Jamin (land), and joru (unchaste) are root cause of all fights. If you look at our current system, we are exactly moving towards disaster. With this background, the solution lies in the same. 1. Levy tax on every inch of land.

1 Sir,the basic issue is leakage of govt investment. On average 30 to 80 percent of govt expenditures get converted to black money or losses every year and this is the reason why we are still a developing county. Its is well known fact that current govt procurement system or tender system is the major source of revenue leakage. Now the time has come when we have to re set the smart mechanism, my suggestion is to set national accounting protocol for such player involved in this. 1/1
1 If government is serious on getting the maximum output and finish projects in time the only way that the projects should have fund allocated before start of project. The vendor or contractor is paid on time bound basis of bills of contractor and marking the lowest a contractor can go. The next step should be in case of dispute which is normally payment related to be resolved time bound (one month). Tender conditions cannot be one sided or again st the law. you can projects before time.
1 Sir, is it nice for a PM to allow a pvt Company to use his name for a new brand like jio in the name of digital India? Please don't allow any one to point out it. Thanks

1 Impact fees should be used on need basis for the community.
1 News of devaluation of our currency.     Its not at all in our countries interest  to let our rupee devalue mainly because we are net importers and large borrowers in the World and invariably input cost of our porducts as many inputs are imported and thus will affect our exports. The correct way to check imports and increase exports is incentives, duties and taxations.
1 1) Lot of money is being spent on essential commodities to distribute to the people. Only 10% is reaching the needy. To day many people are    living without work.  They are not willing to work in Agriculture, Industry, Service sectors.  Because they can survive with subsidised, without working.  As a result farmers are not getting workers also industries. 2) Most imbalanced remuneration system. Govt. employees getting abnormal salaries, for the same work very very poor pay in private sector.
1 allow black money to come back in the country as tax free and without any punishment(for a limited period) if they invest the money in key and required infrastructure sector. in return investor will remain the owner and the profits will belongs to him. this will be motivation factor  and helps in bringing black mpney in the country.
1 Sir, my view is that first of all we choose the suitable persons for suitable work.  then only any task can be get achieved.  Even in government sectors also there are so many employees with best and good skilled.  we can utilise their services more for the development of country.  If you can provide an opportunity for them they give best results.
1 It is true that there is going to be substantial value enhancement whenever government spends money and the roads and infrastructure there gets even doubled or tripled because of that. However, it may be difficult for govt to redeem as they simply say "Did I ask for this?", "Where is the appreciation realized by me?" etc. There is a very easy solution for this. Government can INCREASE the property value and on sale, the STAMP DUTY solvages revenue for govt and share by State and Center.
1 My View is totally different, Last many years we have seen that private sector has contributed big way in education sectors in India, Similarly government must come with plan each and every sectors with private and public participation. you cannot ignore private development in India. We need similar way plan and program where government agencies shall be working with private investors similar way like education sector Education sector is excellent examples for government to follow ready carefuly
1 any project start government first decide time limit and complete on time limit the gov decide the project and launch than few year has stop all think no one can look the matter and work is as well as gov pending .
1 Although it is relevent here but Govt. must look into the problems of MSME Sector and in fact PMO should start discussions on this topic also.  Apart from financial problems, MSME Sector faces is the place to work.  Small manufacturers spends whole life working on rental places.  Govt. must start discussion on this topic
1 We should have standard procurement and service contract conditions to be used at all levels of the central, state and local municipalities with expected measurable quality norms. The quality certification of the construction work must be done by independent party like DNV, KPMG, BV and thereafter only payment should be released to the contractors and suppliers.
1 Its very  very nicely
1 A reverse auction process may be considered where bids are placed through secure web systems.  All vendors can see rates quoted without disclosing identity of the bidder.  This is one way to ensure transparency of the procurement process.  Needless to say, very strong vendor prequalification norms must be in place and unambiguous work specifications to disallow any price escalations later
1 A Consumer Channel can be launch to upload pictures and videos of problems which consumer facing with product producers then Indian public can get best products
1 Encouraging make in India is very good initiative and thought.Gradually we should avoid dependency on China import.China cannot accept less business with India. Chinease economy cannot bear less business with India and than he will compromise on every front.Purchase policy should be transparent and open tender system is good.It should be monitored by two governing body separately to further avoid controversies.Quality and CAG audit should be given priority before procurement.
1 Sir,  is it nice for a PM to allow a pvt Company to use his name for a new brand like jio in the name of digital India?  Please don't allow any one to point out it. Thanks
1 1. Quality for any item is important; So, the BIS certification is a must for every govt. purchase and it is to be done at no cost. i,e, getting BIS certification should not be  a cost component. This will encourage every one to get certification from BIS. 2. Review of BIS standards to be frequent in line with international standards and our testing labs to have adequate facility 3. Tax rebate can be considered for those who provide quality products

1 All govt purchases of equipment should be with comprehensive insurance and spares for min 5 years extendable to ten with AMC. This can eliminate low quality goods for govt use. Expected life of the equipment along with spares should be decided before tendering . it can also eliminate L1 basis quality and service problems at present in govt tendering. Reward should be granted in terms of exemptions in income tax if the service provided is good and should be on large grouped purchases of govt
1 1- the employees/officers/ firm /contractor involve in purchase, should declare his  and family earning annual, and some vigilance should counter check it. 2- the definition of black money should be change , it should be depend on source and nature of income, not on amount tax paid. 3- Specification should be elaborate , detail with make and model, quantity  should be made by, competent person. 4-   warranty or guaranty should be clearly specified. 5- AMC should be periodically examine.
1 Govt has established new Aiims in raipur bhopal etc..they are recruiting superspecialist doctors..no facilities for using their service..lack of hospital infrastucture..lack of instruments.. no good quality residential place...why they should join..wastage of the time n talents..govt should take rapid action to provide adequate working environment with infrastructure n all kind of support...stop estalishing more new aiims rather consolidate existing seven aiims..
1 The procurement to our country is needed with people of India involvement.Policy  will be drafted separate for metro city,tier-I city and tier-2 cite and District headquarters.But the rules will be nationalized.The quality,Quantity will be one nation mode.We cant average all things on certain period of time.If the local people involvement is there then the security problem will not be more complex.The draft needed more focus on the end producers increasing margin mode.Thanks you.

I seek an appointment to showcase the same.
1 In Government sector Purchase normally done from DGS&d. On computer, laptop etc having huge loop hole as All items are 2years downgraded & when they supply to govt gets much more older & offered rates are high as on present day. Thus Govt using a down grade technology items at very high cost, as supplier till it supply to govt actual cost of product gets very low so make delay too for Getting more & more profit.Something a fast procurement process should be made to save huge pilferage
1 Buy Indian goods should be motto. This will compliment Make in India goals. Include a clause in the manuals that says "every effort should be made to procure India made products prior to going global".
1 There should be a centralized department for purchase & procurement for all central government departments. This would ensure that the entire ounce to purchase the best product at the most competitive price would be limited to one department only. This would lead to greater accountability and a single shop for control. General and fast consumed products could be purchased in bulk, leading to better price quote.
1 Any procurement in the government should be made compulsorily through online e- procurement system to maintain transparency and quality of goods supplied as per specifications . all government servant shall be given training on e-procurement process  through NIFM Faridabad
1 It would be nice to work out joint development projects where industry gets a chance to develop products for Defence and railways.  However, basic expertise project management skills is very much required at Railways and Defence to create this type of ecosystem.
1 It is very important to have ideal policy of purchases of goods..etc for departments, Generally tender issued for purchases of goods, it is ideal policy, but each and every purchases, to issue tender will be time consuming and costly,expensive, and cost effective due to wasting of time,there should be procedure to fix the standard rate with quality, procurement time, and cost etc. should be considered while determining the policies of purchases of goods or services in large public interest,thank
1 No doubt E-Registration and E-Tendering is the best way to procure the Goods.  But most important is the E Registration should have minimum requirements of TIN No.  Just like CIBIL Score is required for Financial Status of a Person, some sort of Quality Grading should be provided to the manufacturers.  One more important point is to give preference to MSME units.
1 Top to bottom, Farm to Blue Tech, small tools, equipment should be  manufactured and readily available to the everyday users. So, gradually changing the traditional  human sources into a skilled   potential generation. Eg, this is an era of DIGITAL and automated farming tools,that can change society, and then the nation. Science and Tech depart should monitor this matter of innovation. This refinement manufacturing sector and increase employment. New or modified tools for all levels of citizens.

1 To: Sir PM Modiji, This is my sincere request to consider my thoughts on Public Transportation facility within our smart Cities.I would suggest that it should be Completely Free for all people staying in those cities. All expenses of public transport should be managed by applying PT Tax to all corporate companies as well as all commercial establishments(restaurants/malls/small scale industries/shops etc.) based on each employee working with them. Please think over this suggestion.

As their is no provision to keep garbage, used plates, water bottle etc.. passengers used to throw id outside. It should be duty of canteen or the delivery boy to collect all garbage. Each coach should have atleast one dustbin so that passengers wont litter anymore.

1 Respected Sir Here I focus some points regarding calculation of taxes on various groups in our country. I assume that lots of Doctors are doing private practise in their clinic they are taking their fees in cash amount by every patient and very few are giving printed receipt of their fees . So how Income tax dep. Valuate actual Income of a Doctor of per day because there is no evidence how many patient they have seen in a day and how much charge to a patient.pls compulsary printed bill.
1 i think government should encourage and support sports other than cricket!.recently our ice hockey team were begging for the funds.and when our kabaddi team came to india after winning world cup,no one was there to welcome them.they had to go to their homes in auto.each and every sport is important.not only cricket :)..! plz it is my humble request to the govt.to please support other games.
1 Some of the Problems with Sports in India: 1.	Involvement of BAD politics in sports has spoiled the spirit. 2.	Influence of money to favour the rich and influential is responsible for bringing the morale down. 3.	Budget constraint in sports, with an exception of cricket, is responsible for lack of proper training/facilities/medical care etc.
1 Phys.Ed.to be integral part of school curriculum. Each child encouraged to love and play a sport. Playgrounds made mandatory in all schools. Sports scholarships in colleges to motivate youngsters. Underprivileged sports persons to receive economic aid. Sports infrastructure to be bettered. Sports academies set up and supervised by retired sportsmen. Exposure to international sports to be arranged. Politics to be rooted out from sports and officials who use sports for personal gain, punished.
1 The kids should be identified between the age of 7-12 years by way of a scientific assessment through battery of tests and thereafter groomed in Junior Sports Academies with pro active sports sciences support. Parents should be sensitized to the need of such an approach and they should be kept in the loop while winners are produced.
1 Clean up all sports Associations. It is must. Now all of the filled with cronies and corrupt people who care little for the sports. Age, term limits, open number-ship for all citizens, yearly elections in online mode, CAG auditing all sporting Associations accounts are must. Also bring them under RTI. Selection in team sports shall be done a an individual and not a coach.
1 We are stand with major population country so we have opportunity to find many sports person then we are starting find of sport person from ground level. (School, Colages etc.) and we have improve use high technology for make selection process fast and accurate.
1 Huge invest should be made in the sports area as that in case of defence.
1 6. In rural areas / tribal areas sports related to their custom / resources should b encouraged. 7. Periodic events to b held and winners to b given schlorships to make career in sports. 8. Talent search to b done in every village / school. 9. Equipments to b made available to sportsman. 10. online data of all competition to b kept for central monitoring and evaluation. 11. Ex sports persons to visit villages to encourage and spot hidden talents in the soil.
1 Ok for sports what we mostly want is to make awaremess and facilities.which can be possible through the govt investment because in countries like ours common public dont have enough money they can spend on the sports equipments .so govt.has to make investment and facilities of sports everywhere to easily available. And ofcourse inter level contest and priceses to be encouraged.
1 Success of any things depends on strong system. Developing sports from schools.schools should have facilities and team and promote sports. Interschool competition should have preference, good talent to be addressed with separate statewide sports board. Their performance monitored, recorded. Regular training from their to be taken care by the sports authority of India. Interstate competition every year to be conducted. There on select the national team and training them on international standards

1 Bring professionals of same sport event as Karta/Dharta without any political interference.Even with present infrastructure the results will improve.
1 Conduct an IPL style league where 5-10 events constitute a match and the ratio of indian players has to be 3 per five players. where for eg. there are are five events 2 players need to be international players two domestic stars and one local player. The winners are to be determined by the number of events won. The players just like IPL have to be auctioned. This would also rope in international coaches and would elevate the standard of facilities as well as the players.
1 All children up to age 14 should get three meals a day from the school or skill development center they attend which should have sports grounds and facilities. Evening snacks may be served before and dinner after sports.  Those identified may be sent for special fully funded camps in their favorite game or sport. These camps may send promising boys and girls to regional/district/state/national level camps.Go by the list of Olympic and Asian games for talent search and intensive advanced training
1 Main steps to make India a superpower should include setting up Sports Schools in all States where the core programs should be related to various sports apart from a general education program commencing at the age of 6 and extending to tertiary level, thereby making sports as a full time profession! The general education program should enable graduates to find employment in other fields too! The government funding of such sports institutions should be more than the normal ones!
1 Introduce a central rating systems for all sports - school to international- and have the website open to all. Every time one participates, the ranking changes. This should be the only mechanism for selections to any team. Experts in each sport should define the rating system, Central govt should manage the rating and portal. This way person in remotest part will be visible and selections will be on pure merit.

1 #Surajya In the medical sector we need stricter medical laws which will hold Doctors or medical personnel responsible for any failure in treatment of the patient and in case of the death of the patient the entire money spend on the treatment of the patient would be refunded back to the patient party.

1 Government must help the citizens to report any crime, illegal activities, corruption related issues through a separate portal.This will help a lot to minimise the impact.Now there is no such feature.Citizens are not aware about complaining to the concerned higher officials directly by mail. An acknowledgement mail must be sent to the sender and  action has to be taken by the officials sincerely. Then only India will become a power nation and grow.
1 Pls do us permanent.we are working in ratriya bal swathya program on contract from last 8 years.we give nation Healthy children's.supreme COURT also gives disicion,do not  put on contract to employees over 240 day.so pls give us justice on the occasion of good governance.thank you

1 #surajya i came to know and observed The that there are many universities (like mriu in faridabad) which dont return  security money of their students which are refundable and there are no any govt. Body where one can complain. After 60 yrs of independence these universities are exploiting their students please do something. Even i also suffered as same is happening in manav rachna univ faridabad. I passed in 2014 (b.tech) but college is not refunding our security money.when asked no response.
1 Swaraj with accountability, responsibility & vision for the future leads to #Surajya. The Jan Dhan Yojana has been a game changer along with Aadhar to improve financial inclusivity, accountability of subsidy disbursal & responsive citizenry. In the recent Chennai floods, the JDY account & Aadhar were immensely useful to many to establish identity & receive assistance. Pan India integration of the two schemes will lead to better resource mobilisation & utilisation.
1 Quality public service delivery(PDS,Education, and Medical),time-bound delivery in service matters,salaries, budgets,court-cases etc. Lot of technology to ensure transparent disposals,going e-governance ways. Access to hardware, and availability of networks for accessing internet. #Surajya #GoodGovernanceDay #MyGov
1 In my opinion, our country should be beggar free. Please ban all types of begging and rehabilitate these people.  And as far as my understanding,  a big mafia is behind this.According to me,  if a country has beggars means it's the failure of the govt system where it is unable to take care of all types of citizens.  And also there are cases of forcing people to begging.  So a formal ban should be posed and make these people rehabilitated and make them also part and accountable to the system.
1 #Surajya energise community formation through Roti (sanjha chullah backed by clean energy) , pani (common clean water filtration plant)  and swachhata (community controlled public toilets) at village /town and city level.. inter community dependence for learning and growing should be encouraged..
1 #Surajya Make Helmets and seat belts/airbags mandatory. No relaxation on the basis of religion. Campaigns like #NohelmetNoInsurance can be launched and police should be asked to issue spot challans without fail. Same for Number plates.. Press vehicles to be registered by media house so that arm wrestling by people having PRESS sticker pasted on their vehicles stop. Ambulances with patients should have more priority than MP/MLA/CM/PM cavalcade and that too withut negligence
1 all infrastructures be standardized. in USA all sidewalks all over country are of same standard. also every be digitalized to eliminate corruption.
1 what about the public servants who are so casual in their work? The suggestions; 1) fix a time limit and watchdog over them, if they do not complete on time, after 2 warnings, fire them & ensure they don't get any govt & private job. (Reason: attitude is that who will ask them if they don't do it). 2)The job must be PERFECT,Eg;they are just laying roads & underground drainage for the sake, but after one month pit and holes, ensure the contractor and the senior authority are punished #surajaya
1 Prisons should not become the breeding ground of crimes. It is neither a meeting place of criminals.Prisons should be like a school,where the criminals learn a language, learn an vocation, develop hobbies , have libraries and televisions that show moral based programs. When they come out they should receive adequate financial or material help to start a new life. their family should be kept in touch with the prison incharge. The money earned by them should be sent to their families.
1 for a clean india..what I feel that we want public toilets more in number....even in the roadside of the national highway..again we need more dustbins in each colony...and the administrative officers must visit to the each colony and tell them  about the cleanliness. .
1 1. National Prison Reforms - 5 year plans - More space badly required, basic facilities, capable doctors, recreational jobs 2. Proper classification of prisons,and prisoners (intensity of crime, sex) 3. CSR funds - special benefits who invest in prisons 4. Prisoners who have knowledge of vocations - carpenters- be employed in workshops. Plant nurseries, furniture shops,etc. be set up and income from sales be distributed amongst prisoners Regards, Rajkaran Singh Bhatti 9780005656
1 prison can be a best place to find tailent from india if someone is commiting any crime it means he has some tailent ; our govt should sharp his tailent and should  use for our country.
1 1. Training and welfare schemes for women inmates: Many are jailed for their Crimes but Punishment is Given to them so that they can be a Nice Human being. In Jail, Classes should be Given to inmates,'How to live Life Peacefully'
1 Councillors can also be there to help some of the prisoners who are doing crimes due to lack of their mental stability
1 Efforts to be made to reform- 1. Proper health and hygiene 2. Vocational training 3.Encouraging education 4.Separate prisons for serious offences and for minor 5.Awareness for ethical and moral values 6. Inspiring books for development of their mindset 7. Speedness in trial for the undertrial prisoner 8. Quality of food 9.Introducing new techniques of management 10. Eradicating corruption 11. Empowering female prisoners
1 need to change wrong practice involved , primary investigation report to  be submitted compulsory at the time of enrolment / registration   on event basis
1 Prison with hygienic speciality for prisoners rest room
1 Sir drug abuse is ramphant in prisons and prisoners use an y means to get them.Prison officers need to be more vigilant.drug free prison programmes can be implemented to end this practise.
1 Liberty of citizens depends on whims of people manning the judiciary. Decision depends on person seeking bail. In 2G scam SC gave bail to politicians saying “the charge sheet is already filed. Therefore, their presence in the custody may not be necessary for further investigation.” But this rule did not apply for Asaram Bapu, Jodhpur HC said, “The first bail application of the petitioner was rejected by this Court on merits. The filing of the charge-sheet is not a change in the circumstances.”
1 Point 1: We must strictly monitor the inflow and outflow of money of media channels including Doordarshan. Point 2: We must impose regular financial audits and must have a guidelines on company's suspense accounts for media channels. Point 3: We need huge money to strengthen the Indian army. For this, we must focus on the e-commerce sector of India and promote e-marketing and advertisements professional business in India. I can assume through this India can achieve a growth rate of 17% to 18%.
1 Stay at jail should be responsible to the prisoners. Prisoners should not be in the belief that life jail is happeir. Jail life  should be difficult so that there would be less crimes and prisoners should be worrying how to lead a difficult  life at jail. Hard work should be given to the prisoners. If life is easy at prisons ten the crime rste will increase. Going to prison should be deterrent so that there would be drastic reduction in the crime rate.
1 Dear Sir! Sometimes on argument or daily request on compliant we cannot feel safe & secure that what happens from which side and what the sitting judge or any public servant or any police officer may give what response or order or what behavior he returned to us. Q1. Is video recording inside in open court of law can be recorded by the advocates or the public for better hearing aspects in future and also for creating right evidence that this thing happens in actual and may be used in higher ap
1 " The degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons"
1 One reason is frustration with students. Only merit should be promoted in professional institutions. My one question to those who support reservation of any kind than merit in professional institutions " Whether they are willing to be reserved for the services of those very people" . In case not then 'Why are they supporting it " and then "to whom they will serve ; only the poor citizens" . At least allow the poor citizens to be served by competent professionals
1 Agriculture and agriculture related activities are the only activities that can be sustainable and economically viable for the prisoners reforms and automatically for the prisons reform in return. I can share my experiences in this regard. I am a farmer and environmentalist and have been practicing sustainable farming and sustainable living and can help the prisoners with skills of self reliance.for eg.making soap and natural detergent from soapnut tree fruits.making natural body wash etc.priya
1 How Buddha made the Notorious 'Angulimala' into a gentle monk, please make prisoners understand the futility of 'deceit, violence and Killing for living ' mindset and how the peace and helpful, diligent, kind, hard work and Buddhist treasures of spirituality will bring in harmony, happiness and transforms society into better place to live.
1 life.after sudarsana kriya yoga was introduced in trivandrum central jail,the general reaction of the prisoners was ..had we got this knowledge before we wouldnt have reached here..(as reported in newspapers) .That means any attempt to reform them really works. As per the second category there should be an advocates forum to visit the jails to take up the case of innocent victims.Gross human rights violation is another problem. This can be solved by periodic visits of human rights commission
1 Q: What is the purpose of prison? A: To punish an offender. If a prison fails to punish an offender it failed to meet its purpose of existence. Another question is - Is prison a secondary form of rehabilitation center? Answer: No! A prison is a prison. A rehabilitation center is different, let's keep the two separate. Don't try to convert a prison into a rehab center, because by doing that you will be diluting its effectiveness as a prison. [Continued in the next post...]
1 INSTEAD OF FOODING TO ALL PRISONERS GOVT. SHOULD TAKE HARD WORK  FROM THEM AS PER THEIR KNOWLEDGE UNDER STRICT SUPERVISION.. SPECIALLY FROM TERRORIST  TAKE HARD WORK LIKE DIGGING WORK
1 prison can't be reformed but take all the money which they have eaten in the custody , by making a jail factory where different hand made product will be produced and they will not be given money only standard of food will improve  instead of wages
1 his/her life becomes miserable once they come out as the society does not accepts them as before.This taboo has to be removed from the society .Government should allot big budgets fro jails now and privatise them by PPP.as its an industry too.Jails should be run like call centres.There should be some value of life for such people as they are human beings.Going in jail once should change the mind of person and a good experience rather than a nightmare.NGOS Should work inside jails.
1 continued..... They must be assigned to do some social work and hence they also help in the nation's building. They must also do some work which suits their talents and skills so that they come to know about the importance of job and hard work. NaMo is Only hope for a better India. NaMo rocks!!!.

1 Point 7: Implement the gateway of FICCI for all the export and import business in India. It should be just like the Bank gateway while making online payments. The exporters and the major importers are allotted with PIN number which is to be given online for each and every export business. This is to be authenticated by FICCI, so that each and every transaction will be strictly monitored for a more stream lined Balance of Payment account in India.
1 This is a good step towards Govt's Working Transparancy Policy vis a vis actual execution practice on ground, so as to link Policy Makers with whom & for whom the Policy is made.
1 This is the great Idea. This will give transperency to everyone.
1 This is a good initiative. I support for this. Open data should be available to bring innovation to solve our problems. I would like to bring proper computer education for school children and also the government should start using FOSS applications and linux systems in order to cut down the cost of computing needs.
0 I am Suggala Srinivasa Rao, S/o Late Narasimhaiah, R/o H.No. 6-2-96/C, Advocates Colony, Mahabubabad, Warangal District, Telangana State. I have sent my suggestions to your office at Central Government Secretriate and Your Residence Camp Office, Racecourse Road on 04-07-2016 by Professional Courier Service.  Please read my suggestions and reply to me sir.
1 Respected Sir/Madam, Its OK to share data that's relevant on any forum until and unless it doesn't hamper the safety and security of me or any of the related people, that includes , financial security and identity risks too...Additionally , If there has to be an online identification system , It has to be two ways.For example -If a person is looking up for my details , there should be a valid reason and I should be the approver of who can actually access that data, except government authorities.
1 Uniform Civil code would allow every citizen of the country to be treated equally. The uniformity of the civil code should enforce same law irrespective of caste, creed, religion or sex. 1. Marriage, Divorce, Inheritance laws should be applicable equally. 2. Women and Men should be treated same from crimes involving Domestic violence, Dowry harassment etc., 3. Custody of child in case of a divorce should not predominantly be in favor of mother.
1 Poor people needs immediate benefits.
1 data.gov.in is not accessible. It is down at this momemt.
1 Indian government has huge data of each and every department and dumping in files and our public is not aware  about it.Open Data portal  is very good step taking by Indian government.but govt. has to make sure the data will not miss use .I congratulation to Indian govt. by this step in our system will transparent,equality ,sharing of knowledge,and most important think public will understand  about the govt.work.
1 clause #4.d. NO WARRANTY. This is contradictory, public seek authentic and useful information for various purposes, but then if the people who are publishing data have this clause then the errors will be huge either intentional or unintentional. This will mislead as it is wrong info. So who ever is publishing the data must give the authenticity of such information else it will be considered as "Google Info", where anyone can publish anything and will fully default.
1 The present system of pensions to all Members of parliament who completes a term of 5/6 years is not justified..due to the present political system in India this is going to create a huge burden to the exchequer and above all it can be extended to the very few poor members if any..pl think about it..In my view,even 5% of the retired M.Ps doesnt require pension atall.
1 It's a very brilliant idea which can also protects us from any corruption or scan if and only if the system becomes transparent totally. Each and every transaction is shown with proper accuracy. These governments sites should be secure because the data is important and if list so it will be a disaster.#Opendatalicence #mygov #KUVER
1 4)There should be strict call centers for Municipal Corporation/Electricity/Flood/Telephone services/Hospitals. 5)No govt employee can use govt vehicles, they should use their own vehicles for traveling and offices. 6)No red/blue light cars should be there except emergency vehicles. 7)Government Friendly environment must be there, as police behavior is now like they are everything in this earth, politicians behaviour like they are bigger than god.
1 I think the speed of internet is absolutely disgusting. 3G 4G are for name sake only. There are number of countries who give internet speed of 28 Mbps. It is my humble request to government to work on it. If we get high speed internet everything will become easy. Secondly if we can get mobile range direct through satellite then then connectivity problem will be solved as in no.of villages we are unable to get mobile range.also in emergency situation we must be able to contact emergency nos
1 Sir, my idea/suggestion is where we can reduce the corruption from small town to nation, if we delete/redevelop a concept selection of corp orator for a city. If we see qualifications of the corp orators in Pune Municipal Corporation and Pimpri Municipal Corporation. I dont think they are eligible for a corporate post. At one side we are saying Uchchatar Shikhsa to Abhiyan for students(future citizens) for a national development. either govt can restrict politician as per education.
1 Transparency is needed to make people aware of what is happening and it will help to be in touch with new techniques..At the same time there should be some safety and methods to tackle incase if any problem arises..Since it is free of cost, datas should not go in wrong hands as it will pose problem to our Indian security..Definitely it's a good move by our government...Will support together for our nation growth..
1 I am an NRI. I have a view that all kind of Reservations in School , Colleges and institute should be abolish. A general candidate with 150+ marks can not get admission in institution like IIT where as candidate in reserve category gets admission with 50 marks. Is this fare for the future of the kids.Being an NRE we bring lots of foreign exchange to the country . If Govt. Want to Help the reserve people give them free schooling,books etc.but donot do un justice to the General category poors
1 #OpenDataLicenceIndia: To prevent corruption, each public investment done must have phone number, address, email of the contractor and government officer who got that executed. This should be open to all.
1 In free Bharath Education must change according to needs like Deshabakthi,Respect Mother,Father, & guru,methods, procedures, save Agriculture declare COW as National Animal to save Humanity,give employment,food products, Fertilizer with free pollution,save land for ever, people who are doing agriculture identify help,or give cows to them for more food healthy products for long live,to success with govt policy,check avoid adulteration,people who are doing find & punish immediately.Yogacharya
1 #Clause1: All the Open data should should have sections stating the direct implications of the current values to the common man in layman terms #Clause2: If precautionary measures need to be mentioned, so be it #MyGov
1 Good initiative, however "Open Data" might be misused. If there is a option to have a check on the misuse then its good else may cause security lapse.
1 This is an excellent initiative. Few points: Care should be taken that personal data and identifying information of citizens or other persons should not be made public. Proper stress be given to have the data updated at the highest frequency as possible. For e.g. if it is schedule of trains, it should be kept updated. Other wise the applications made on top of the data will get bad reviews even though no fault of the application creator. Also hope it is easy to use
1 #Clause5: May be QRCode as well for citing Attributions.
1 Respected Sir, As everyone know that our Medical system is very poor... Daily there is a deaths of many human beings due to wrong medicine prescribed by the doctor.. Even if you ask them the function of the medicine the just burst on you like they are super power and you are not authorized to ask what you are going to eat. In other Country Doctor has to do only diagnose of the patient and medicine is given by the Pharmacist. Please implement this in our country also for min risk.
1 great initiative to get track the thing on common man fingers, and there action and demand in discussion on fact and figures
1 Vivekananda elaborates – “Why was it so easy for the English to conquer India? It was because they are a nation, we are not. When one of our great men dies, we must sit for centuries to have another…” in contrast with other nations that had a greater number of educated men and women.(2/2)

1 India need to create leaders who will be like Statesmen cadre, with great patriots of the land, and do selfless service to the nation on par with the world standards protecting the sacredness, Vedic culture of the land. We may need about 10000 or more leaders now and in the future generations to make India a developed and powerful nation.

1 We have seen the influence of isis in asia and lone wolf attack method devised by this group in attacking crowd on days of national importance in congregational events.I have no doubt on security arrangements in my country but as a caution any vehicle should not be allowed in the vicinity of Rajpath.

1 Dear all The broadcasting of republic day parade to be mandatory through all the channels including private. This promotes the awareness, better understanding, the self respect as an Indian and vigor to the entire society. I observed during the republic day parade only few channels are broadcasting including state owned. At that time private channel are broadcasting rubbish things like serials , cinemas and local issues which are not of great value to individual or to the country.

1 They need to be provided with proper protective gears to deal with harsh weather conditions that they encounter in high altitude mountain regions and other tough terrains. They need to be provided with proper shelters, camps and bunkers that are built with high quality materials that provide necessary safety and protection. They should not be a soft target for enemies. We are proud of our armed forces and let us salute them for the sacrifices they make to keep the country safe and secure.
1 The person working in AICTE should be only those who have PHD degrees. AICTE needs to revamp the education degree programmes and sports must be inclusive for any degree. Practical subjects inclusion for all courses most necessary. Just theoretical wont help.
1 Requesting to bring all pvt. computer education centers societies under technical affiliation. huge amount of millions of Indian wasted due to private jobs. people can't apply in govt. service reason its not approved by any of govt. technical affiliation. yes they are giving good support socialy but financially institution owner will get millionaire. diploma holders has to suffer a lot. plz think about this. if this reform will come it will support for digital India... Jai Bharat.
1 AICTE should not approve the colleges who don't have any kind of facilities and proper staff, for monitoring this they should directly interact with students and continuously monitoring on projects and innovation then only we will get Good institutions......
1 PL CORRECT THE ADMISSION PROCEDURE OF JOSAA FOR IIT AND NIT ADMISSION. IIT DECLARED A LIST OF 26000 STUDENT WHILE A STUDENT RANKED 18000 COULD NOT GET ADMISSION IN IIT WHILE SEAT GOES VACANT IN THESE INSTITUTE ONLY BECAUSE STUDENT NOT GET SEAT WITHDRAW OPTION. SOLUTION FOR IT - DO SPOT ROUND ADMISSION FROM RANK LIST OF STUDENT WITH IN WEEK AFTER STUDENT SELECTED NOT AVAILABLE FOR REPORTING IN SELECTED INSTITUTION. DO FAST AS TIME IS LIMITED FOR THIS YEAR ADMISSION.
1 o, lets talk about the #AICTE. ok, many of tgeengineering colleges now approvel by the organization but came to the courses by the gov like uptu, mtu and by the others so many deemed universities. if we see the syllabus its too wide and every first yesr from the 4 years are very hard and I think in first year there shoul not be to burden as so many students comes from the up board and got difficulties to understand so most of the students in b.tech got the year back. which is very bad,plese...,
1 The AICTE should provide clear descriptions of essential skills and work habits supported by videos and tasks showing how these skills are used in everyday life and on-the-job so the students can develop their individual plans; the teachers can meet curriculum expectations and help students understand the value their essential skills and work habits; the employers can assess the performance of students in the workplace - their skills and work habits in hiring and training.
1 I am UGC NET qualified in Management but, i am not getting job as lectureship in IIM,government colleges or Institution approved by AICTE with UGC pays scale,AICTE has failed to protect faculty members and ensuring thier rights
1 All affliated universities and Aicte informing the college management before inspecting the college's.so they are planning how to correct their defects so with out inform to management inspect colleges many colleges doing fraud
1 Dear sir,, After reading a report I am pleased to see the contents, SWOT analysis of AICTE and all suggestions.. But proper implementation is very important.. The state government implement the AICTE initiated scheme their way,  Please see the attachments for details.. Hopes you will read it..
1 AICTE should make engineering syllabus more practical than theory. Projects should be made mandatory from 2'nd year onwards.
1 (13) NBA can recruit or appoint Faculty Members with M.Tech or M.E Degree who have worked at abroad in the field of Accreditation or Quality Assurance Documentation at HEIs. This will help very much in maintaining good quality in quality assurance and logistical analysis.
1 MHRD is requested to issue Government Resolution (GR) confirming that, any Open University (OU) should be empowered to operate as dual mode university to offer any academic programme in any mode of education (that is, Face-To-Face and/or Blended Mode)
1 (14) MHRD or AICTE or NBA can place advertisements in their websites to identify experienced people for taking up Quality Assurance Documentation, Accreditation and Rating of HEIs.
1 i am belong from u.p.my point,AICTE approved the college for higher education .but this time 900 appro..college in u.p. maximum institute take the admission of student on the basics of quantity not quality .AICTE take action for this type of institute so that we develop the our nation and reach the right place
1 In my point of view there should be made a new organization and name it like Indian Ministry of  Higher Education (IMHE) and give it all authority for higher education throughout the nation. There should be a clear definition and recognition of Formal Education(FE) and Non-Formal education(NFE) systems. All FE should conduct under "ABC" and same for NFE, there should be another body "XYZ" Both this "ABC" and "XYZ" should be of same authority and should work under above said 'IMHE'.
1 #TechnicalEducation #AICTE it should be mandated that all academicians should spend at least 2 years in the industry before they can be given the title of Professors. The current process requires industry knowledge to ensure Make in India is a success and future generations do not just come of universities with just book knowledge instead they are employable.
1 Low Quality Engineering College ko band krdo sirf yhi aasha h aapse
1 Part 7 10) The solution is, no institute must be allowed to set up until they have 100% Infrastructure and trained faculty and staff. 11) Faculty and staff in private colleges are underpaid and discriminated as compared to the faculty/staff in government colleges/universities. 12) There must be strict labour laws and proper remuneration and salaries must be paid as per norms.
1 Sir, Just went through report and like the suggestions and NEED for faculty development. I am working as a Astt Prof in Govt Engg college in Maharashtra from last 15 years and doing my job with full integrity. I am selected for PhD programme at IIT Roorkee under "AICTE QIP scheme". But our so called progressive state government denied me the deputation, and I am loosing my life time opportunity because of it. DO YOU REALLY THINK YOUR SUGGESTIONS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED?  ground reality is different
1 There should be enough funds for the students to work on live projects and experiment with their ideas. For this we don't need any formal change in the set up. If the Heads of the Institutes want to do this it can be done right within the exiting norms and there is enough autonomy for this but no one works for this.
1 AICTE hasnt performed duties to enable best technical education growth instead it has just focussed on providing approvals for engineering colleges based on normal standards. We have not yet adopted international standards. If we need to achieve greater heights we need to set standards for technical education at a lower double of countries like Germany, UK, USA to help students achieve great feats.
1 AICTE should be strengthened. I don't feel AICTE is a problem. The problem of low quality is because of inadequate schooling. I teach at an engineering college. I know the frustration of the students and teachers like us. We are curious. We want to learn but no one to guide or inspire confidence. Science popularizers are missing in this vast country. People like sam pitroda, prof yash pal are not celebrated enough. Modiji please restart a few programs like "turning point" again.
1 Some of the colleges not following Aicte rules in all aspects on student,faculty ratio and workload to faculty They are putting more burden on faculty .One college showing hiring faculty as their permanent faculty .
1 In technical education re lack a subject "Machine design" which tells how to make capital goods which serve the purpose of preparing other goods in a factory. We should learn in engineering how by applying knowledge of lathe machines, pulleys, keys, cotters, robotics, welding, casting dyeing, motors, crank shafts etc we can build machines which perform the job we want it to do. We have learnt about all these aspects separately but not how to collate this knowledge to build a machine.
1 Government shall provide relief to all working professionals by deducting the fees paid for Post Graduate study courses from `taxable income'. for courses which are approved by AICTE/UGC. This will provide encouragement for doing ME/M Tech.
1 Happy Deepavali to brave sons/daughters of mother India. You are the best, will be best and special for us. Pls do continue the task we all with you.

1 #MannKiBaat, #Sandesh2Soldiers Dear Modi ji, Why only a few are priviledged to serve our Nation? Please introduce a voluntary scheme whereby anyone before entering 'Job Market- private or Government' and specially so as a mandate for Government service has to serve Armed forces in 'disturbed regions' This will help build a Nation rather than just feeling sorry about the state of affairs. We all can be Indians when we 'see & feel' the pain Nation is going through rather than just hearing it
