Our countrymen living in smaller cities don't have option to see their national heritage. In this regard virtual museums are a great initiative. But this needs to be partnered with physical programs as well. Artifcats from high profile museums should g on tour of India, where they will be displayed for 15 days. Schools of the area needs to be encouraged to visit the museum in that time frame. Such initiative partnered with physical programs will increase the productivity much fold.

The best way to know a country's people is by knowing their culture and religious traditions,which is soulfully reflected in their life style,monuments,religious texts,festivals being followed.I think the best way to promote tourism is when our secrets of traditions ,rituals (bharatya sanskriti)which are secretly connected with our past ,is attached with the monuments,scriptures,idols,maps being displayed in the museums.People accept what they understand & then admire naturally.HARI OM

First of all i made hearty congratulations to the honorable prime minister for demonetizing currency. I should say something which necessary to consider in black money as well as Demonetization, banning of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 is a master stroke but re-introduction of new Currencies of Rs.500, Rs.1000 and Rs.2000 create lot of corruption on the upcoming years it will badly affect the economy within few years. So,completely block Currencies  above "Hundred".This reduce the black money prominently.

#StatueCleaning Few things to be noted here: 1. Statue should be covered on the top and on sides through see through walls since birds are the first and foremost that may spoil the statue. 2. A spinning wash tubes can be fit on the walls and it should be operated once every day so that the statue is washed automatically and cleaned. This has to be done during 2-3AM since it is during this time, the vehicle movement will be really less. 3. #MyGov can appoint volunteers for this process.

Also if any person want to stop them then these people should be given some helpline No. or police support so that before throwing they should think twice.

I request the Hon Minister to extend this to all real estate transactions irrespective of amount. 2. Credit mandatory for paying bills in five star hotels. I request the  Hon Fin. Minister to extend this to all payments in three star and above class hotels and clubs. Let me submit a few more suggestions to the Hon FM: 1. PAN card shall be linked to Aadhar Card.

If we stop using an item, which is artificially high priced, the prices will come down in no time. This is more so in case of perishable commodities. Unfortunately there is no concerted effort on part of the consumer and we just blame the government for not doing enough.
