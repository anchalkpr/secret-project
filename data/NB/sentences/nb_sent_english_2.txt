However, there are still some core Government departments such as DOT, WPC (Wireless Planning Commission) etc. those insist on payment by DD (Demand Draft) only. This increases hassles at both senders end and receivers end due to logistical issues. It would really help if all Govt Departments are instructed to accept e-payment only. Regards.

In my opinion it should be min of 20 years and max of 30 years.Criminals of  this specific case feel free and do whatever they want to do, moreover the know they will get release after 7 years and in some cases theytry to attempt murder of victim,because girls unki baat nahi sunti.Understand the plight of girls.Thank u

The NPS scheme being run by the government can become more efficient and the volumes may increase tremendously if the return on annuity (which presently is meagre 4-5%) after maturity is linked with government bonds and the interest income is made tax free. There should be a rider of only one annuity linked with one PRAN and only NPS corpus to be invested in order to check misuse. This will ensure sustained funding to the government and social security to the retirees.

Sir,the basic issue is leakage of govt investment. On average 30 to 80 percent of govt expenditures get converted to black money or losses every year and this is the reason why we are still a developing county. Its is well known fact that current govt procurement system or tender system is the major source of revenue leakage. Now the time has come when we have to re set the smart mechanism, my suggestion is to set national accounting protocol for such player involved in this. 1/1

Some of the Problems with Sports in India: 1.	Involvement of BAD politics in sports has spoiled the spirit. 2.	Influence of money to favour the rich and influential is responsible for bringing the morale down. 3.	Budget constraint in sports, with an exception of cricket, is responsible for lack of proper training/facilities/medical care etc.

I am an NRI. I have a view that all kind of Reservations in School , Colleges and institute should be abolish. A general candidate with 150+ marks can not get admission in institution like IIT where as candidate in reserve category gets admission with 50 marks. Is this fare for the future of the kids.Being an NRE we bring lots of foreign exchange to the country . If Govt. Want to Help the reserve people give them free schooling,books etc.but donot do un justice to the General category poors

This is an excellent initiative. Few points: Care should be taken that personal data and identifying information of citizens or other persons should not be made public. Proper stress be given to have the data updated at the highest frequency as possible. For e.g. if it is schedule of trains, it should be kept updated. Other wise the applications made on top of the data will get bad reviews even though no fault of the application creator. Also hope it is easy to use

Respected Sir, As everyone know that our Medical system is very poor... Daily there is a deaths of many human beings due to wrong medicine prescribed by the doctor.. Even if you ask them the function of the medicine the just burst on you like they are super power and you are not authorized to ask what you are going to eat. In other Country Doctor has to do only diagnose of the patient and medicine is given by the Pharmacist. Please implement this in our country also for min risk.

In my point of view there should be made a new organization and name it like Indian Ministry of  Higher Education (IMHE) and give it all authority for higher education throughout the nation. There should be a clear definition and recognition of Formal Education(FE) and Non-Formal education(NFE) systems. All FE should conduct under "ABC" and same for NFE, there should be another body "XYZ" Both this "ABC" and "XYZ" should be of same authority and should work under above said 'IMHE'.

AICTE hasnt performed duties to enable best technical education growth instead it has just focussed on providing approvals for engineering colleges based on normal standards. We have not yet adopted international standards.

In technical education re lack a subject "Machine design" which tells how to make capital goods which serve the purpose of preparing other goods in a factory. We should learn in engineering how by applying knowledge of lathe machines, pulleys, keys, cotters, robotics, welding, casting dyeing, motors, crank shafts etc we can build machines which perform the job we want it to do. We have learnt about all these aspects separately but not how to collate this knowledge to build a machine.
