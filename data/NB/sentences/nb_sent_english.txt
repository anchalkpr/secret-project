I feel that administrator should be appointed in every subdivision and district and state level who takes cares of assets of every dept and ensure its proper utilisation as per demand of every dept . These assets are of public and it should not be wasted in this way. For example if any vehicle is not us

Human trafficking has become very serious or incurable disease. My opinion is that Central Govt. in association with all State Govts should make a common website with all details of missing persons. A separate/independent agency rather than local police should investigate such cases coz these crimes are done by white collar criminals. Criminal history of such criminals should be disclosed on aforesaid website. Sharing data of missings at national level by all means would be first step. Jai Hind.

Narendraji, I have seen how labor is exploited by another senior labor(Incharge) in most of the construction industry. It is like supply of labor. Under your strong leadership people want to invest in India and develop it. As the aspirations of even the most illiterate and so called backward class have risen there is a rush to encash the growth through any means. My suggestion is let there be no growth unless it can be sustained. There must be strict vigil on compensatio paid to even teh labor.

Human beings are trafficked in various facets - maidservants, unskilled/skilled labour, prostitution, emigration, slavery etc.  Fake orphanages get foreign aid & keep so-called orphans who are used as slave labour. Traffickers lure women as maidservants & then betray them by forcing them into prostitution or sex-slaves. Rampant emigrant trafficking exists in which people migrate illegally due to better livelihood in European/American countries. ALL TYPES EXPLOITATIVE, WRONG & HAS TO BE STOPPED!

Following is my considered view on the subject of Simultaneous Elections to Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabhas: 1.Constitutional amendments to Articles 83, 172, 85 and 174 must be carried out to streamline   the process: 2. It is desirable to hold simultaneous elections as a result of which besides the reduced expenditure MPs and MLAs can concentrate on nation-building process and money saved on this method can be used for development work.

I think it is a sound idea to hold simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and State assemblies once every five years. These houses/assys should have a fixed tenure of five years. However, ways will have to be devised to check horses trading in assys of smaller size especially where the mandate is fractured or parties have near equal strength. Frequent efforts to topple govts by competitive political parties will become order of the day. A way out can be to ban defection altogether.

Yes, absolutely.

Dear Modiji, I have a simple suggestion that you open various kiosks at significant locations within the city to spread awareness and apt handling of such systems so that citizens would be able to understand their compatibility with them. Such systems were implemented by M.C.G.M in Mumbai to provide city, tourist, public transport info., navigation info. to visiting tourists as well as localites. Also we can implement such systems on trial basis in Ration shops, postal services etc.

Product processing or development or Value must be added at local level to increase earnings for basic producer. Villagers must create wealth in their villages by value addition to their produce at local levels.

Its a good initiative to have a solar park. But I would suggest one step ahead of this. Why can't there be "Health Park" and 'Solar Park' would be a sub-set of this. Municipal co-operation develops parks in the cities. In place of that think for a "Health Park", having track for morning walk on the outskirt of the garden. Think, if the garden is fenced with Solar and Wind plates. Suppose that in the morning and evening, chanting of ved mantra is continuing. In the mid of the garden there is Ayurvedic garden with plants such as 'Aloevera, Tulsi etc and on the track side there are fruit trees e.g. Mango, Guava, Pomegranate etc. and also trees whose wood can be sold e.g. Shisham, Jaamun, Sagwaan etc. While leaving the garden, People can purchase some items their only.  Also a fish pond in the centre of the park. Think, in the same garden cultural activity is being performed. Why we always think and govt. drains crore of rupees on a single task. Why we not think for an integrated approach! A day to day increase of crime is taking place because we are not socially bound together. We try to copy what we see on the TV while in a nearby flat or house, a great artist lives even then we approach TV or film celebrity. Dharm is a universally approach to keep us together but only few narrow minded persons divided us in Hindu or Muslims or in them sub-casts.

A centralized data bank containing DNA details of all children found needs to be maintained. Parents who lost their kids can undergo DNA testing and this also can be maintained in a depository.

This really is an excellent and very thoughtful initiative by the government, so I'd like to extend my thanks in appreciation. But I have just one suggestion for improvement and it is that the name of the initiative, 'Khoya Paya' or 'Lost and Found' does not seem to be the most optimal because we're speaking of children and not articles or things. The name should possess more of a humane aspect to it. I don't know if it's too late to be able to rename the initiative but it is my honest feedback.

If fees for IITs are comparatively quite lower, even IIMs should folllow similar fee structures. 2. Government should hire directly from IIMs through final placements, at least for summer internship. 3. MBA instead of PGDM 4. Why should there be caste based reservations in choosing one of the board of governors also? Thanks!

My name is A. Rajagopal. I am deeply disturbed by this bill. I am a graduate from IIM Ahmedabad 1977 batch. The current bill as it stands will kill everything that made IIMs ( and IITs) internationally renowned institutions.  Suggest this must be scrapped and a new bill with limited goal of financial transparency only without ANY operational interference by Govt. Please see attached for more detailed comments #IIM, # MyGOV #IIMBILL2015

Most Important is give responsibility to IIM to do work in interior area where basic need  not available , root of the whole development is village development. Please do involve to IIM to find solution how to solve problem on this root level problem. Our big percentage of labour and man power is living in village. SO make IIM bill 2015 as village development oriented.

IIMs should be in multiple locations but should have stringent filters to ensure quality like teaching and research...encourage collaboration with older IIMs...focus on FPM and number of PHD equivalents to build our doctoral pool....collaborate with industry to get Chair Professor and research sponsorship and course should bring out innovative work rather than academic excellence through rote learning or case study hard work alone. Ethics and career management to be included in courses.

Even you may implement reservation programs in NIMs if needed. Please let the IIMs run autonomously.

It is astonishing that Harvard Business Schools charges only about 1.3 times the US per capita GDP from its MBA students. While the course fees at India’s top IIMs is about 20 (twenty) times of India's per capita GDP. This needs an immediate correction for the benefits of citizens of this country, Availability of loans is no justification for charging such huge fees as the burden of paying the loan remains with the students and their families.

Bill  promises to meet a long-pending demand to convert diplomas awarded by the IIMs into degrees. But the real quest is whether gov control would help make these institutes centres of excellence. Public-funded institutes in India figure nowhere in the top 100 global ranking index. IIT have functioned in deciding their own curriculum, yet evidently the gov is seeking to interfere in their functioning. In case of the IIMs Bill, it is not clear to what extent gov seeks to interfere in functioning?

The NPS scheme being run by the government can become more efficient and the volumes may increase tremendously if the return on annuity (which presently is meagre 4-5%) after maturity is linked with government bonds and the interest income is made tax free. There should be a rider of only one annuity linked with one PRAN and only NPS corpus to be invested in order to check misuse.

On average 30 to 80 percent of govt expenditures get converted to black money or losses every year and this is the reason why we are still a developing county.

Now the time has come when we have to re set the smart mechanism, my suggestion is to set national accounting protocol for such player involved in this. 1/1

If government is serious on getting the maximum output and finish projects in time the only way that the projects should have fund allocated before start of project. The vendor or contractor is paid on time bound basis of bills of contractor and marking the lowest a contractor can go.

1) Lot of money is being spent on essential commodities to distribute to the people. Only 10% is reaching the needy. To day many people are    living without work.

It is true that there is going to be substantial value enhancement whenever government spends money and the roads and infrastructure there gets even doubled or tripled because of that. However, it may be difficult for govt to redeem as they simply say "Did I ask for this?", "Where is the appreciation realized by me?" etc. There is a very easy solution for this. Government can INCREASE the property value and on sale, the STAMP DUTY solvages revenue for govt and share by State and Center.

Suggestion: During the cleaning with high pressure, the water splashes on to the seats and people around including children. If they use any barricade that would stop the splashes. Problem in train: Maintenance:Switches are missing,the fans are dirty,some are not working.A/C coach Bed sheets, pillow covers are covered with papers, these are thrown down.Need Bins.

Government must help the citizens to report any crime, illegal activities, corruption related issues through a separate portal.This will help a lot to minimise the impact.Now there is no such feature.Citizens are not aware about complaining to the concerned higher officials directly by mail. An acknowledgement mail must be sent to the sender and  action has to be taken by the officials sincerely. Then only India will become a power nation and grow.

In my opinion, our country should be beggar free. Please ban all types of begging and rehabilitate these people.  And as far as my understanding,  a big mafia is behind this.According to me,  if a country has beggars means it's the failure of the govt system where it is unable to take care of all types of citizens.  And also there are cases of forcing people to begging.  So a formal ban should be posed and make these people rehabilitated and make them also part and accountable to the system.

what about the public servants who are so casual in their work? The suggestions; 1) fix a time limit and watchdog over them, if they do not complete on time, after 2 warnings, fire them & ensure they don't get any govt & private job. (Reason: attitude is that who will ask them if they don't do it). 2)The job must be PERFECT,Eg;they are just laying roads & underground drainage for the sake, but after one month pit and holes, ensure the contractor and the senior authority are punished #surajaya

Prisons should not become the breeding ground of crimes. It is neither a meeting place of criminals.Prisons should be like a school,where the criminals learn a language, learn an vocation, develop hobbies , have libraries and televisions that show moral based programs. When they come out they should receive adequate financial or material help to start a new life. their family should be kept in touch with the prison incharge. The money earned by them should be sent to their families.

Liberty of citizens depends on whims of people manning the judiciary. Decision depends on person seeking bail. In 2G scam SC gave bail to politicians saying “the charge sheet is already filed.

Stay at jail should be responsible to the prisoners. Prisoners should not be in the belief that life jail is happeir. Jail life  should be difficult so that there would be less crimes and prisoners should be worrying how to lead a difficult  life at jail. Hard work should be given to the prisoners. If life is easy at prisons ten the crime rste will increase. Going to prison should be deterrent so that there would be drastic reduction in the crime rate.

Q: What is the purpose of prison? A: To punish an offender. If a prison fails to punish an offender it failed to meet its purpose of existence.

Don't try to convert a prison into a rehab center, because by doing that you will be diluting its effectiveness as a prison. [Continued in the next post...]

As the coaching they provide is not a course. And the fees of such coaching institute is too high for a lower middle class man to pay. Please do something in this regard.

Recently a TV channel conducted a programme and asked youth why we are celebrating Republic day. Out of hundred only 2 given correct answer. I feel it is due to present education system which is concerned about the core subjects. It is required to insist on the Institutions to have at least one period a week to have General knowledge. This is leading to public not having respect to the system or Constitution. Immediate steps shall be taken to educate youth for taking system in curriculum.

11) Bicycles provide mobility for those who may not qualify or afford to drive. Not everyone can get a driver's license (or wants one), and the cost of purchasing, insuring and maintaining a car is out of reach for a lot of people. Almost everyone can afford some sort of bike. Other than walking, bicycles are the most cost-effective transportation on the planet. 12) Studies show that bicycle commuters are healthier, more productive, and require less time off at work.--- pls read next post

Dear PM Sir just throwing an idea to counter power transmission loss.Can we make a chip/storage card to store power from power plant.n depending upon the need of villages/panchayats/blocks where power supply is difficult,we distribute the chip to that place.This stored power later converted into electrical energy by some device in given place. It will be one of the innovation that can initiate wireless transmission in india and transmission loss will taken care and lots of money can be saved

Why is India still a developing country and what is stopping it from being a developed country? This particular question strikes me every time when I read something about India’s education system. I see India’s education system as a stumbling block towards its objectives of achieving inclusive growth.India is going to experience a paradox of nearly 90 million people joining the workforce but most of them will lack requiste skills and the mindset for productive employment.

Dear sir, In my opinion, we should emphasize on teaching basic science physics, chemistry, material science which is lacking and really can initiate AVISHKAR in our country.Technology and science should be segregated. Education institutes including engineering should be reviewed in respect of facilities such as Labs, Library, and faculty. Industries should be linked to universities and has to allocate fund to academic institutes. research should be decentralize to various institutes.

One main reason very large % young generation stuck in false legal cases without getting justice for years together. this is the main reason for drug abuse. Request to bring reforms in judicial system for timely justice, gender neutral laws. Pl abolish the system of proving innocence which  is against natural justice.

This is a very important topic for young and old.  I am an NRI, who loves India very much.  I have nothing bad to say, but every where I go, I stop people from doing wrong, stop the ill treating of cows, feed the poor, help in my own way to poor as much as I can.  But we need to educate public, by putting more ads to put a stop to unhealthy habits people already have for a long time period.  Drug addiction coaching in schools by govt officials, and on Radio/TV/Road signs in villages/cities.

1. Drug menace can be tackled only by strict action against the drug mafia. NCB,police and other enforcement authorities should be strengthened and be given enough functional autonomy to take action against the drug mafia. An awareness campaign should be undertaken across the nation and to all sections of society 2. Safety for women - steps to be taken 3. U turn by the govt: this must be addressed to clear the air 4. min gov max governance: this must be explained in the wake of cabinet expansion

Pl show your commitment to mitigate the drug usages by declaring TO MAKE A LAW that any politician found involved in drug trade will be banned for life to stand for election as the person who dared to play with the life of citizens can never the custodian of the rights of the citizens. This will go a long way to mitigate the usages of drugs

Sir, it is high time when we take some strong initiatives for women security. I feel this is one area which require immediate action. Cases like 'Cab driver raping a girl in delhi' not only create a sense of fear among all the girls but also question the identity of India in the world. Why aren't women feel safe; what steps should we take to improve this situation; should be implement stronger laws, policies & initiatives. Sir, please take some strong steps to stop crime against women.Please!

we must educate our youths and children about the harmful effects of this drugs, seperate chapters in the books should be dedicated for this, we can provide presentation in the form of slides or videos what happens if one take drugs. over the counter drug should be stopped by the retailer without the prescription of doctor, unauthorised seller should be caught. and people who are already drug dependent should be properly counselled and rehabilated

Two cures that i being the citizen of the worst hit state will like to share are 1.Efficient and honest will by the authorities and  strict implimentation of laws. 2.Stringent measures for cross border drug trade and giving strict punishment to those invilved not at lower but higher levels. 3.Yoga can be of great use in this as we will never have enough medicines and the medicines too are adictive. And yoga can help build the will power and health required for deaddiction

Respected PM. The "increase in usage" tht u talk bout is especially seen among the teenagers. #Like sex education, drug education needs 2 b mandatory in school. #Since its considered as a recreational activity, D Energy of the youth should b channelized into better recreational activities like Trekking, Adventure sports, Parks, etc n suitable facilities should b provided.#If caught, thr should b compulsory rehabilitation program. #Market rate of drugs shld b very high so police need to act.

Good afternoon; I watched the movie Traffic with Michael Douglas, which also deals with the same problem and the points are true. How to stop young people from consuming illegal drugs when they think it is "cool" and if not, it gets them high if they can't deal with their issues - school pressure/peer pressure / family trouble etc. Also I don't know how much drugs cost but if they are expensive, chances are they are consumed more for partying than depression? My gut would be to look at it....
