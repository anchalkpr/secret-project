14 0 Using Aadhaar number in elections will plug many illicit practices going on in the elction process. It can also let a citizen to vote from any polling booth he wants as his identity can be unmistakenably established. All the bank branches can serve as a polling booth. It will serve a lot of people working away from their hometown.
3 0 Dear sir, I want to make one point for which this may not be the right forum. please instruct your people to make it a bit simpler to search a forum or even to create a new forum if required. Coming to the point I want to make, Now that we have already spent crores of rupees in acquiring bio-metric details of people of our countries for giving them an unique identity number.(Intended to be used for plugging subsidy leakages). But the same can be used in elections.
12 0 Dear sir. One concern that salaried people face in our country is they pay heavy taxes as long as they are earning and once they retire govt does not provide any social security or pention and then they are left on their own. This is not the case in other countries who charge equal tax as in our country. Medium class people dont get any benefit like medical or school or housing from govt considering quality of services offered but are paying max taxes.
10 0 Respected sir. I think there should be some open forum/group where citizens can share views their general views and not any group/topic specific views. i would like imphasize need to bring in rich farmers in tax bracket. Where small farmers are dying because of income related concerns, rich farmers  are buying real estates and luxury cars by cash while enjoying all subsidies meant for poor farmers. This will not only help in growth of our country but will also put control on black money.
3 0 CSR programmes are self Designed by the Corporates.Govt should design the requirement and make the Corporates show their responsibility to the Public.Corporates can Maintain the Entire or Partial Requirement of the City or the Location arround them or anywhere in India.Solar Installation for their Full or Partial Power Requirements should be insisted.Statue Cleaning, Road Maintenence etc can be given to them depending on their CSR capability.

1 0 Dear PM as we can see the drought condition in Maharashtra, Maharashtra is not only place where this happens..there are so many places.. Agriculture is a serious issue.. we all have to look in to the matter... if our farmer will happy than only we can say yes y"Achchhe Din Aa Gye", because everyone's basic need is food, we can live without vehicle, internet, mobile phones, computer, ISRO's big project, Bullet trains and many more but can't live without food. So basically our problem is (pg1)
2 0 Here is a suggestion for Swaccha Bharat misssion, I am a resident of Mysore and I see that the roads that are layed in the city are of low quality as such but they are layed in such an unscientific way that a lot of dust is strewn around. Instead if the roads are layed completely upto to drains or footpath without any space for mud or dust, I believe India would automatically be devoid of dust and other particulate matter which is a major eyesore as well as harmful to the health of the citizens.
3 0 Hi Modi Sir, we need to make this earth green by planting more plants as possible. I request you think about identifying empty government lands and Plant as many trees. This can be linked to waiving of loans to farmers. Who wants their loan to be waived should take the additional responsibility of doing this. The lands will be still govt lands. Also with the help of corporate companies like Wipro,cts,hcl,tcs who say they give lion share of their profits for charity. yours sincerly Gopal
1 0 It is not possible to make clean India a great success without thinking about air pollution through various factories & viechels.The thermal power generation plant are also heavy source of pollution. so, Govement should advertise for Solar Power use and make suitable policies for common people,so people can get electricity through solar energy & use it for domestic & agriculture section.
1 0 Sukanya Samriddhi Account (SSA) rules are amended & No Publicity is made for more regressive rules. It is a messed up schemes where parents may not invest any money as withdrawals from the account for the purpose of education of daughter is also restricted with unwanted conditions! How do Government promote beti padhao with faulty schemes like SSA? Scheme was sold with maturity at 21 years (age) and actually turned out to be 21 years from the date of opening of the acct! 10+21=32 yrs of age.
2 0 Statues of national leaders should have shade on top .we should not allow them in hot sun,rain for years .The statue gets discoloured . A small write up of year of the leader ,contributions to the country on granite ,proper lighting in the night using solar and L.e.d bulbs ,garden,prevention of birds,animals  near the statue for cleanliness.installing maintenance free clocks to attract attention and cleanliness of the place.This should happen in all cities and towns.

1 0 These days we are finding that a lot of tension is generated by our neighboring country and in this respect I want that in all the schools a compulsory NCC training should be practiced because it will help our people to become more disciplined and also giving strength to our country as a whole.
1 0 This is a tragedy for India that after getting Independence from British rule we never concentrated for the nation building process. The Basic asset for any country is its people and and I think that right from childhood the basic structure of nation building block should be framed in the child mind and it should be regularly practiced without any religion or language divide.
1 0 Corruption is like a cancer to the Nation, terrorist attacks all because of corruption. We tasted the evil the maximum, Now new generation has to be trained as per Honesty, sincerity, love for nation. All the doctors who has given free seat based on the talent has to serve to villages.
3 0 Beloved PM First step to development of India: 1. corruption free 2. All Government officials has to work effective 8 hours per day. 3. Need not bring black money from abroad there is black money within India. 4. Only few people honestly file tax returns. for whom Income tax department harass there are 95% people not coming under taxation, department is least bothered to bring them into tax net. 5. House property 30% or actual deduction whichever is less deductible
0 0 My view is to decrease the crime rate in India.there are lot of scheme regulated to reduce crime.My idea is that a person should be bewared about crime from his childhood.it can be done by sanskar explained in Hindu culture. If a mother give her child proper nourishment and proper direction should be given by acadmics . if it is possible than we can stop crime to great extant.

0 0 Sir, VHSND Village Health Sanitation Nutrition Day is a important platform for rural India. We need your guidance to further strengthen and further improve the quality of services of the the VHSND across India.
1 1 Govt should bring Law where any media channel or a public figure is prohibited from using the name of community , cars , religion or society publicly . It know fac that the objective of accusing community , cast is to creat hatred and build exclusive boat bank by politicians and public figures . If Media is barred then politicians will find it difficult to reach to public .
2 0 I order to improve Justice system , create Ombudsman for civil matters . Make MPs and MLAS as Ombudsman in line with Panchayat system . We must ensure that Justice is delivered in max 30 days TAT. Is not too expensive to do but most important . This alone can solve Kashmir & NE problem and avoid situation like JAT agitations . People are frustrated today and therefore find excuse to vent anger. In addition also ficus on sports to change the mind of youth of the country . This  is real SURAJYA
1 1 The approach of the govt should be to relax the rules more and more and bring accountabilty of public through efficient Justice system . For this on priority increase number judges and courts , consumer courts so that Justice is delivered in 30 days max . Swatch Bharat is failed campaign because I cannot go to court if road in my society is not cleaned due to hassle .
0 1 This Year instead of cleaning statues, lets clean dry beds of river, lakes and dams and make them more deeper. Benefit: More water storage capacity, cleaner water, less cost of cleaning and above all in case of excess water it will save us from flooding and using the access water positively.
0 0 Honourable minister they don his duty well. welcome and respect them.good idea to removing their statue in centre of the street and roads.and rush areas.
0 0 Atleast from now onwards stop keeping the statue of leaders. more important things like 100% education to one and all, free treatment of health, employment ,skill development population control, pollution control, speed justice, more importance for agriculture,political representation according to their population,lessons against smoking, drinking, drugs, sucides, awareness on road rules, keeping plants, water harvesting pits all over the country, these are very important than statue cleaning.
1 0 In every college has one NSS unit by using them we can clean the near by bus stand or railway station
0 0 What a wonderful idea to respect our elders and leaders!!!. Most of the birds are using our leaders as toilet. None of the present political leaders have the courtesy to clean it, even though they are declaring holidays and using them for their vote bank etc. Look at the same leaders statues in other foreign countries, they are maintained very well. Only in India we never respect them after their death. If we remember our parents after death, we remember even our leaders. Thanks.
0 0 Lets stop wasteful expenses celebrating 100-150-200 Birthdays of departed leaders , lets be honest today no one is interested in such occasions except being a vote bank ,I agree this leaders then contributed so statues are installed , now maintaining this statues on every of the Birthday , Death Day several tonnes of flowers are wasted garlanding the statue in such was that the face also is not visible ,million tonnes of water is wasted washing statues and place nearby lets find innovative way

0 0 Please put responsibility on local municipality and RWA to the maintenance the statues.
3 0 There are nano-coatings available based on silicones, which are very fine material which when applied on the statues, develop aa fine high skid coating on the surface, enabling any accretion not stick on to the sculptures/ statues, and just wiping of with a cloth is good eneough to clean the accretions like bird droppings, soot etc. Government labs in CSIR, DST, ISRO, BARC etc can develop these nano-high skid materials to supply the same anywhere in the country.
1 0 Dear Mr PM Countries like Singapore etc are predominatly importing their grains from countries like India and other SEA countries. Why can't we have a proper business model to share the investment from Singapore and export a fixed percentage of grains to them back as a return. This will improve job creation, investments, and relationship with our friendly nation.
0 0 Dear Mr PM Do not too much focus on these small objectives. Is it possible to link Ganga with other rivers. Everyday the cost of "linking river" project is growing. Divert the funds by providing work to farmers to work on this project, bring some private partnership, tourism, transport etc for this project. Every indian citizen will be happy and it is permanent problem (1) Job creation (2) Agriculture (3) tourism (3) Power (4) water transportation (5) GDP etc.  Please consider

0 0 JHS-BZM railway electrification on single line has been till handed over to RE, mins it is a new electrified section age only 3-4 years.  But in yard 80% existing structure must be cut due to wrong OHE Design by RE. They provide PORTAL in every step in place of TTC/Single Mast.

0 0 Railway electrification now going through all over the India. But in the attached doc. there is nothing mention about the posting guidance of OHE mast. Previously the track centre (TC) mention in ESP is 5.3m i.e. when the minimum implantation was 2.5m (2.5+2.5+0.3 = 5.30) but now it modified as 6.5m (2.9+2.9+0.70) for minimum implantation 2.90m. It is so clear that in between track traction mast should be provided and railway electrification should be design on single mast location for reducing
0 0 Memorials of great personalities should be equipped with self employment / skill developmemt training centres or in any form of employment generation centres.
0 0 Dear sir, I think for better execution of "Swachh Bharat Mission" there should be a penalty provision(e.g. Rs 200 public smoking fine) if any person throw any garbage or plastic bottle  etc. on road or at a public place. Also if any person want to stop them then these people should be given some helpline No. or police support so that before throwing they should think twice.

But Road opposite to his great statue is named after USTAD BADE GHULAM ALI KHAN, A pakistani classical singer. Governments must change it to "Bharataratna Babasaheb Bhimrao Ramjee Ambedkar Road" From Basheerbagh upto charminar in Hyderabad
0 0 #StatueCleaning Today Amdekar jayanti, but his teachings are being distorted to suit each ones interests by different groups. “I like the religion that teaches liberty, equality and fraternity.” -Dr.BR Ambedkar But how many religions in Indian Union are following this advice of Ambedkar. Indian Union must test all religions for Constitutional values,respect for Citizens duties,Directive principles etc.

0 0 statutes of our National Heros, Freedom Fighters and persons bringing glory to Bharat should be covered with glass so that birds etc can't dirt these. there should be sufficient light in the glass boxes and arrangement of water for cleaning of the statutes at least once a week. The family & personal details of such hero/person and his contribution to bring glory to the Nation should be written in sufficiently large letters in Hindi/English and local language
0 0 1. Names of trains can be kept on the names of martyrs (from all forces) as a tribute to them. 2. Dependeñts of the martyr can be treated as VIP in the particular train and also exempted from fare. 3.

0 0 Sir, as we are private sector employees, you can imagine our daily work load. I would suggest that in every just make compulsory 2 days continuous off in a week. So that we can contribute at least our 1 day for nation building. This will implement "Win-Win" situation. 'Cause due to this decision people will become glad, our country will get manpower at "zero" cost, & sorry to say but, your government will become stable for years. You can publish a list of work to be done on at least 1 day.
1 0 Sir- I would suggest that we make use of prisoners sitting idle in Indian jails. We must use them to clean government schools, highways, bus stands, railway stations, public parks. I have seen this in USA and it benefits both - the society and the prisoners. This way prisoners keep themselves fit and healthy. Prisoners in China are manufacturing cheap goods and that is why Chinese things are taking over the world. By Surinder Kumar Dhupar

1 0 We should be more tolerant about our behavior towards animals and birds, have some patience and contribute at your own, which you expect from others, enjoy serving animals.
0 0 Stray and pet animals are a major source of litter in Delhi and prevent clean living. Moreover, in Delhi, pet owners allow their pets (often unlicensed) to litter on roads and in front of others' houses without any fear of law or concern for others. The matter directly concerns the livability of our city. It also poses law and order problems causing physical and even armed scuffles. The litter affects traffic which poses risk to pedestrians. State government is not concerned.
1 0 I am residing in a society and it has been observed that people do not pay the maintenance charges of society  as there are no stringent rules,which may compel the members to pay the maintenance charges in time so that cleaning and other works of maintenance may be taken up.Therefore,there should be some ruling in Cooperative society act that the member is compelled to pay the maintenance charges within certain grace period.Automatically the services will be better and cleanliness can be assured
0 0 The main problem which people face in disposing the waste material(Kachada) is that people do not find the dust bins nearby. As such there should be a policy of providing certain numbers of dust bins per 100square meter of common areas such as markets ,shopping malls, Railway stations ,Bus stand,schools and Residential societies etc. Also, their frequency of cleaning should be written on the bins, like it is written in railway wagons for their maintenance dated and next date of return.
6 0 1)The states and center should take initiative to control the advertisements posted or fixed on the Paintings or statues of the great PITA's of the nation. 2) The teachers should bring awareness among the students to know the details of the statues of Great fathers of the nation where they located. Their teachings of the lessons of our great fathers should include this. There may be chance to took initiative to better appearance of the statues.
8 0 its not actually related to this matter but to the SWATCH BHARAT ABHIYAN sir it will be great if each and every rapper it may be of a chocolate or of something big, it should have one logo of clean India or swatch bharat on it. because we people used to through it on streets and on roads. so it will make a good reminder.
2 0 India should be spiritual capital of the world. This is the same country where women consider self respect, honour more than life. When invaders tried to capture queens after killing kings in unjustfully fought wars in the name of religion, the brave rajput queens jumped into fires to save their honour. Such is the greatness of people of this country. All religions are one. Humanity is the only religion. People are the only god. Dharma is the most supreme. Justice is the only refuge. Jai hind.
0 0 India is country of moral values thats why it has been able to sustain the hundreds of years of invasion. The values protect the people, make sure that there is love and care for each other. The poverty as a result a result of foreign rule has caused many problems bt at the same time it has brought people closer to each other in this adversity. The people of india needs to be united and work for united cause of humanity, peace and happiness. Also people should not be running after money only.

The most important is to connecting Ganga river to the southern part of the country, where we have drought situation. At the one part of the country there is flood and at the same time there is drought, even if we cannot connect the river, we can draw a cannel or a pipe system, so the water shouldn't be wastage and it will reduce flood in Bihar. Sir this is the plan which will improve our GDP

They will definitely appreciate our efforts to walk along and we will have chance to make ourselves and next generations more disciplined.

Such people are not working for India but against India. Make a law. Save this country.

Nominal fee can be collected towards maintenance of the place and salary of the guard.

After filing of income tax return only 4 to 5 % cases were come in the ambit of scrutiny assessment and because of that most of the person being able in tax evasion. Our govt has very less employee in income tax department to deal with the situation. If Chartered Accountants of our country becomes part of scrutiny team then surely the revenue will increase.
2 0 Sir...I have this suggestion. Government can instruct all Corporations & Municipalities to maintain the statues of great leaders along with public support.A small information sheet about the leader where the statue is placed can be distributed to create an awareness.Statues near Schools & Colleges can be cleaned by the students as an assignment. This will make them to know about them.On the cleaning day they can give a speech about that leader. This will help youngsters to involve more.

0 0 Remove reservation and also ensure no politics in colleges/universities. If any students get involved, they should be immediately restigated. These students create problem by getting involved with politics. If you want to see India as a skilled country, then it should be on merit and not on caste or class.also if you can make children aware by combining law as a mandatory subject from class 5 they will not go in wrong direction.

Please upgrade this and remove the caste system. Bring in a law that no reservations. Who has skills will get job.
0 0 Dear PM, Cleaning of statues is a good initiative, but would also insist that the real heroes of freedom does not have many statues its only very few people whose statues are seen on every corner of road which are cleaned once or twice a year for republic day and independence day and gandhi/ambedkar jayanti. People need places to live and these statues are placed with lot of spaces around on the main roads. Please widen the roads and reduce the spaces for statues.

I also suggest that to minimise costs in this regard MGNREGA workers should be used. Please instruct the concerned ministries to report every month on the progress.

Example Madurai in Tamilnadu with a population of 14 lakhs having potential for green transport but provision or discussion in master plans are missing.

0 0 Really it is appreciable and awesome job. But I thought we have have to stop making statues. If want then built in schools and colleges because most of our peoples they don't have home they use to sleep on roads and near to statues. Instead of making statues we should make shelters of that money and give name of that statue to that shelter. eg. Subhash Chandra Bose AAshray, M.G. AAshray,etc. And those poor peoples keep that place clean also. So might be this is new step for Swachata mission.

1 0 To the Honourable Prime Minister, Sir, Just one suggestion regarding Swach Bharat, Clean India Campaign. If there are waste bins installed at bus stops and other common places, I think that people, including myself, would use them instead of littering around. Right now, in most places, I think, there is none available and hence people are forced to throw things here and there. Same also while travelling in vehicles. May God give you the strength to take the country forward with a giant leap!!

0 0 #StatueCleaning Few things to be noted here: 1. Statue should be covered on the top and on sides through see through walls since birds are the first and foremost that may spoil the statue. 2. A spinning wash tubes can be fit on the walls and it should be operated once every day so that the statue is washed automatically and cleaned. This has to be done during 2-3AM since it is during this time, the vehicle movement will be really less. 3. #MyGov can appoint volunteers for this process.

0 0 India must expedite the Chabahar Port Project in Iran. Delay in execution of the project will adversely affect return on the investment in the project. India must insist upon finalization for participation as per original terms and conditions in the Farzad Gas Field. India must increase its exports of engineering and capital goods to Iran. India and Iran must continue its Rupee trade initiated during period of sanctions. India must strengthen the enabling factors for increasing trade.

The related buracates/administration getting such high salary is not accountable for their responsiblity. Material used in maintaince is low grade.
0 0 Congratulations for the initiatives.Public places, surroundings, inside home all can be cleaned.But how to clean the mind? For that many steps in parallel have to be done. (1) Students from KG has to be taught self cleaning. Children from 5 years can be made to clean their plates, glass, lunch boxes etc. and cleaning the space where they sit and eat. Children from Class 5 onwards can be trained to clean their class rooms and premises. Actually when we were children we used to have 'sewana varam'

So, keep up the process of cleaning up the nation until its crystal clear inclusive of being corruption free, free from any kind of disease like bribery etc. So, keep up the process. India has the potential to grow and become a developed nation like US.

1 0 #StatueCleaning, #MyGov  Our National hero who deserve respect should be highligheted through statues. At same time there should be restriction in constructing statues in public places by individuals , religious people .  there were many communal disharmony happened in country  due to erecting unwanted statues
0 0 set camera on public places .so that people affraid of making city dirty !

0 0 govt can take initiative to provide dust bins with low cost to all houses. this inculcate the people to make their house and their environment clean.. cleanliness should start from our house.. so schemes required for dust bins ... especially for poor people
0 0 when we are talking about statues cleaning mission of our leaders.... first of all their image should be cleared properly and honestly through an independent agency...many times we listen/read about Nehru, Gandhi, etc. on social and social media..which seems true.... when the heart will clear only than the statues will be cleared...

0 0 PM Modi has created a new way of involving citizens of India in the Governance. It will benefit the nation. Thanks Modiji.
0 0 Corruption in the local administration bodies has created a kind of apathy in the people towards the public properties and monuments. Strictness to the bodies is essential requirement. Retired people can play a significant role in movement. So their involvement should be increased.
0 0 #Statue Cleaning Accountable to the District Administration and through it, make responsible to the local NGOs have a duty to arrange proper arrangements for cleanliness and through them to aware the people give a space to local NIC website where people have to register their name with full address along with 5-10 mates or society people to take participate in cleaning to statue.Provide online certificate to people who contribute.If 10 statue in city,should Regis.20 group in a day 4 mor to even.
0 0 Why we avoiding to use CCTV everywhere ?? If we use CCTV every where and every city then most of the issues can resolve like Crime control, People will help to keep clean our cities in fear of CCTV and many more things which can be corrected if we increase use of CCTV. Government need to set CCTV in every City and a control center where someone will watch 24*7 and I am sure it will help a lot to people and government as well.
0 0 pl ensure that there are adequate dust bins. How will people throw garbage properly if there are not enough garbage bins???? Pl enforce strict penalties for traffic violations... Far too many traffic violations taking place..... please do the do-able things rather than only announcing big schemes. Small but effective steps that make difference to lives of common people are very important
0 0 # Sir I think there might b strict rules against people throwing carbage in the streets ! Govt should take fine from those people. CCTV should be given in all the roads.

0 0 Implementation of 7th pay commission at threshold. Why the common man is taxed by giving House Rent Allowance to those officials living in their own house. House Rent Allowance is a compensation given by the government where no government accommodation is provided. A debate is essential whether a government servant living in own house is entitled HRA. If this practice is stopped that amount also  can taken for nation built.

1 0 IN MY OPINION THE FIRST INITIATION OF SWATCH BHARATH MUST START FROM PANCHAYATHS BY PROVIDING NEEDFUL FUNDING
1 0 We should also start campaign from rural places.we are doing more focus on urban develpoment.at the time of every area must  be developed.i would like to share my opinion to take state's education.primary schools are not giving right education to children .they are only time passing.they are not supporting in education develpoment.Very soon i would like to start campaign agaist teachers those who are not teaching to children.they are only making money ......they are getting think about education
0 0 Simple cleanliness of the premises and statue of Bapu at Ridge,Shimla and all my student health workers made by swasth vyakti,swachh Bharat campaign in schools was deeply satisfying today i.e.matrydom day .
0 0 1.Please ban plastic (covers,bags etc) as much as you can. 2.Many BJP MLA's and MP's not involving much in Swachh Bharat then how we can  expect it from other party members and other party supporters( Also here many people are thinking it is only for BJP so we have to change that thing). Public servants and govt. officers should involve in this mission monthly/weekly. 3.To do Swachh Bharat is primary goal but we have to give awareness to people for not doing dirty and all. 4.
0 0 education should be completely app based.so everybody can acquire education of national level and can be learn more effectively amd gov should sell EDUPHONE(Educational phones)which will only use in educational stream and gov should sell that phone at selected centres with cheaper price.
0 0 Regarding Polythene bags being used by vendors, I suggest to run some advertisements for the households to carry recyclable bags as we use to do when I was a child. Its time to visit the good olden days again!
0 0 Dear Modiji, Thanks for all the initiatives that is been taken. I suggest that Statue cleaning can be taken up by the private corporation sponsors and in turn should be provided tax breaks. Off course there has to be some inspections in place to check the completion of work.
0 0 sir/m'am, one more thing. I know this is not concern with this topic but sir/m'am there is lack of information media for yojnas..most of time there is yojnas but there is lack of information to people about it. and media of today is shows advertisement more than yojna awareness.. sir if possible pls make a separate website and app..where all the information regarding yojnas is available. so that people who wanted to know or tell other people they can use it in better way..thanks. #myyojna
0 0 some amout should pay to panchayats or municipality or nagar-paliks in order to clean it. and amout should pay pr statute & make a app or something like that where people can review about it that work is done or not..if not they can review directly and government directly can say to panchayats or municipality to do asap.

We cleaned 15 areas & contributed towards #MyCleanIndia which indirectly connects to #StatueCleaning (Bringing Smile to others life) as well as 2 Statue (Swami Vivekananda) Cleaned by other team at Varanasi.
0 0 Dear Pm, I will take this opportunity to share my views on this issue, it's okay that we must maintain cleanliness at public places in our beloved country ,this is outside cleaning, but we have to change from inside, our internal cleanliness is earn the money by legal ways, so no to all type of corruption , make peoples aware of benefits of controlled & quality population , for this we have to create that sort of atmosphere throughout the country,for this make provision of funds in budget.
0 0 I request Modi Ji to provide free cloth bags to vegetable vendors, so that polythene just disappear from our Lives. Bless
1 0 The students reading in DAV HZL School at Dariba – a remote and sleepy mining location of Rajasthan – were elated to rise upon the call of the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi and propelled by their indomitable spirit, forty students from the Dariba School, on 3rd August, 2015, went all the way to the dusty town of Fatehnagar, 17 Km away, where a statue of Maharana Pratap gathered dirt on the crowded crossroads. They washed the statue, paid due obeisance and pledged to keep it clean.
0 0 I am writing this mail from Bangalore. I am very concerned about the cleaning and Garbage Disposal.Disposal. Unfortunately the situation is deteriorating and looks like complete machinery has given up. * The Garbage is collected in small open vehicles * Garbage is transferred at several places, every where spillage takes place which is no one's concern * People are finding difficult to segregate the Garbage (Plastic / Wet Garbage / Paper etc) Requires training. TV Ad can be usefull

0 0 Provide double Bedroom houses to poor people in cities, provide water and electricity to farmars continuosly, free technical and professional education to poor people....please work towards development of poor people and farmers is very important...
0 0 It is an innovation to make the nation enriched.
0 0 Apologies if I misunderstood. I thought #StatueCleaning was to remove our leaders statues from streets and put the with dignity in parks and enclosed  remembrance facilities. Please consider my suggestion to move statues "as much possible" to respectable place.
0 0 Dear Narendra modiji sir, we are all with all your going and future projects.Your team is on good path and we are all with you sir,and the same time i appreciate your entire team of NDA govt.This project will also get an full support from our entire nation.

0 0 Sir I think v shud start the work or campaign frm schools v should make realize the kids importance of cleanliness and importance of our leaders by making some kind of activity in school on daily basis like making them feel that are lucky to born in INDIA..And as far as statues are concerned your party should form youth groups to support your idea by GANDHIGIRI and make a movement by encouraging like minded YOUTH to JOIN THE MISSION ny many ways of taking support of SOPHISTICATED people of INDIA
0 0 When it comes to getting reacquainted with our National Heroes,  it becomes all the more important to make our youngesters acquainted with the lives of those who stopped thinking about themselves or their families and threw themselves whole-heartedly into act of serving the causes near and dear to the  people of their era. THESE PERSONALITIES STAKED THEIR PERSONAL STAKES FOR THE CONCERNS OF THE PEOPLE WHETHER THESE WERE SOCIAL OR POLITICAL; REGIONAL OR NATIONAL.
0 0 Suggest, we should ourselves take initiative to clean the dirty statues/photographs of our patriots, whenever we visit any office and observe any dirt/dust on the statue.
0 0 For the sake of national building, it is necessary to recognize, realize and put an effort to create an opportunities to the group of intellectuals, matured and well behavioral personnel with knowledge, people of rich cultural background with providing schemes to join, share and enlighten the society, state and nation by active participation with incentives for their financial support.  Because such category of people are either getting in middle class or poor class.
0 0 Good work Good Incentive Sir....I have seen in many state govt office Mahatma Gandhi Statue under dirt and dust...nobody cleans or give a tribute with Agarbatti and malla.I am feeling very much Sad...I am seeing all this from my childhood in Assam.
0 0 Statue cleaning is really a good start to clean the minds of the people. At least they will come to know what is cleanliness and how it can be maintained. No doubt, cleaning everything is good but rather avoiding to make anything dirty will certainly solve the problem of environment as well as ugly mind.
0 0 The Prime Ministe,  Shri Narendra Modi's call to the countrymen to get reacquainted  with the Nation's i oconic figures is an idea which deserves to be taken seriously. The only way is to try to always remain  "in touch" with any one and every one who played  a role in any aspect of our country's growth history. OUR'S IS A COUNTRY THAT IS PROUD OF ITS CULTURE IMPACTING THE LIFE OF ITS RESIDENTS FOR TIME IMMEMORIAL. EACH PHASE HAD SHINING FIGURES. MUST BE  DEVOUT TOWARDS THEM.
0 0 Sir, For setting up large scale industry,  Government  should acquire 200 acre area (approximately 10 lacs square yards area) in the market rate i.e. Rs 1 crore per acre it means 200 crores. There must be one rule for all industries i.e. 100 acre for the covered area, 60 acre for the open area for roads and transportation and remaining 40 acre area should be utilized for the socio economic works i.e. world class school, college, hospital, petrol pump with automobile service station, indo
0 0 All the public transport buses be fitted with a vacuum cleaner to for cleaner roads without much effort
0 0 If can as a nation educate the masses to stop Spitting in Corners of Buildings etc. which becomes a urinating spot & cleaning becomes difficult as it smells too much. dry trash is easy to handle by any Volunteering group. We have to aim at getting People to Just stop spitting. We can have a mass movement in which we click small Video of such people spitting in public place & selective Broadcast of these. Today 50% population have mobiles. The Video must be clear with face of person & location.
0 0 Cant we have two sets of books one for children who are good in studies and one for little weaker just as we have for english and hindi for class 9 and 10.afterall why teach a child theorums when he is least interested.this way we will have lesser dropouts and a better skilled workforce.the practice of passing everyone till class 8 should be abolished
0 0 Sir, Pollution in Delhi is going dangerous label and nonlegal factories is a big reason for that, these factories running in the night and left lots of smoke in the air, I knew lots of factories situated in our area in name of Mandoli industrial area (Near Nand Nagari Delhi - 110093). sir I request you to take a necessary action to stop these factories for polluting the air.
0 0 It is a matter of proud and pleasure to clean the Statues of national leaders who sacrificed their lives for the cause of the motherland.Unfortunately we could not take their blessings personally but at least to do this ideal work on moral ground too.Similarly,we should follow the advice of our respected Modiji to keep our city clean.
1 0 For reservation: Reservation may be to any extent.  But, in such a way that others are not affected.  As LPG subsidy has been cut for persons having income above 10.00 lacs; in same way reservation may be extended to persons enjoying income up to 10.00 lacs.  Other communities are automatically coming down.  After some time (years) higher class will be in minority.  Anil Mangla
0 0 Sir, I and my colleagues in NYKS are contributing their full for statue cleaning since 23 January till today in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. Number of statues of public figures have been cleaned by our volunteers, but we are finding it difficult to upload the process photos on this site. The app iVolunteer given to us for uploading is of some other groups. please help is in this regard.
0 0 sir, your Idea is very good. But it will take effect until and unless our young generation will not understand the importance of cleanness. And there should be a policing team (may be outsourced) who will keep eye on such people. They will be having rights to charge heavy penalty. Otherwise freedom is having this kind of black side. People are not even thinking about cleanness even they got warned. Here we must need Netaji Rules not Gandhi way. Jai Hind
0 0 Sir,  One immediate social reform can be done is that in three years, each new case may be decided by various courts i.e. 1st Year in Distt Court, 2nd year in High court and finally in Supreme Court.  It is need of the hour.  As qualification of Elected persons in Panchyat election has been appreciated;this will also be highly appreciated.   Courts can be in double shifts if there is any paucity of infrastructure.  Holidays in courts may be curtailed.   Anil Mangla
0 0 All the statues, monuments in India need to be cleaned and there conservation has to be done. Since I am in the business of conservation, restoration, preservation and cleaning of temples and heritage structures in India. I have taken up work of cleaning,conservation and repairs of Heritage Jain temple in Kutchch, Gujarat. I wish to undertake such innumerable structures exists across India. They should be cleaned by proper scientific instruments without disturbing the inter molecular structure.
0 0 Respected Sir, I know India is progressing but a few people putting it down with the vested interest. But under your valuable guidance it would progress and develop many folds. I request you to think over the increasing population and the teaching & research in Population Studies is somewhere in the corner. I think it is in the last bench of the class. In India, there are 18 Population Research Centres  located in the different Universities and Institutes which need your attention for care.
0 0 in every town or village school and college student should be encouraged to form a group along with school and colleges are asked to form group and to submit the work done by them to DEO and do work like statue cleaning, park cleaning, spreading awareness,
0 0 Sir, for people to participate in these kind of initiative, an idea is a citizen of this country on his/her birthday or dear ones birthday should contribute voluntarily in swach bharat, tree plantation, helping the poors, donating to NGO's, and a Janamdivas Fund for Poors should be created in which anyone can deposit any amount he/she wants this fund should be used for uplifting the poor, those who cannot take part directly can contribute here.
0 0 Sir, in rail all your efforts for rich class. For e.g. suvidha tatkal premium tatkal etc. But think about poor class who travels in unreserved class. I think number is nearly equal to those who reserve seats and the unreserved class who travels in 3 or 4 coaches i.e. 15-17=3-4 coaches. So i Request you to run a superfast unreserved train between major station.in persent such type of train is available but having too much stoppage and average speed is very slow.either boost it's speed or run new
2 0 Hon'ble Sir, After a long period our country has reached in the hands of a strong leader who can speak to the world in their eyes. You are a leader who is really concern about our future generation. The platform you are building all over the world for the growth of our nation is really remarkable for the masses who are really concern about Hindustan. As a Hindustani I am proud of my country and a leader like NARENDRA MODI JI. REGARDS.

0 0 It is great that a leader leads the nation with Pride and Proud which is missing in our day to day lives. Reason? disconnect with our history and taken things as granted. Cleaning of Statues of our leaders by us on volunteer basis will lead to connect with great people, their efforts and with our history. Knowing more about our country leads a upbringing of Proud Indian kids and adults which further glorify ourself as we were in so called Sone ki Chidiya time!!! I am volunteering myself and kids

0 0 Respected Prime Minister of India, I am residing at Trikarpur Kadappuram of Valiyaparamba Panchayath, in Kasaragod District of Kerala State. This land is a 24 Kms stretched island like between Arabian Sea at west and Kavvayi river at east. Southern boundary is the Ezhimala Naval Academy. I am the General convener of the Regional Development People Committee. We are struggling hard to remove the wastes from the river and sea, daily in the morning.Also we are growing plants in the river banks.
0 0 Please increase the budget per nyks program and spend of nyc volunteers
0 0 Its a great initiative that common people are contributing to cleanliness of statues, streets etc. Apart from this, civic bodies responsible for maintenance of such places should be made accountable in discharging their duties. Most of the government buildings in India are constructed with high costs but not maintained afterwards resulting into slum like situations people hate to go to such buildings unless compelled by circumstances.
0 0 #MyGov Mass Pledge is an excellent initiative to raise awareness in school children. Incorporation of the values of cleanliness and hygiene in children will create a better, safer and happier world.
0 0 All of Indian's are spend  every Sunday's some time for cleaning  of our "Mahatma's Statue , removing dirty from our nearest public places , cleaning roads, planting  trees in both sides of roads and public areas . Our Ministers , writers , govt. servants are  give to a  leadership of this program . I suggest a name of this program is " Clean India , Green India Program "
0 0 I have been cleaning the streets in my area by removing the advertising posts, bills from the electric polls, meter boxes, walls and trees every morning without fail. by doing this alone I found some changes like no more posts on trees now in my area and the number of posts on public properties have been reduced. I would request you to please introduce some strong steps like fine against those corporate bodies whose posts are found on public properties. It spoils the beauty of our country.
0 0 This must be linked to cleaning up surroundings&sustaining that on a long term than as a ritual.Ex.: With my wife went2 NIMS (Famous as AIIMS of Hyd) on 22-12-2015 The scene at (1) Toilets {both gents & ladies)adjacent to Millennium Block - Andhra Bank) was pathetic means one way entry to hell(2)Private Parking open defecate all over and smell to death. So nearest statue and NIMS can be clubbed

0 0 Video of Statue cleaning of Swami Vivekanandji. Present are Youth from Nandgram, Pasonda, Naipura, Shakoorpur etc.
0 0 Further to my post I have further to mention as under: 5.	The statues should be treated in the same fashion the way we treat our gods in the temple by keeping them clean. 6.	The respective ward officer’s performance to be evaluated as one of the performing parameter. 7. Lasers Cleaning can remove even the thinnest layer of dirt from delicate sculptures without damaging their surface.
0 0 I am Vaidik Brahmian not by birth or as Per B.R.Ambedkar's division of society, but by true values and meaning so; dare to state that installation of such Statues is a great nu-incense and hurdle at the public places. So I am deadly against the same. If at all any one or group of people deserves, let they have free choice to erect the same by purchasing the private land for the same but not any where in the public place. Same is followed to all religious Idols annual functions and processions.
0 0 1.	The statues should be covered with Umbrella to avoid Birds coming and sitting on the statues and making it dirty. 2.	Every Week the Fire Brigade with high pressure pump should wash the statues the time taken will be less as compared to manual cleaning. 3.	 The respective Corporator of the ward should be made responsible to ensure the Municipal Corporations take action in deputing the fire brigades for weekly washing of the statues. 4.	Garland Every statues after washing.

0 0 I have developed small scale biogas plant mainly to utilize the green waste accumulated in our surrounding areas. if such small scale plants are installed in societies or colonies, our garbage (green waste) problems will be solved at the base level only. In addition to that plant gives biogas as energy ,which we can use it for cooking and heating purposes. I am trying to develop even small scale generator to develop electricity so that our main problems of green waste  will be solved.

1 0 #StatueCleaning, Primarily I see this great initiative of PM as like cleaning our parents / grand parents photograph frames at our home, simply because we respect and are beneficial to the ideologies and heritage that they have awarded to me and my family. Can we see home beyond your own house....what could be that....Society, Street, City, State, Country and whole World....Surprisingly We will find many such great heroes, who had sacrificed their lives for our better life.

0 0 All the temples should not be allowed to use PLASTIC.  Endowment departments should be instructed strictly not to allow plastic usage. Temples should adopt a school in the vicinity , if they are sound enough or they should get the funds for running schools. Each and every temple should establish OLD age homes.  If they are not sound enough, they can approach BIG temples.  Construction cost of the homes should be born by the inmates.  maintenance, etc.should be taken up by temple authorities.
0 0 Our Nehru Mahila Mandal pledges to generate awareness towards cleaner Indian and also cleaning of Statues of great Personalities. Photo of one such activity uploaded herewith.
0 0 Respected Sir, It is the best move to pay the respect to nation. It is our inclusive responsibility whether Public, Private or Government.But the responsibility weight should more on schools and school children so that: 1. They could be aware of clean India Movement. 2. They could receive the positive learning by frequent visiting these "MAHAPURUSH" 3. They could respect and assimilate the seed of harmony and unity. 4. They could be able to save the path of Nation's Builders.
0 0 Statue cleaning action has been remained  neglected for long which has been reminded by Hon'ble PM to bring awareness among people. Appreciable step.

0 0 yes i will do it.thanx sir Again this is a great effort for clean INDIA.
0 0 I will Also do it with my Friends
0 0 make "medical council of india" transparent
0 0 Sir, This is great initiative but its need some rules and regulation to participate state govt along with the people. In City it can be done to fast with the help of increasing liability on RWA's of societies. RWA can make a group in their areas and weekly participation of resident. Movement need to be extended at lower level. Further that movement of cleaning India can be further charge with involving college student as college students can spare good time to educate people in their area.
0 0 the medical council of india is the organisation which is responsibel for quality of medical colleges & in turn about the quality of medical graduates who will be the future of health care of our nation. issue is that the MCI is controlled by capitation mafia & contributing in manufacturing doctors who have money but nothing else. this is detrimental to the poor people of the country. please clean MCI from corrupt people who are sitting there for decades.
0 0 I will do it with my Friends #StatueCleaning
0 0 Unless and until polythene is strictly banned throughout the country nothing is going to keep the country clean.

1 0 Nice efforts to pay respect to late LEADERS with campaign of  #StatueCleaning  ---------But Sir cleaning of  Corrupt system of our country should also be priority of the Government-----------!!! I am retired Manager of INDIAN BANK and not able to get my MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT to PENSIONER for the year 2015 in spite of my repeated request to the management -------even my repeated emails are not responded by Head Office Thus a set back efforts of DIGITALIZATION INDIA   ----When our system work??

0 0 Respected Sir, I do not only participate but take lead in various cleaning missions in & around the area that I live. But today I felt that I should put in few of my words hoping that you would appreciate if the suggestion has value. Sir, such a big country cant be cleaned with Jhadu. I think mechanisation is the need of the hour. Truck vacuum cleaners, automated scrubber etc should be shown in the Swachh Bharat Ad which would increase industry volumes making another Make in India success story.

0 0 StatueCleaning is one of the better achievement for cleaning India.
0 0 Dear res. Sir We want to set up the dust bean in our village.sir I have donate some money in this work.if you help me some in this good work.pleaae help me. Swatch village swatch bharat.
0 0 It is not the duty of Government to keep the statues clean; as a true Indian, it should be our duty to keep them clean. Because, during many occasions we are the people giving examples of them to others.
0 0 It can be done as a responsibility by every citizen and be initiated by students as S.U.P.W. Project in school,by gov't offices alternatively month wise like January;month of municipal corporation,February;month of police department,march ;month of health department and so on...at the end of year in every district best month should be declared by D.M. Then it will be a work of fun and reputation....
0 0 Main hurdle in #StatueCleaning is that the promises are locked as a result we aren't able to enter it and clean it. #MyCleanIndia
0 0 any strict measures taken  by govt will have political -opposition retaliation-but like the battle field, govt should move forward and it will HAPPEN one day and it will be put in to practice-Slowly people will start accept it- LETS be clean and make india each town-village-city- country clean in the near future- Lets all try it out- dont be selfish-be selfless
0 0 Pl mention in MAN KI BAT about PMKKKY for mining affected area so that This great efforts provides fruits soon..
1 0 Respected Sir, Recently in our District one girl committed suicide as they don't have toilet and using open toilet, constructing individual toilets for each family requires more money instead if each village some public toilets may kindly be constructed on war footing basis under 'SWACHCH BHARAT PROGRAM' of hon'ble PM
0 0 The Govt has certain view/s about each concept being in mind or introduced-The channel which it takes or the Medium which it adapts is very Important with easy understanding ability of millions here in India- It is not the govt or the Thought behind is to be blamed -it is the People -it is our own country men to be blamed for not following it- Sometimes, it compulsory to Exercise control with constant supervision.every individual-every single political person-student-Child-Youth should follow
0 0 To get better result,pl involve corporate,NGO,SHG based around rural area in a structured manner under time based monitoring....Things are moving..
0 0 Felling proud to be the part of this campaign, we should shake our hand in clean environment with not only the voice or in social media comment but also on ground zero level around us.I hope will be a clean India soon.
0 0 EVERY WHERE SWACHA VARAT ABHIJAN IS GONING ON THIS IS ONLY HAPPANING BECAUSE OF OUR HONB'LE PM MODI'S MOTIVATION TOWARD T STIL SO MANY PLACES THERE IN INDIA ARE NOT KNOWN ABOUT THIS .IN OUR VILLAGE SOMANY PEOPLE ARE DOING TAILET AND LANTRIN OUT SIDE ON ROAD SIDE.SAUCHALAYA SCHEME OF GOVT FAILED HERE.THAT MONEY IS 50/50 BY EMPLEY OR ORGINASION AND PUBLIC .NOBODY MAKE LATRIN.SO GOVT SHOULD DONE REALITY CHEKH THROUGH OUT SIDE ORGANISATION SO THAT PEOPLE ARE AWARE ABOUT ,THIS MONEY ALSO THEIRE
0 0 Swachata Abhiyan will be success only when government put to much heavy fine.....................
0 0 ALL THE BEST
0 0 Sir, Yesterday I listened that our country has improved in rank of lowering corruption.I think this can be improved more by doing all govt debts payments fees stamp duty by Atm cards or any govt provided electronic card and if people are not having that facilitate them this card then and there in every Deptt . By this three things can be done . People having no bank acct will be financially included 2 black money will come to bank 3 corruption would controlled upto some level.Pls aware it.
0 0 Welldone modiji.  In tamilnadu many statues are in dust.   I will also try to clean them. Thank u for your prime motive.
1 0 Swachata Abhiyan will be success only when government put Dustbins on every half kms. on road.
0 0 In most of the urban houses people use modern days sophisticated water purifiers which obviously filter the water to make them drinkable but lots of water during that purification process got wasted and we use to waste that non-drinkable water without having alternate beneficial use of that water:
0 0 Being an INTACH member, I was thinking on similar lines - to create a team and clean our monuments. Statue-cleaning is a wonderful initiative and I would love to play an active role. Do we need to take permission from the authorities for this?
0 0 Save the girl Save the Country..............
0 0 Hi Sir, Its a great honor to have PM like you in my country. But as an citizen of India, Please dont mention government in every initiative you move on with, As we all are Indians and we will be Indians, and instead of MYGOV if its MYINDIA that would have been every nice to hear for all the Indians. Thank You sir for this wonderful opportunity.
0 0 Cleaning India is still far away because the cows and dogs are still free to make Indian roads dirtier.cleaning statue not so important .they are dead for them no difference
2 0 A great initiative indeed. Yet, it is my suggestion that governmental regulations be introduced to control, if not disallow the installation of statues in the country. Those who contribute to its proliferation do not realise that:- 1.  The public at large is no more enamoured with this stale and self-serving concept. 2.  Te rightful place of legendary personalities is in the hearts of the common man. 3.  It is outright disrespectful to leave the statues unattended.
1 0 NM is trying to do too many things. He should concentrate on the economy. Jaitley has failed to get double digit growth. He must be replaced. So should some CMs who have lost local elections.
0 0 Great idea i Always with my Gov.
0 0 GREAT IDEA WE NEVER SEE LIKE THIS PM GREAT INDIA AND GREAT PM NAMO
0 0 In my childhood,during 30-40s Queen Victoria Statues were kept spotlessly white and clean. These days there is craze to build statues, even of living politicians, but thereafter no attention is paid to keep them clean and attractive.All municipalities should be instructed to detail a person to clean up the Statue in his area every day.
0 0 Insist to local area representative (councillor of each municipal wards & MLA of all states of city) motivate them area people to join this kinds of activity & provide individual responsibility then great result obtain within near future. wish you all the best for success to every country people.
0 0 great idea proud to have lIke this PM of Bharat
1 0 It's a great idea by our respected P.M. sir" Sri Narendra Modi ji " Cleaning Statue" Thank you for

0 0 This idea is best way for our India
0 0 It's a great idea by our respected P.M. sir" Sri Narendra Modi ji " Cleaning Statue" Thank you for
0 0 Really Our beloved P.M's Statue cleanining Idea would make great awareness in the citizens mind about thier National leaders and thier serivces in freedom achievement.Jai Hind.
0 0 Instead of building new temples, the money can be utilised for renovation, cleaning, etc., of the existing structures.
0 0 I have due respect for our national Heroes and I would be more than happy to clean voluntarily. But if we would like to maintain the cleanliness over the statues in future also, we need to create an organizational  structure & process, where duties and proper resources are assigned to government authority (Municipality, Panchayat etc) of respective area of statue location. If we want to maintain the honor to statues of our national heroes than we can not rely on volunteering every time.
0 0 Might be tears in the eyes of Netaji, Patel ji after having such thought. Modi ji you are great
0 0 Dear Modi Ji... Today world is getting known about India because of ur sincere efforts and I thank u for that.. When we think of cleaning things why not even the policy of crime on women. I didn't get a forum so addressing here. Pls quickly introduce a policy fr acting on rape and crime on women seriously. Every single bharathiya Nari will keep u in their heart and mind and workshop... Pls clean our old policy and make women safe in India. Jai Hind......
0 0 Public debates should be organized near the statues
0 0 Good to utilize services with ( shubh bhawna ) . Self   PRERNA  witnessing  such statue  is the best . Second thought - News papers / awakened citizens  will point out unattended / uncleaned statues &  with invitation . Better through festival of joy . Work with enthusiasm One circle on each sunday  ( Manorath ) be organized  as seva is  performed  in temples .Excellent idea of get together .  CLICK THE MOMENT OF JOY  &  TWEET .
0 0 Noble souls, noble statues! Noble thought, will have a noble ending!! Let this be a start!! Let's keep the statues always clean!! Form citizen's committees to maintain these statues!!!
0 0 Might be tears in the eyes of Netaji, Patel ji after having such thought. Modi ji you are great
1 0 it's very good thoughts
0 0 Dear Mr.Modi, Cleaning is a process at grass root levels. It should be made as an international participation. It should be a festival and it should bring people together. It is difficult to unite people internationally, but it is quite easy to conduct cleaning campaign by calling international volunteers to work with our local school children and cleaners and public for 100% participation. Teach them young. Recognize grass root cleaning workers.
1 0 Dear Sir, It's really a very good initiative sir...it will keep all the statues of our Nation clean as well as the love of people for those legends will definitely increase, and in this way people will keep remembering our great legends! Hope, this will become a great mission & all Indians will participate in this mission...I wish all the best for this Mission! Jai Hind...

0 0 RIGHT TO INFORMATION-Govt.offices most of the information officers are not reply to your letter,appellant officer has noticed to information officer but he has not answering and not present in the case .If you are going information commission information officer has not come there because he know that commissioner is his supporter and he is ex govt.employee.Now what can a person have do for justice ?

0 0 A very humble suggestion. We render service to the Society by way of goods/services and get income therefor. INCOME therefore is an Index of CONTRIBUTION made to the National Wealth. Similarly SAVINGS in the Banks are in the nature of CONTRIBUTION to the Society as Banks make use of it again and again for productive purposes/Nation Building. Hence abolish Income Tax as such. BENEFIT as reflected by WITHDRAWALS from the Banks be taxed by progressive TDS.

0 0 There are quite a few reasons that compel the farmers to commit sucide , the most vicious being the high interest loan from local Shahukars who first lure them and then coerce them. This is an age old exploitation in India. There can be a simple solution to this. Enact a law that any loan given to any one in cash without a legal document duly registered with the IT authorities will be null and void. Such loans made in cash out of unaccounted money and the loans are realized by force/coercion.
0 0 Respected PM Sir, To minimize unemployment in India, I would like to suggest to start online/offline work through home or cyber cafe with weekly or daily basis salary because lots of talented people has not being benefiting and not been selecting because they don't had a degree due to some some region. But they had better talent compared to degree holders.
0 0 BSNL should utilize staff wisely which is not done wisely .In BSNL staffs are not utilized properly due to division set up as Technical /Non technical . this is the main reasons were BSNL is lacking and that is due to mismanagement of Technical staffs in hire post as GM, DGM, DE, SDE they all think them self as all known one person to get the fruit from root to leaf. Kindly see upon the matter to save BSNL.

0 0 #StatueCleaning, To start with lets clean photos of your elders @ home  who are not with you unfortunately, this may give feeling of happiness and can lead to generate due respect to the great people's statue. Every work should be done with interest and respect, else it will become mechanism, which I believe our honourable prime minister do not want.
1 0 sir, with all due respect I want to say that peoples does not do any thing in free but want every thing in free. we should give this work of cleaning statues to our municipality head and certificate of what they will do.
0 0 #Statue Cleaning. Hon'ble PM Sir, You are rightly pointed out to clean the statue of "Great Indian Sons" at the right time. only inauguration of statue is not the proper way to pay homage. every day cleaning of that statue & remembrance during statue cleaning time will effectively strike the great work of that great leader in the mind of statue maintenance personnel. near my house there is no such Statue. so I decided to clean the photos of leaders in my room. and I am Carrying out"SANKALPAS" .
0 0 We must not lose sight of the fact that a good number of our youngsters are absolutely ignorant as  what these great personalities stood for and what encouraged them to do what they did for their Motherland. This can be done only BY PREPARING BRINGING OUT A BLACK AND WHITE VERSION. CONSERVING THEIR DEEDS FOR POSTERITY WOULD BE THE TRUE TRIBUTES TO OUR NATIONAL ICONS.
1 1 I have an idea that can make for effectiveness in this regard. By the help of a robotic drone statues can be cleaned easily & effectively if govt provide support to me I can explain it very well. Thanks. To modi sir for the innovative step.
0 0 Hon'ble Prime Minister Like we already have Swachh Bharat which is doing very in almost all the India, we should have one Swachh Pados (Clean Neighbourhood). Actually I would request if we could in all our India have some portal like here URL http://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/reportit would be great. Here any citizen can report the issue related to cleanliness etc in his neighbour. I am a computer programmer could write this program in days but only after Govt. permission. Best Regards
0 0 Sir, My topic for discussion here is to enhance agriculture output which serves as the backbone of our economy. Under the 100 day work scheme in which sufficient is not being done, people working under the scheme can work in farmer's land thereby they will not end up in paying the labor cost. Which in turn will encourage more farmers to agriculture currently which has a lot of input costs which reduces the interest of crop cultivation along with burdening loans and farmer suicide
0 0 Cleaning the statues of our National Icons is the way to reacquaint ourselves with what these pious souls lived and died for. This should be converted into a bye-yealy affair -- on the occasions of their birth and death anniversary  -- re-calling the important happenings of their era. A Nation cannot afford to let the memories of these persona fade away.A NATION OWES IT TO ITS HEROS NOT ONLY TO PERPATUATE THEIR MEMORIES BUT ALSO TO ENCOURAGE YOUTH  TO  EMULATE THEM.
1 0 #StatueCleaning On every auspicious occasion in the family we have to clean statue in our vicinity as pay our homage to these great heroes.
0 0 Hon'ble Prime Minister I am an Advocate in Supreme Court from last 20 years. I just want to say that crime, corruption and law and order problems are the base of all the problems in India. Strength of Our police force and subordinate and higher judiciary must be increased at least 4 times and all public places like markets, roads, police stations etc. must be kept under survellience through HD GPS system and CCTV cameras and concerned officer must be punished for default.
0 0 Thanks PM for making the things that real Indians have in mind come true ,by uniting everyone with right mind set. Democracy has to be people based that's what this government shows.

Ambedkar's Statue in Bangalore, As you have instructed to us in last Mann ki Baat. An interesting fact about we people is that we firmly believe that all of the world’s problems can be solved through “awareness” and then magically someone else like the government will fix it. It is our country! Letsball keep it clean by Working together. Proud Indian! JAI HIND
1 0 #StatueCleaning Please notify a model code for establishing "Statue".Provide water connection to clean the statue on a regular interval.
0 0 Sir, My submission is not regarding statue. But it is about a very important subject. Sir, in India in most of the English schools, Mercent of Venice by Shakespeare is being studied by our children. It is full of hatred against jews. If it is bad to spit venom against a religion, it is bad  to generate hate for jews in  children through this play of Shakespeare. Kindly do something.

0 0 #StatueCleaning an important initiative most of the time which gets underrated.
2 0 Statues have become a nightmare to public. We have encourage administration to place statues inside parks towards corners not in the middle. On the roads and junctions a strict ban on any statue.

0 0 Dear PM it is good concept but not practical. I suggest that to clean India you need to impose laws and fines nobody use helmet for safety but to prevent themself from chalan. These elected member should also feel responsible for there wards and action should be taken for not performing there duty as a soldier is held responsible at the borders. Change is needeed from top to bottom but in India Reverse happen and the the story of developing nation goes on.....
2 0 Dear PM, Cleaning statues in a day or week doesnot give good result.In our country there are many person still not having proper work or goal. Please appoint them permanently with salary and their only duty is maintaining a statue or few roads regularly. So that statues and roads may be clean permanently. One day campaign of cleaning roads never help us. Every government building must have permanent cleaners not in few numbers and it may eradicate unemployment, unclean roads etc., JAI HIND
0 0 sir recently i read a news that kalicut dm gives biriyani party to those who helps in cleaning the lack as same bjp must start a campaign that in each city who will give most in cleaning statue will get party from any officer or from mla etc.
2 0 clean statue is a great idea of our government.On special occasions these statues are cleaned and our leaders offer flowers and garlands.  This is the duty of leaders and citizens to keep clean.At the time of unveiling statues , a proper cleaning strategy should be made.Only clean statue will give respect to them.These statue are our heritage. Our clean statue will give good message to the foreigners .This will strengenthen our tourism industry.
2 0 Cleanliness is very important as it results in hygiene and disease free society. Like Singapore, India should also penalize people for making public places dirty. It is every citizen's duty to maintain cleanliness in public places. Public places should have garbage baskets every where in the city. I pledge to put garbage in the baskets and not throw away at any place.
0 0 The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra  Modi has given the call to his campatriots for reacquinting themselves with their National Heroes. The call has come not a day earlier than required, especially for our youngesters. Rather,  very many youngesters have no knowledge, or, if  at all have only periphiral knowledge of the lives and sacrifices of known heroes of our freedom struggle,  what to talk of those who vanished at the altar of Motherland,  unsung. THE YOUNGESTERS HAVE TO GET ACQUAINTED.
1 0 Dear PM sir, One side your good self doing effort to make/ create  good relation with  foreign countries for "Make in India" concept  other side some corrupt office  harassing  MNC ( who is  participating in  Make in India)  in the Name of " Make in Him self" by demanding  bribes other wise issue unfair order in the  name of  Arms length price. even on  Small  small transaction.Which  gives  bad impression of INDIA in front of Foreigner Investors. Please look into this.......
0 0 Sir, Cleanliness should come from inside. More lessons and practicals on cleanliness and keeping our atmosphere clean to be introduced starting from LKG-UKG classes till 4th or 5th standard in schools.Students are to be induced to clean in their villages/towns through recognition programme through panchayats etc. parents also  learn keeping clean.More stories on our military personnel who died protecting  our country from enemies/terrorists induce them to be patriotic / respect our nation first.
0 0 Modi ji people have very strong feeling (pro or anti) for these leaders, whose statues are to be cleaned. Feeling of hate towards these leaders, who have divided us into religion, caste, etc, is more widespread. So this campaign wont survive for long. But there is unanimous respect for all soldiers who are martyred in war. Please initiate national campaign for installation of statues of all soldiers of armed forces, right from 1857 war, at places of their birth and for their proper upkeep.
0 0 Jai hind Mr.PM sir, I want to tell you a lot of problems, all not my own but related to our people,but if it will be my luck then only my problem reach to you orherwise it will lost anywhere.
