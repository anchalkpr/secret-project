32 2 Real Demonetisation should start from within. Let's rise high above all discriminations, regional language preferences, eradicate reservations based on regional quota in each State in interest of Team India. Any person from any state should be given job purely by merit regardless of his religion, caste, state, mother tongue. One nation, One Anthem. Swatch Bharat is the day when no Indian is denied an equal opportunity to work in any state of India. Say Loudly "I am an Indian" Jai Hind.

4 0 It is said Government Officers/officials have responsibility to give foundation to vision and aspirations of political leadership. But any foundation  without innovation would be futile effort in any adventure. In Government Hierarchy there is so much stifling environment that innovation seems far cry.plz open some avenue of fresh air in this matter also. As it would serve common men a long way. I am not of opinion of any revolution against rank and file, but innovation within contour.
9 0 Sir myself (Ravi Prakash) will like to share that Shopkeepers and trader's of our area (Vikaspuri-New Delhi) have again started demanding hard cash for daily family needs and daily expenditure. Initially they were accepting Debit/Credit cards or Paytm app. But now it seems that they have gone fearless and now again demanding hard cash. So whole demonetization drive will go waste if Shopkeepers and traders did not accept Cashless Payment. Some hard action is required to check Black marketing.
8 0 Dear Sir,  please do not leave the culprits who have tried to derail the demonitization drive.Crores of new notes have been recovered from politicians,bank officials, govt servants.Please do not spare them. Punish the guilty so that others should have fear to involve/support in cheating. Please send out a strong message to the people that the guilty has to be punished and removed/debarred from their current job.People are not afraid of law because of the previous govts.We are with you sir

Seeing anti-English propaganda,sorry, it might be worthwhile to make Mumbai Union Territory.

0 0 Sir - Please give a very very strong message to all who are trying to derail the noble initiative of demonetization & curbing corruption.

2 0 Dear Sir Make all the governance more transparent. For eg: in the housing sector, if we want to register any property, due to lack of transparency, the government officials demand kickbacks.

Requesting your kind attention. There should be a digitized process /dedicated portal   wherein the process is automated.

0 0 Demonetization is good move against corruption.We need to achieve 0 corruption.There are many factors for corruption-1)reservation 2)subsidy & free facilities 3)fee reimbursement.Due to subsidy,Low-income people have stopped working & became lazy,Hence Labour cost has gone up & effected agriculture sector.Due to reservation & fee reimbursement,undeserved students are being educated & are lacking quality of knowledge & not able to face competition.New education system to develop as industry needs
0 0 Respected Prime Minister The matter of Demonetization is not very clear in mind of population especially in the rural area. Also the people are confused about effect of demonetization and require confidence about the same. Please take up this point again.

0 0 #MyGov #PMonRadio everybody are talking about demonitizations ,its problems and its implementations.But nobody is thinking about online security .As this money banned in India,cyber security and hacking cases are been increased .So implementing strong technical support for online security must be needed in order to make Digital India successfully .
0 0 Need of More Homely Old age homes Government, NGOs, Religio  Organisations , NGOS, Corporates all to unite and set up more and more different types/class of old age homes, these homes to be set up by converting big bungalows, homes to old age homes, allotting pockets of land from 1 acres to 5 acres at various surroundings of Bangalore and constructing old age homes. The old age homes be free and also semi luxury and luxury. The main thing is to create the best homely atmosphere.
0 0 Need for Pension reforms The concept of pension in India is biased, only the rich, elite, they are enjoying it, the really poor, lower income group they are not getting any benefit.People are getting pensions upto Rs. 80,000 plus also when they retire they get huge benefits, added to this they have this CGHS and other free health benefits. A retired garment worker and other workers,  he will get Rs.500 pension or no pension, they have to pay huge money on health because they have no free hea
0 0 Instead of wasting crores on these useless advertising and self praising use it for practical social service project.Take this example if Shri Modi visits Bangalore his party and followers spend so much money in placards, flexes etc. instead why not use the amount to build a bus shelter, Bengaluru needs minimum 200 bus shelters, 200 pedestrian crossings

1 0 The funds of all political parties should be brought under income tax regulations. Currently the funds below Rs 20000 are not subject to scrutiny. Every political party should be held accountable to every penny received in their fund. Just like people of India stood by your decision of demonetization, they expect that political parties too are are brought under the ambit of income tax laws.

0 0 Respected Sir, I'm very much confused who is mor important a person in an Ambulance or the Minister/MLA/MP.  going with police sirens(front 2-3 vehicles and back 2-3/or more vehicles for security). I think to stop the passing vehicles to be stopped near signals how its done when a Minister is going on road .
0 0 to bring every child to school we need to focus on teachers school buildings and students. we should have a national mission for primary level and high school level teachers. our school buildings are still collapsing. A good and attractive building with clean toilets and provision for some sports can help to bring the students back to school. dirty toilets and old and bad looking schools wont help.
0 0 Everyone has to give the proof of from where they get the new currency notes with the source and i hope this will work. We have enough time to print 1K rupees note or just 500 rs note and that will definitely able to stop this game of black money. I hope this idea can work.
0 0 Let's say if someone gives black money to submit in bank, then bank need to ask the peoples that when did they withdraw this amount as everything is recorded that who is withdrawing how much from their accounts. So, if someone only able to withdraw 1Lakh from bank till March 31, they should not have more than 1Lakh in 2K currency notes and won't be able to submit that money in any case. That will be the actual surgical strike on black money.
0 0 let's say once 2K currency is going to demonetized by March 31. Then what will happen. The ones who converted their money through incorrect channels has to submit the 2K currency back to the banks and they have to search people to submit their money. Now, we know that we do have limits for the withdrawal which is 24000 per week which comes around 1Lakh per month and the records of the same has been maintained at banks.
0 0 It is an idea on the demonetization. Let's demonetize 2000 Rs currency note by the end of March 31, 2017. Most of the black money holders already have converted their black money into white by changing the currency with the new currency and putting the amount in the other peoples accounts. The ones which was exchanged from bank back doors which we all knows is and was happened. We do have limits decided to withdraw the money since Nov 8. let's say once 2K currency is going to demonetized

0 0 Sir, I have been following the Demonetisation with great interest and think that this is the greatest thing that has happened to the country.We now have a feel of who are all definitely against the interest of this country .

I for one am convinced that it is simply marvelous that the government&RBI of a country of this size and population is responding so fast to the needs of the ordinary public

1 0 Sir we have given our ideas on this pdf if you watch and show us the path about this it will beneficial for both us and the entire nation. Thank You for giving us the enormous opportunity to share our ideas and views with you.
0 0 Respected Sir, When demonetization is made, Government has to ensure the availability of new currency to all people. How individuals are getting crores of new currency whereas we common people are not getting money for our daya to day transaction. Please take action to stop this and use that money to fill the ATM and bank for common people use. we need answer why 2000 rs currency was printed.We do e-transactions wherever possible. For 100/200 rs transactions what we have to do.
0 0 Sir, Now a days, every financial transaction is turning cashless and made thro' ONLINE.  Please think over in arranging the financial services of Post Offices (eg. savings deposits; PPF and many more) also in-to ONLINE so that the amounts can be transferred thro' NEFT etc. thus carrying physical cash and also clearing of cheques etc (which will be increasing now onward due to financial year ending) can be avoided.

0 0 My idea is to create awareness of the significance of the digital payments system through Mainstream Media. Most of the media houses own many TV channels, newspapers, Magazines in English, Hindi and regional languages. We need to incentivise the Mainstream Media houses to discuss the importance and long term benefits of going digital in a concerted manner at all levels throughout the country. Roadshow and local language programme should drive this for the media. #MannKiBaat #MyGov

2 0 Honorable PM of India, I would like to bring to your notice about the quality of education in India. I am telling from my experience I see in my life and when I talk to kids. Now a days nobody is taking teaching profession as a career, but by fortune or force. When I ask kids how many teachers in your school are PHD or MS or Mtech. There is not a single one. This is about big schools. Small schools pay 3K to 8K to teachers. So you can imagine the future we have in coming generations.

0 0 I would like to share my idea on this topic which will lead my country to a developed nation from a developing nation. Sir, The seminars and other such things should be organized in the schools, colleges, universities and other educational institutions as well as other organizations which are headed by Govt Of India. This will lead the students and others to know the benefits of cashless economy. It should be mandatory. And the proof regarding same has to be submitted to Govt Of India.
0 0 talk something more on education and the great jobs which our scientists are doing including the recent research at IISc Bangalore which will make wifi speed 1000 times faster.IISc beat IBM research centre USA in this field.
0 0 Sir,I am very happy for demonetization personally but one experience I must share to look at negative impacts like In complete Punjab,all banks & ATM were closed when I visited this place(11 Dec 2016).Due to demonetization no cash available with people.Robbery got increased with visitors coming from different city & state.Purse snatching has increased lot in main road & markets in day time openly.Please sir,My request to take some steps for such negative impacts as well which make suffer baldy.
0 0 Sir, Quality of education has degraded to a level, where it needs your dire attention or it may uproot the strength of the society. Appointment of teachers, guidelines for continuous professional development, grants for research activities should be fool proof and no scruples. Heresy, bribery at Vice-Chancellors level for recruitment and research grants, it is demotivating for those who really upkeep their ethics and modesty with life. Please take this as your agenda in anti-corruption action
0 0 Sir the Central Government has started the digitized india platform for digitization of documents last year. But the site for the most of the year become non-functional. It would created opportunity for earning from home if properly operated. Also central government should bring legislation to bring all the digitization of documents all over india under this platform compulsorily thus would create opportunity for earning as well as digitization work will also get momentum.
0 0 Update post demonetization. Assurance that from Jan 1,2017 cash withdrawal will be easy. Update on up skilling India.
0 0 Respected sir Money transfer using *99# is most suitable for village people as it doesn't need smartphone,net,card and pos. But unfortunately very few people are using it. To promote this system may I request you to appeal people to donate Rs 1 to PMGKY using MMID and mobile no of PMGKY. If @ 20 cr people do one transaction we can truly go for cashless transactions.
0 0 Hello sir, I want to discuss this idea about providing micro loans to small time vegetable,fruit,flower vendors in big cities. The idea is to request and incentivise finance and micro finance companies to set up micro loans stalls at big markets in all Metro and Tier1 cities. Loans can be provided after registration of the vendor using Aadhar/other IDs. Loan disbursal is done based on the repayment record of the vendor. The vendors can be advised to use digital payments only #MannKiBaat #MyGov
0 0 Sir, I share your concern of corruption and lack of knowledge that has hardwired into our present society. Opinion reserved- Health and education, recruitment should be based on merit only indiscriminate of caste, gender etc. Being a psychologist, it is my view that lack of education and training in their own field paves way for indifference, profit and power motivation and gross mismanagement/disorganization. Build schools/hospitals to reach the outreached and provide free services.
0 0 Sir, Right to job is our constitutional right. But the maximum age for entry into the central govt. service is 27 years. Thus deprived many eligible youth for getting the job only due to the age bar. I personally think there should be any age restriction for entry into the govt. job. Thus violate the our constitutional right for job. Only the age cannot decide the eligibility of a person, everyone should get chance to prove himself/herself. So i earnestly request to consider the proposal.

0 0 Corruption has been on PM's agenda. Instead of talking about punishing the corrupt, PM needs to talk about reforming the corrupt. Talk about ill effects of corruption and how thousands of people are dying every day due to corruption. PM needs to know that the corrupt govt officials are just like common people but with misguided ideas on money and service. They are not hard-core criminals. Unfortunately they are made to be corrupt as they paid bribe to get govt jobs. stop the vicious cycle.
0 0 Prime Minister sir four ways to curb black money from abroad- 1.Use mutual assistance pacts to ask another country's govt to share details of certain individual. 2.German french way to Bribe senior officials of banks and get data. 3.Arrest officials of Foreign banks who don't oblige with details. 4.last is UN Resolution on corruption of 2005 in which one can pass a law saying all indian accounts in to countries are hereby nationalised.UN will oblige to help.

0 0 Respected PM sir, At the outset I want to express my congratulations and best wishes for the bold step of demonetization. I want you to look into following area. In India Land Records were not updated timely.

Moverover, at the time of land acquisition, compensation to the right person also ensured. With best wishes...

0 0 Sir, Referring to CAG report on New Indian Express dated 21-12-206 on misclassification and misappropriation of funds towards grant-in-aid, Suggestion- Cash Cards for every single project funding or grant-in-aid. Operations can be made only with swiping of the cards and no cash transaction/bank transfers. The funds be debited to your centralized accounting system and final audit can be corroborated with both field level books of accounts and your system based financial statements.

0 0 Sir,I really feel this small things which happen with people like Robbery,Harassment,Keep waiting in banks & hospitals.It make difficult & stress full life.I at least expect police do investigation completely & update each&every steps taken & response to person who has given FIR.In my purse snatching case police don't even put efforts of searching them through CCTV available on road.This kind of people must get punishment so will think 100 times before doing it again. Sir we must stop all this.
0 0 Respected Sir, First of all, I would like to thank you for such a great move of demonetization for the welfare of people of India. I want to share with you regarding our education system. According to me, the main purpose of getting education is to become knowledgeable. But, being a student, I have realized that our theory-based education system is delivering less knowledge with a lot of stress among students. It is not good for youngsters. Kindly pay attention. Thank You. God bless you.
0 0 Sir, I have made a report on the problems that common people are facing in the common era and a possible solution to them.

I humbly request you to look into it. Thank you sir. HAI HIND!

0 0 Health is one of the major expenses for which people keep cash at home. For the less cash initiative to be successful,this expense has to be covered. First step would be to encourage people to get health insurance..Government/private. Second is to allow smaller and medium size healthcare services to provide cashless services. Today the list of empanelled providers is miniscule compared to the actual number of healthcare facilities.Insurance companies should hasten the process of empanelment.
0 0 Sir, I like cashless system.Now we have no problem to handle bank transaction.But sometimes the availability of internet is too slow.So improve the internet connection and keep 80% cashless system and 20% cash system i.e huge payment more than Rs.5000/-is compulsory bank through and below cash only  allowed  2 or 3 times in every month.Will not allow any discount in cash payment and pay  discounts only cash back offer or electronic wallet.And reduce the credit card interest rate.
0 0 Dear PSji (Pradhan Sevak ji), We can use our highways and Rail tracks for solar power panels as most of these highways and tracks are remain unused for most part of the days.

0 0 SIR, Instead of income tax,charge super luxury tax on all items above a particular amount (for  eg:15000 or above any kind of transactions). This will fetch government a large amount. Also if so remove all taxes on food and daily use items.This will reduce money inflation as well as price inflation. Also this will increase the income of government instantly. This idea came to me because all people make black money to buy all these kind of luxury items.

0 0 One surgical strike on Real Estate is required. As a honest tax payer, I'm not able to afford a housing. Link all Property details to Aadhaar, those who do no have Aadhar registration the property should go to government. That is the only way to make the housing affordable and common man can live in own house.
0 0 Dear PSji (Pradhan Sevak ji), i would like to suggest you to do something for poors and farmers. Rich are becoming richer while poors are becoming poorer. Please reduce the difference rate of wholesale price and retail price as all the profits are taken by middle men. A Potato for which farmer get Rs 2 per kg is being sold at Rs 20 per kg to retail customer.
0 0 Respected Sir, We are for a cashless and digital India. Now almost all institutions accept payment through NEFT or e-payment after registration. However, there are still some core Government departments such as DOT, WPC (Wireless Planning Commission) etc. those insist on payment by DD (Demand Draft) only. This increases hassles at both senders end and receivers end due to logistical issues. It would really help if all Govt Departments are instructed to accept e-payment only. Regards.

0 0 A Win-win idea for govt with no cost. Public transport (Buses & Local Trains non a/c) should be free for commuters. To recover the loses, govt can charge aprox Rs 1000/ house in annual house property tax (500 for train + 500 rs for buses). To reduce operating cost of Buses, buses can go for solar power / cng etc. Conductors can be converted to drivers as no conductors required. If implemented, traffic & pollution will be reduced to great extent and govt can save on fuel import cost.

0 0 Sir, When gas cylinders are delivered at our house we have to make payment in cash. The person delivering the cylinder is a layman. He cannot accept digital payment. We should be allowed to make digicash to gas dealers at the time of booking only so that cash transaction is avoided.

1 0 Dear Sir,When a lie is repeated a thousand times, at least some people start to believe it. I believe it is time you talk about it. Congress ruled the country for 60 years. Who will have black money abroad, if not Congress? They created the big corporates in India and now they want you to destroy them. Ambani, Lalit Modi , Mallya, Sahara etc.. They gave the loans from the bank without securities, they ask you to get it back. They left the people poor, no bank account and you are blamed...

0 0 Dear Modi Ji, I fully support your act of Demonetization but people are still facing many issues. Why can’t we take Steps for stop taxing the vendors for using card less than Rs 100. If We take this initiative Small vendors Like Vegetable sellers , Fruit sellers etc .. will start using Card machines and People also will not hesitate using Cards. In Railway stations also we can use cards for Local trains and People will Start using Debit cards. I have attached a file for brief description.

Disability and poverty go hand in hand and most importantly there is a lack of job opportunities for them. Apart from this, we need to ensure all public buildings should be accessible. As a society we need to be more inclusive.

0 0 Dear PM, I support demonetisation. To make India a less cash economy I would suggest accepting payments via cards at every government counter (e.g. railway reservation counter, electricity bill payments). Also promote card payments in rural India by giving incentives on it.
0 0 Digitisation move is great initiative .Since govt is serious is curving black money,please initiate reforms,simplification in various govt organisations. Passport seva is a great example,where TCS and govt are involved.Similar initiation required in stamps and registration,income tax ,excise tax,RTO etc. Please target all govt depts paperless by 2020.India has got so many IT companies .Govt has to use them in large scale.
0 0 Countries like India must need demonetization in order to curb the black money but what really happening is unfortunate. I was surprised why nearly 80% of the ATM's are not filled with cash, even the ATM's which are associated with the branch.

THANK YOU MODI JI. YOU ARE DOING GREAT JOB. I HOPE IT CONTINUES.......
0 0 Digitisation effort is very good move (10/10), but it needs proper infrastructure. Even now internet facilities are not proper in many places. This should be improved and taken care before making any such move mandatory.
1 0 I would suggest a number of steps and I hope most of the steps would be appreciated by all, unanimously and won't create any havoc like demonetization. It would be good if you take BOLD decisions to do any or all of the following steps. 1. STOP PRODUCTION AND USE OF PLASTICS IMMEDIATELY 2. PLANT TREES AND CONSERVE ENVIRONMENT(MAKE IT MANDATORY FOR ALL GOVT. EMPLOYEES) 3. BAN PRODUCTION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND ITS USE STRICTLY 4. BAN ALCOHOL USE(RELIEF FOR WOMEN & CHILDREN) #MannKiBaat
1 0 Sir, why there is huge differences in salary, facilities, benefits etc given to common men and politicians? Politicians get much more even if they don't work. The examples are given every year in the parliament. They don't pay taxes, they are given so much of incentives even if they don't attend the parliament and complete their duties. We have biometric attendance system, we pay taxes, and we struggle a lot for every thing. Although this won't be easy task, but please take care. It will help.

3 0 Dr. Yash Hathi here. My suggestion is regarding steps to curb rising population and solving associated problems. Increase the minimum age for marriage for girls to 21 and for males to 24. This will also provide chance for females to complete their basic education [college] and not just 12th [18 year age] thus can be independent. Also the two child norm. Rising population is the root cause of almost all the problems India is facing directly or indirectly.
0 0 The efficiency of our Judiciary should be increased. The speed of the cases running in the court should be increased. When today there are so much cases pending in the court, then to it goes on vacation for 2 months. A country like India which such huge population and many pending litigations, we cannot afford the vacation of the high courts. My humble request is to revolutionise the Judiciary to make it more effective and efficient in delivering justice.
2 0 Regarding Children Adhaar procedure:Resp.Sir, As per attached file&current procedure for children below 5 years no biometrics will be captured. as per my suggestion if children biomatrics details updated by born or after 1 or 2 years it will benefit for children parents if the child will be missing and identified by someone, if identified person go with adhaar center the children details identified very easily. pls do something as child below 5 years unable to talk and identified their parents.

This appeal can be only done by Hon PM Modi since the youth relates to him and his appeal can be on Mann Ki Baat.
0 0 1. Why all the TV Channels should not be held accountable for all the tele-shopping adds. It will lead to sell genuine goods instead of fake and reduction in corruption. 2.

In this way it will be easier for people to find medicine and reduce corruption in medical profession, and reduction in price of medicine.

As now all parents are rushing their children's to public school (even my son is also in one Public school) what i realize, these schools are making the students compulsory every year at the time of admission to buy the new books from there respective schools (course materials are always same except some minor changes sometime). My concern is, why we cannot use old book materials there brother already studied. This is a kind of business.
1 0 The MyGov portal does not allow users to start discussion threads on the issues of their choice. I have several suggestions but often there is no discussion to post them. MyGov should allow users to start discussions on any subject of their choice. Users should be able to tag the relevant Ministries and officials from the concerned ministries should interactively participate in the discussions. If MyGov implements this, it will become a much more vibrant and useful facility. Thanks.
1 0 Banks are reluctant o fund a Startup company. Innovations under India Startup are, therefore, facing financial bottleneck and entrepreneurs running here and there. I would suggest Govt. of India to seriously ponder to bring out an amnesty scheme wherein balck money/old currency to the tune of 5Cr can be invested in India Startup without any penal action within 15th January, 2017 and locked 7 yrs interest free. The move will make India 100 times stronger than one time VDS tax.

0 0 My suggestions are to speak on : 1) Administrative reforms that will make government servants of both center & state to be more customer friendly and helpful to common man and there concerns. This is specifically with respect to Police who have the reputation of being worst in terms of helping a complainant, they literally threaten complainant and avoid registering genuine grievances of public. This is my own experience as an educated individual, its apparent what is fate of uneducated.
1 0 As this is a demonitization time, my suggestions are to speak on : 1) Corruption free India, 2) Rural digitalization, 3) Awareness on online transactions in the rural area by youth, 4) Providing fund support to the NGO's for educating on rural digitalization, online transactions  & their benefits & advantages. 5) As common public are getting disappointed on looting of ₹2000/- notes by influencial people, ensure & give confidence that the looted amount will be recovered.

0 0 I am a govt servant posted at Delhi. To give a digital push, following are my suggestions 1. Make all govt transactions digital e.g. various utility bills. Give attractive discounts to those who pay digitally. 2. I have seen that there is a reluctance from the trader community to accept digital money. Make provisions to accept digital money compulsorily while renewing their licences. 3. Right now problem is that the common people wants to pay digitally but traders are not accepting it.

0 0 Sir, I have been working in a psu bank as branch manager and posted in Naramada District for six months now. It’s a rural branch and as per my observations in the field, farmers are highly agriculture illiterate here. What I mean is they just grow cotton –a kharif crop and do nothing in rabi and summer season. When our government is putting so much efforts along with so many types and kinds of subsidies for them, then why they do not grow rabi crops.
0 0 All legal works related court and police fines and other government related matters must mandate payment by credit card or debit card only.. All big and small companies must make direct payments into employee accounts .(No Cash Jobs ). In this way we can reduced corruptions and black money and we can catch corrupted people in School, Hospital, colleges and in legal department as well. Sir I think this are few steps we can concentrate on .. Rest it will work automatically .. !!
0 0 In hospital all payment must made by debit or credit only ..  so people can use their debit or credit card to make all payments and everyone has proof of payment .. and they can show under tax boxes also. In schools and colleges you must mandate all payments by credit card only so we can avoid big donations ..Don't even give options for cash. I see people pay lot of donations towards child's admission and parents gets frustrated .. You can banned donations requirements ..

0 0 Our nation should stand as one against regional preferences of any kind. It should emerge stronger by demonetizing reservations and discriminations. Regional attachments are respected but nation is superior. Any Indian should be able to get a job anywhere in India purely based on his genuine merit without any discrimination unless the job itself needs specific regional language proficiency. Until then any initiative like make in India in international paradigms will quite remain be a joke.
0 0 Dear Modiji, It hurts to see small kids being used & forced into begging on the streets of our country. These innocent children are hungry, ill treated and abused. Even though our nation has right to education, free meal, no child labor / abuse policies.. millions of our nations future - 6 months-10 yr old kids beg. Action needs to be taken against the begging syndicate(incl.the local mafia, police and government),pick these kids up by will or force and train them in army / special schools.

But still she was asking "Which state you are from ?" This is shocking. I am sure,things will be even more embarrassing in future; thanks to 100% local reservation by K'taka. I fear that "I am INDIAN" won't be welcomed in any state despite they may make sure people stand for National Anthem even for regional cinema.

0 0 Dear Modiji,I believe that government should do something for handicap. I have seen, that in most of railways station there's no facility of lift. By adding Lift in every Platform it will have much benifiet to Handicap and Normal people. Firstly,Handicap people they can easily travel from one station to another.They can't climb them-self in Train because of high level entrance in Train. Under every seat of Train, there should be a Dustbin. Special space & Facility of Toilet for Handicap People.

0 0 Dear Sir, Employment situation is in doldrums. Already there is a turmoil and employment disaster due to demonetisation and international market. To add salt and chilly to the injury, heavy reservations are being sought based on local state affiliation and caste, now even in private. This is a blow to meritocracy. Its sad that your genuine efforts to uplift nation by imbibing a strong national spirit is rubbished by some politicians sheltered totally under reservation banner.Pl save meritocracy.

In order to make smart city road more durable the Government can use the Recycle bottles, plastic material which is in waste form.

Requesting you to put some of the rules on all private schools and colleges as well.

2 0 You can apply this same logic to States also. This year budget give UNION BUDGET allocation to only two states. Only these two states will get economic boost this year. The following year some other two states. I think this definitely help. Instead of dividing Rs. 100 into 20 segment, try to boost only one segment with all Rs. 100.
1 0 When they are in gvt job..self dependent n earning money..then why they enjoy or fight for high jobs.,with a tag under sc quota..,
1 0 The following year no need to allocate any money for the same segment. With the amount of mony and projects it can survive on its own for many years. The next budget government can do the same with any other segment(department). For example: Allocate all Rs. 100 to power sector. 1) Foreign investment will also flow in and the entire country will be surplus in power for years to come.
0 0 Respected sira After going through the views of people, one questioned arised in my mind as it happens around me only... Obc quota to rremove ho rha...sc quota is still lingering ... i see sc class people already in government job ..self employed self dependent .. earning inxome from government by doing govt job...but still they are appearing for other exams like ssc cgl ..for higg rank job...BUT ENJOYING SC QUORA AGAIN THIS TIME.. PEOPLE ALREADY IN GVT JOB..SHOULD ENJOY THIS SC QUOTA

0 0 Dear PMO, Please consider this example to plan the budget. Example:- If the govt has Rs.100 to spend in the next financial year instead of dividing Rs. 100 into different departments/segments and states, allocate all the money to one particular segment ( power or agriculture or roads/infrastructure). Concentrate only on one segment for one complete year. The benefits are: 1) The particular segment will get unprecedented boost. 2) The work will be visible for public.
1 0 Respected Sir, My suggestion is directly regarding Cashless system. Sir today we r in the era of a golden change. I as a student is blessed to be a part of it. Me and my society are ready and truly supporting the Cashless initiative. This is really a good step taken by any govt. But sir pls ask the Colleges too to be in support of this. As a student i am really facing problems, where we are unable to pay our fees as the inst. is only asking for cash. Pls ask them to accept digital payment.
1 0 sir please stop writing on new currency in Indian rupees .
0 0 My suggestion is to sort out the problems of residents of cantonment board.Civil Bazar of Cantonment Board must be attached with State government(municipality).On its behalf central government should ask for the area equal to the civil bazar area from the state in which cantonment is situated or it can be  settled through consideration.CANTONNENT BOARD IS NOT AN DEMAND OF AN HOUR and it reduces the speed of fast and transperant governance.This method was adopted for AMBALA CANTONMENT(HARYANA).
1 0 We can show gratitude to warriors and nation builder by saving a mountain on his name rather than building their statue. Lot of mountains are destroyed to build cities and constructions.

Promote wooden home industry:House in new planned cities shall be like US,Japan style, least use of stone easyRenovt

0 0 Dear PMOI, My suggestion is for Swachha Bharat. A lot of waste due to use of plastic/glass bottle of cold drinks or any other consumable items are generating in our country. I have seen in Germany that the all beverages companies are giving facility called "Pfund". The purpose of "pfund" is some amount will be taken as a deposit during the purchase of beverages and there are machines which collects this bottles and give a refund. This discourages people to produce waste. Please see the link....
0 0 It should be made mandatory for all restaurants to have toilet facility.	Most people do not use public toilets because of non-maintenance of hygiene.	Wherever public toilets are made, it should be in sufficient numbers so that hygiene may be maintained.
1 0 Sir, The whole nation is focussed on demonitisation, but I want to slightly divert your attention towards recruitment process ongoing through Staff Selection Commission. Rcecently SSC counducted CGL 2016 tier 2 exam.But due to technical problems in the system, a huge problem was faced by the students, me too was the victim of such technical problem. How ever SSC announced re-exam of few centres,I also want to give re-exam.I informed to PMO earlier
0 0 All offices, banks, housing societies, temples, police thanas, post offices, courts, Registry offices, market complexes, shopping complexes and doctor’s clinics, clinical labs, should have sufficient number of toilets for public. Legal provisions need to be framed.
0 0 All business transaction above 5 lakhs should  not be allowed in cash, like purchase of Car, jewelry, registry of land and house. These transaction should be only through electronic mode or cheque or draft. Certain transaction like purchase of coslier items like mobile phone worth above Rs 25000, TV set  Rs 50000/ bike worth abvoe Rs 100000/ booking of air tecket or five star hotels, sale of costly wine /liquer etc should be made only through electronic mode.
1 0 Respected Prime Minister,We are very proud of your commendable efforts on demonitisation. We the people of India appreciate nature and diversity. Why we need to associate a colour reffering to “Black” or “White” money to represent evil or good? Nature gives us all these colurs and nature is full of positivity. We should rather use “illicit” or “illegitimate” money to express the money earned or collected by illegal means. Please inspire the masses to use these more appropriate words .#MannKiBaat
1 0 In respect to Mann Ki Baat December 2016, I want to suggest that, the assurance and encouragement to agriculturist, small people that hon.

In next talk, follow-ups may be there regarding these tips in earlier talk. 2.Demonetisation is a big and challenging task and collective and synchronised efforts may bring the normalcy in some areas where related problems are there.

1 0 Sir,I have to say that ,there are so many death occurs in our country because of high speed bike accidents .our Govt.runs various schemes to prevent road accidents,caused by motorcycles which is maximum.Sir,it's a matter of concern ,that we, the people are responsible for these accidents,as we don't use helmets generally.But i see ,many people ignores to buy a helmet with few extra cost even they buy a bike of Rs.50000.so helmet should come alongwith new kit at time of purchase.make it mandatory

1 0 Respected Sir, I am in fully agreement and supportive of GOI initiative to make Digital India and cashless economy. I have one point to make in order to achieve this. In our country where 74% is literacy rate, 15% population uses internet and 27% are smartphone users therefore we should encourage BIOMETRIC based transactions easier and reachable especially to villages and rural areas. Kiosks can be built is Post offices, banks where they can make their routine payments just by using thumb.
0 0 Sir, Government should take immediate step to allow mobile wallet to wallet transfer through UPI infrastructure of NPCI. Currently a citizen willing to use mobile wallet has to subscribe to multiple wallets which is discouraging and inconvenient. Wallet to wallet transfer will distribute the business to all wallet players and avoid a situation that PAYTM is going through.

0 0 Dear Prime Minister Modi Ji I appreciate your hard work and putting India in comfort Zone of world Map. You have faced many problems and hurdles to take India to this position. Still, a lot is to be done I pray GOD to give you GOOD health and energy to fight the enemies against India development. Even after 70 years of democracy still, we are behind the real development, as many small countries are doing much better than India.
1 0 Dear Sir, successful demonetization 1. Take account of each and every single currency exchanged from Bank, punish bank officials stringently with jail term who have misused and supported black money hoarders and seize such  such exchanged currencies. Funds meant for ATM would have got diverted elsewhere for commission, this needs to be probed. 2. Need to do something to catch big fishes including businessmen and may be politicians so that 1000 of crores of black money can be recovered.
0 0 Dear Mr Prime Minister, 99.9% Bank Officials who have worked day and night honestly for population of this country post 8th November need to be given incentive. Despite so much load and ever-changing guidelines, they have done their best possible to support this great move. Kudos to Banking system of India. Regards Dr Vivek Jain
1 0 Dear pmo , I have a suggestion, idea, request for you to improve our "post office's banking facilities" .Fully digital services like ATM rupay card , net banking , post office check service, instant money transfer from one to another post offices for officeil porpoises.By this idea "transction charges and service charges" will be reduce. post office is fully goverment so there is poor and middle class people will trust on that .By this maximum village of our country will cover
0 0 SIR, AS YOU KNOW YOU RECENTLY TOOK A NEW STEP TOWARDS MAKING DIGITAL INDIA. BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO PREPARE OUR NATION FOR MAKING IT CASHLESS OR FOR DIGITAL TRANSACTIONS. YOU & ALL IT IS NOT A CUP OF TEA. MORE IMPORTANT IS TO ENCOURAGE OUR PEOPLE [SPECIALY MY VILLAGERS] FOR MAKING DIGITAL TRANSACTIONS,BECAUSE WE HAVE TO CHANGE THIS HABIT NOT ONLY OF FEW DECADES BUT OF THE TIME OF RAJAS AND MAHARAJAS . HENCE I WANT THAT YOU ANNOUNCE 2017 AS "DIGITALISATION YEAR". AS THIS ENCOURAGE THEM .
0 0 I have suggestion to pass bill in parliament regarding "Recovery of money against property (public or private) damaged during protest from the responsible". This bill will deter some miscreants from damaging properties and we can save some money and time.we are building good infrastructures in our country and these miscreants damage that and we loose valuable infrastructure, money and time as well. So I have very kind request you to draft and pass such bill which is very much required nowdays.
1 0 Regarding use of AADHAAR for cashlesss transactions.  Since this is going to be easiest and secure of method of cashless transactions there is a need to maintain some privacy.  Since AADHAAR no is one and unique it is linked with all the bank accounts a person may have.  It will be desirable to introduce some feature such that a preferred bank can be selected for making payments otherwise all the accounts that are linked to AADHAAR no will be displayed on the mobile screen.
0 0 Demonetisation suggestion - Some rich people with black money have deposited their money in the accounts of poor people having Jan Dhan bank accounts. Some have even taken the cheque books of the poor people so that they cannot withdraw the black money. To restrict the rich people from getting back their black money, the old cheque books of Jan Dhan bank account holders should be discontinued and new, unique chequebooks should be issued in lieu of the old ones . Hope this helps!
0 0 Dear Prime Minister, Having different platform in digitization then it would be hard to bring the money transaction into an control all over India.  Government should have its own payment platform (gateway) for all the transaction of people of India. It  might be a School fees payment or any industrial purchase should go through the government gateway, no direct payment should be allowed. Due to this type of initiative people will get more benefits. Sample plan attached.
1 0 Respected PM Sir, Greetings!! we are very happy by your decision of Demonetization its really good move for growth of nation.We want to share one idea that please deposit the black money to every a/c in Bharat. means total collected black money divided by total no of bank account .by this way we can distribute the black money (Partial or Some Amount)to  Bhartiya account holder & that money will be floated in market. Pranam
0 0 Our respected PM Ji Kindly speak about time plan for dispensing  with anonymous donations of any amount . These be accepted only through banking channels. And monthly income and expenditure statement should  required to be filed by  every political party with election commission and put on its website for dissemination for citizens which will facilitate to cement your image as great statesman ever produced by country so as to implement demonetization effectively and to promote less cash society
0 0 Suggestions to curb Black Money. 1. Restr proposeict the monetary value of Cash transactions to Rs.50000/ 2 Restrict cash holdings to Rs. ten lacs. Wages to employees covered under the Shops and Establishment Act should only be through Bank accounts.4. Foodgrains should be brought under the proposed GST Act.Nominal tax  to be levied and credited back to the traders account. Therefore there will be no incidence of tax on foodgrains

0 0 Respected Sir, As you are aware at Malavalli Taluk, Mandya District are lacking from proper education even from 1st Std to XII of Government Institutions, children are unable to read/write their simple Mother language Kannada and English. Hence we need very serious attention about the children education. All compliance reports submitted are copied one from one or another, children are not getting worth education, due to which children are suffering from the quality education. Please help.
0 0 Demonetization is a very step against corruption that our central government had taken. 1. People faces little bit problems but stand with their government against corruption and also government and RBI doing afford to resolve problems of the people. But due some selfish person's million of people get troubles. Education is best way resolve the all kind of the problems that are country faces so,please also focus on Moral education that are important for making good civil for a country.
0 0 Respected Sir, per Hon'ble Mr.P.Chidambaram's calculation it might take 7 months for this free movement of currency, might be even though during Dr.Manmohan Singhji's tenure there was a balance of payments problem: we had to take loan from IMF by pledging our nation's gold; please try to solve this demonetization issue for the benefit of one and all. Thanks and Warm Regards.

0 0 respected Sir, Please request your kind that for public services like private practicing Doctors,Advocates and also Schools, Colleges for their payment, they should accept their payment in cheque/digital transaction to trace their account inbound instead of getting in hand cash. If not this will lead into escape from paying taxation. This will lead into common man trouble. Due to which we are unable to proper support from the government services. Please make some rigid policies ...

0 0 Sir,I am G.Chandrasekaran. I requested our Prime Minister to request the Public to share their hurdels/problems or how they had to give Bribe / Corription to get their rightful needs from the Government in my previous comments(Today). But I could not upload my Suggessions(they were in .rar format) 1.Electronic Money Transfer and 2.How to Prevent Corription. Now I have converted to .pdf and upload them. Kindly include these pdfs with my previous Comments.Sorry for the incovenience.Thank You Sir
0 0 The idea of demonetization is something i personally attest to whatsoever be the views from other arenas. However, it will become more promising if GOI passes a rule/Act or whatsoever it requires, that non even INR 1/- can be taken by political parties in cash and neither can their spending be in cash. If this is done, then 100% satisfaction will be achieved. Charity (cashless society)begins @home!
0 0 Sir, I have noticed that some big shops/cinemas  at shopping mall do not accept card/online payments.Kindly make it mandatory for keeping provision for card/online payments at those payments. This will lead to a step forward towards less cash economy. Pl give attention to agricultural sector so that harvest does not get hampered for fund shortage due to demonetization if agriculture production is good inflation will be under control .This will help you to fight against corruption.
0 0 2. Digital Payment: Extra surcharge of 2~3% levied by retail outlets on the use of credit cards. This should be waived off after the demonetization move for the promotion of digital payments. This problem is more common in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. This extra charge defeat the purpose of going cashless as we are paying all taxes while making purchase. Kindly look into this and waive off this charge. #demonetisation #MannKiBaat
0 0 Top officers who have reached higher positions in Judiciary/Administration from village background or backward reasons or under privileged people area.

I hope they can change people or initiate development of poor
0 0 1. Noise Pollution through Vehicles: Dear Sir, this is one of the grave issue in India. There is too much unnecessary honking on the roads which is so irritating and disturbing. Many people used to honk only for fun as if horn is a musical instrument on the roads, near hospitals/schools  many other places. Request you take this issue in your address and appeal the people for "No honking". Noise Pollution from vehicles need to be controlled firmly for noise free cities.#HornfreeBharat#MannKiBaat
0 0 Respected Sir, This is with regard to Swaachh Bharat campaign by GOI. I live in posh area in South Delhi and not far from my home is famous Max Hospital, Saket. Adjacent to one of the entrance to hospital there is garbage dumping area on the main road. The garbage lies scattered on the road in front of the hospital. In my view we should involve corporates , institutions and assign them the areas in their vicinity to keep the them clean and green and have them included in their CSR.
0 0 Just like "swatch Bharat abhiyan", its high time we have something call, swatch yatayat bahiya for Good Traffic sense. This is 2nd after cleanliness which puts us to shame in front of almost all other Nationals.This is yet again which calls for public participation just like the previous revolution and I am sure everyone would be keen and ready for something like this.
0 0 Your emphasis on e-transactions and using apps for making payments to various receivers of funds through this channel of e transactions. But, sadly there is no adequate provision for safety of transactions. Fraudsters play their game leaving the card holders high and dry. Without these precautions, the common man is bound to suffer heavily on account of internet frauds.  I am presently undergoing one such instance where a debit card and a credit card of ICICI Bank.
0 0 My respected PM, there is very high interest rate for education loan @ 9.70% to 13.50% for nationalize bank... is it possible interest rate may be decrease ... 6% to 9% is ok....

0 0 Recently Govt has widened the tax payers net by retaining basic slab as Rs.250000/- and increased rebate of Rs.5000/- now, discussions/debates regarding increasing the slab for Individual Assessee of Rs. 4,00,000 and lowering tax rate for high income group.  In this connection, my suggestion as follows:  BASIC LIMIT BE INCREASED TO RS.300000/ WITHOUT ANY REBATE  TAX SLAB 3 TO 6 LACS - 7%  6 - 12 LACS - 15%  12 - 20 LACS - 20% ABOVE 20 LACS 30% so as to retain the existing assessees.
0 0 My respected PM, i have an idea of demonezation ,that is ,all money value change as swiping  card formet,the govt. may issue the money as card formet ie. Rs.100card , Rs.500card and Rs.2000 card.moreover the govt. may issue the swiping machine to the all merchanters in low card.kindly withdraw the all type of money and issue the money only swiping card type. so that every thing is accountable. so consider my openion as possibe . thank you. mobile 9944008229
0 0 1. An appeal/concession to all food vendors to move to e-money. The first hurdle for shift of currency is for food. If road side food vendors and small hotels start using electronic money it will inspire/compel others for sure. 2. Cleanliness: I believe Indians want to be clean, but dont know how. If a commodity is consumed, we are not taught as to what to do after consuming(toffee to biryani to flowers to electronics). We must invest time and money for imparting this education.
1 0 Sir To move to cash less economy please implement  following -Place a ceiling limit on cash that can be kept in hand -ask citizens to remit all such cash in hand exceeding the limit to KYC compliant accounts within a prescribed date. -after the prescribed  date, reasons for “cash remittance and cash withdrawals from/to bank accounts beyond said  limits (including cumulative withdrawal/ deposits during a Financial Year)”  to be clarified by proper statements to govt.
0 0 Respected Sir, In my opinion Government offices should do way with the landline phones now as they are almost becoming obsolete besides being misused. Mobile phones can serve the purpose. A lot of money which is spent for paying landline bills in govt offices can be saved.
2 0 Dear sir,  so many shops accept debit or credit cards only when the amount is more than rs 250. A common his income may not be buying for that  amount. Debit card is as good as paying cash.So may I request that shop keepers must made to accept debit cards even for 20 rupees.Under the present context this will help the common man a lot and he will go for a debit card

In case some one missed cheque leaf/Enemy took the cheque book ,they are doing the blackmailing . if we give complaint and filed as FIR also . It wont work, because we need to go to Court and need to prove that its false case ( we didnt  gave  to x party). unnecessary struggle . This is kind of harassment . this is happened for me .

Thanks
0 0 Dear Modiji, Government can think of offering Insurance to the 'Cattle' of Farmers if they come and get a new Jan Dhan Savings account and get a debit card for their use. This way, I think farmers who are still not in the main stream will join the digital movement. By this we will be able to support the cashless drive in rural/remote places as well. Thank you, Namaskar
0 0 Respected PMO, please bring the proposed house scheme for the middle class.
0 0 Respected Sir, This is for your kind information that income tax for individuals are promptly filing their returns with necessary documents. Wherein as a common query is that why Advocates are exempted from the taxation. Why Advocates are not showing their income sources to income tax, Advocates fees always at high and in advance they collect more but they don't work in the interest of justice and equity to support justice. Their business to make money instead of helping common man.

0 0 Dear Modi Ji & Team, have few thoughts,... 1. I am sorry, never able to understand the reason for introducing 2000 Rs denomination when we are trying to kill black money out of demonetisation... should we introduce 100, 200, 300, 400 Rs notes instead of higher denominations... 2. we know the dangers of fertilizer & world nations are banning indian veg-fruits, can Govt put a ban over fertilizer and go back to our tradition which is now called organic farming. we can be a leader in this

0 0 Sir, why 50-50 option for Black Money holders? As they have done what Family Planning Ministry cannot do? Corrupt Doctors had killed many due to wrong/lengthy /expensive treatment, Corrupt Engineers/Contractors had killed many by Poor Construction, Corrupt Police/Lawyers had freed Murderers, Corrupt officials had appointed wrong Persons causing many Accidents.

0 0 Dear Narendra Modi Ji. I think that the hacking issue of the online payment apps like Paytm is done by those who have black money to fail the Cashless Economy act of India. I thint this because there were no hacking issues of the online payment apps before the Cashless Economy started even if the transactions were going on. This is done to make fear in the mind of the people and to stop them from paying online and keep using notes. I requeast you to take some action against this issue.Thank you.
1 0 Dear Sir I have a small idea about the Corporation people who is involved in Black money exchange. Take there passport,Adhar Card size there Bank accounts,there wife , children's and there property ext and let them block for 10years and make them free. Where know one should give job, he can't go out of country and they shoukd work for government job which is paid low salary. They should work for next 5 years and show there honestly and faith to our country , then they can be set free.

1 0 The Income Tax Department has done wonderful job by publishing an "Email ID" for informing about black money hoarders.  Similarly the Home Ministry must also have an open "Email ID" for receiving information on security issues, terrorists, anti national activities in the visinity.  Presently there is no system available for the common citizen to inform.
1 0 Hi, This is regarding the tag line that is visible on every train ticket we purchase now a days. It is good to know and should be printed to create awareness. At the same time, we have Suvidha trains where we pay hefty charges for the same trip. More painful is that even if there are many vacant seats available, we end up paying more than double the charge.....Railway as a whole needs a revamp within!!! There are many areas within Railway where cost cutting steps are imperative at this stage...

0 0 Namaste Sir, Please do something to address the reservation category (FC, BC, SC, ST, etc.) and casteism at least in the education sector. Sometimes this fractures the mindset of children. Young generations like us though open-minded are forced to take decisions due to casteism and societal impact. Let's not force division among children in the name of casteism that will ruin our country's future.
0 0 please impose reservation based on financial constraints not on castism. Save bengal from the communal attacks & mamta banerjee.

Please announce 100% digital payment mandatory now from 1 March 2017 in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai.  No cash allowed and people will be prepared by then.

0 0 Resp. Sir, Saadar Pranam! Propose the 10 topical issues for this month’s episode of Mann Ki Baat in the enclosed PDF file. Regards & Jai Hind....!
0 0 1) As far as traffic problems are day by day increasing,there should be two shift working  in Govt. department. 2) There should be different timings for different  establishments. 3) There should be one window system for paper movement.For your work if any you have to submit papers on one table only.There should be no requirement to visit  in diiferent offices.
0 0 It is good to have provisions for the needy in constitution but caste based provisions are to checked again.because the person who get a job can make his children study more than him.he can make his children a doctor, a engineer etc but what if they have got them due to reservation,we will be developing their family status by stepping on the lives of the people who have better qualifications than them Actually caste system is a constitutional provision till u dont reform it this can't eliminatd
0 0 Our respected PM Ji Kindly speak about time plan for dispensing  with anonymous donations of any amount.These be accepted only through banking channels.And monthly income and expenditure statement should  required to be filed by  every political party with election commission and put on its website for dissemination for citizens which will facilitate to cement your image as great statesman ever produced by country so as to implement demonetization effectively and to promote less cash society
0 0 1)For boosting cashless system,there should not be any financial burden on card holder and also on shop or service provider to whom he pays. 2) Those who are doing illegal actions,Govt.should take immediate action and release that good money in market. 3) There is huge difference between employee provident pension scheme and jumbo pension amount of Govt.employees. 4)When there shall be stoppage in working of session in parliament,there should be no a facilities for members for that  period.
0 0 Hi,just wd like to share my thoughts in the interest of Nation's economy and convince of common people.

And you should encourage everyone to conduct political rallies via VC.
1 0 In respect to Mann Ki Baat December 2016, I want to suggest that, the ordinance in respect to wages payment to labour by cheque or by banking channel is welcome, the benifit of such schmes to labour should be explained, further, labour working at small traders and at farm, for which clarification should be given, so ,opposition cannot mislead them,further,such labour should be joint with health insurace E.S.I.mandatory, will get all medical facilities to family members of labour, best wishes
1 0 Sir, It would be great, if all RTO's of motorvehicle department were centralised, followed by issue of IND Registration rather than individual states (KL-Kerala, TN-Tamilnadu, UP-Uttarpradesh) and numbers suffixing IND may be used to indicate the state. This would make road tax collection centralised, with permission to use the vehicle anywhere in India. This would make digitization easier, rather than stressing for digitisation in individual states.

0 0 Hi,sir I think most of the changes you have bought forward are really good.But those can be welcomed by everyone only after knowing the outcomes of before taking a step please educate the up to possible extent For example when you ask every ration card holder to submit there actual financial details they would fear that they may deprived of their provisions but when most of the people are willing and do it,can lead to changes in ecomic lines and new system righteous people won't loose it
0 0 I am an Indian studying abroad. I would like to bring to your kind notice that around hundred thousands of Indian students are studying abroad and almost 50% of them are likely to be willing to come back to India to get settled. But in turn, the government is not very interested in inviting them back. Some such initiatives like "Ramalingaswami Re-entry fellows" has only 50 seats!!! I don't say that whoever study abroad are best. But against hundred thousand students, you choose just 50??

0 0 Respected sir ,Pranam. I am putting my views on cashless health system for the poor and lower middle class who are unable to give high premiums to insurance companies and bills to hospitals.ESIC is the perfect model for masses as it is promoting cashless facilities and digitalisation as well, but it is available to certain set of people .It should be made available to masses as it can fullfill the dream of sarvey santu niramaya theme with cashless and digital system of health facilities.

We do have election commission website but it takes months and months to get any action on application. Requesting for your attention on this please.

It will also result in controlling the crime.

1 0 even as anonymous  whistle blowers in order to track and bring the corrupt to book. I suggest this for Your Honour’s kind perusal since this could instill a sense of fear, shame and guilt in the minds of the family members and also the public servant or politician, which may in the long run have some effect in reducing corruption and also empower and embolden the hardworking, straightforward but shy people to come out and report about the various corruptions and hoarded wealth.
0 0 After  demonetization when a largest group of people is going  to make payments  electronically,  Can we  make/use/popular  a Term for All electronic modes of payment  (atleast in Government system)  like as:  example- “etm”- (Electronic transaction Mode/method)   ;  “epm”-(Electronic Payment Mode/method)” ;   “eps”-(Electronically Payment System)  ;     “ets Electronic transaction system) .. ……  etc................

Your Honour could address the family members to live within their means and to increase their means of income according to their abilities and hardwork and not latch upon the corrupt person and his bribe monies to support their false and pretentious life style. Your Honour could also address the honest public servants who are in know of corruption / benami transactions / benamis etc to report it (contd)
0 0 who receive bribes and use it for luxuries or vices, and that it is the ardent responsibility of the family members to address the issue of corruption and bribe money since most of the corrupt persons would cite their family members lifestyle and their requirements as an excuse for their corrupt ways and means. Your Honour could state that the family members of such public servants or politicians have a national duty and honour to keep a clean life and be above suspicion (contd)
0 0 leads to worse living conditions, loss of livelihood and even loss of life and thus the corrupt money is nothing but blood money and there is nothing to rejoice in the good life provided by bribe money.  Emphasize could be laid on the stigma that the  family of such corrupt persons would face when caught by the long arms of law. Your Honour could address the family members straight saying that the family members should protest and detest the public servant or politician or others (contd)
0 0 Namste SIR, Thank you so much for everything you are doing for INDIA. I wanted to give suggestion on Food prepared in restaurants.Food they prepare on daily basis is having daily wastage for sure.I don't know what they do with it,throw it off or use it on next day.But if they do a practice of giving it away this remaining food(not the one which is left out on the table from guests) for free everyday to poor people,it'll be a great help for the very poor people around.

0 0 In such competitive times, govt of INDIA should also recruit top class graduates from institutes like the IIM's, IIT's etc. These graduates should be used by government in its various functions like the way it deploys an IAS.

0 0 In order to improve the digital security at ATM's, POS machines etc, govt can install additional layer of security by registering the biometrics of the transacting person.

1 0 Respected PM One suggestion for all Maritime vessel's. All Marine vessel's should run on LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas). As off now Cars and Railway Locomotive runs on LPG, on similar grounds all Marine vessels and Marine Troller's must run on LPG instead of Diesel. This will help to reduce Pollution.

In this way the target can be achieved in a desired time frame.

At present post offices demand cash for sending money order.

This will help us to bring electric transportation (For e.g. Tesla car).
0 0 Mr. Modi, While going through with some researches on Internet for waste management, I watched a video on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTV6f853IZE) on how Sweden has become the world leader in transforming waste into energy. 3 ton of waste is equivalent to the energy produced by 1 ton of fuel/oil. They have made commodity out waste, importing 800 tons of waste from outside. Having said that waste incineration causes a lot of carbon emissions, however is one of the best ways.

The law shall only enforce the uniform minimum wages throughout the country and EPF/ESI should be a responsibilty of employee.

0 0 Mr. PM, For replacing old currency, I am just thinking if we could have planned better by rolling out a single software application across all banks throughout the country to capture the details like PAN/Aadhar and the amount while submitting old currency notes for replacement.

I only need to deposit Rs. 6000 that too is my first deposit. I fully support this new rule but not happy with the implementation. Thanks, Jai Hind.

0 0 Sir, I totally support your action towards demonetization. I suggest a total cashless system at petrol pumps/ oil outlets for sale of petro-products. Every consumer i.e. vehicles/generators/pumpsets/industry should have a petrocard linked with bank a/c. It should be mandatory that sale of petro-products is 100% cashless. This move will result in less pollution & regulated consumption linked with accountable expenditure on oil resulting in stopping corrupt practices in petro industry.
0 0 Respected Prime Minister Sir, I fully support demonetization and appreciate this courageous decision taken by your government. Though situation is slowly improving but still long way to go (no Rs. 500 note, cash for veg/fruits/milk/bus/auto). Please talk about the actual benefits realized by Demonetization (amount of black money caught, additional income for government, new schemes) so far and when will the situation be normal? Thanks, Jai Hind.

0 0 Respected sir, The civil unrest in J&K can only be fought by enhancing people to people contact. The young generation had never been out of the state and get wrong impression of India from social media.

0 0 Corruption at lower level a big problem for general public and traders and small businessman. My suggestion is to have a) district/panchayat level watch dog under jan lokpal/ACB equipped with latest secrete audio/video capturing equipment’s to capture and provide online info to central team to take immediate action.  b) People should be awarded for not paying bribe and to provide evidence against corrupt officials. Public involvement/support would eradicate corruption.

0 0 Respected sir, In our patriarchal system women employment is disliked. In the case of death of husband(bread-earner) families come to a grinding halt. We should make provision to provide job to the wife/kin of deceased person in both govt & private sector, in accordance to their qualification. The companies should be allowed to pay the salary from their CSR (2% ) obligation for the first few years. This way we can save families from economic uncertainties and social evils.

This single step can boost women employment & can reduce fake experience.

0 0 Sir, May I suggest that every transaction for rs 5000 & and above must be made  card or electronic. Upi platform is good. Iam popularising to the possible extent.*99# platform should be made perfect and easy so that common man will not feel the problem due to cash crunch.
0 0 Dear Modi ji, I would like to want your concern for private schools,  the way they operating . Every year the administration changes their course-book and it is unnecessary economic burden for parents, if they have successor child.  My matter of concern that not to change books for at least five years of intervals. And if it is really necessary to change course-book then there should be a system (library) whete old book could be deposited for economic-weaker section or society in free of cost.
1 0 Sir, I have been trying to use *99# for trf money. In last 2 weeks I have succeeded onlytwice.It always shows 'connection problem 'from this morning it shows temtemporarily service not available.

1 0 people have to face corruption at low level like Patwari, Municipality, Lower Level Judiciary, Police. they have to pay a small amount (Rs. 500-1000) as bribe to make complete their work. every office should have citizen charter for completion of work. There should be due time for completion of any work. All offices must have complaint/suggestion box/register.
0 0 Sir, everyone must be given financial literacy.It should start from school level itself.  Now, even a college graduate does not know that he has to  pay tax.He does not know how to write a cheque also. Both theory and practical training should be given for cashless transaction atleast in high school level. Finance management , different options of savings, insurance, mutual funds , different taxes to be paid, types of loans etc. should be part of the curriculum.
0 0 sir please do away with the subjective exam system in this country and make  all the exams objective as subjective exams involve a lot of judgement on the part of the checker and different checkers may have different views regarding the same answer and thus an element of subjectivity and luck creeps in and you dont want to leave the future of the coountry on luck
1 0 make Payment of fees in college by digital concentrate on ISSUE of Income Certificate and link with bank data to avoid the duplicate and link SSLC,HSC AND DEGREE with adhaar and display in marksheets, Degree certificates,Community Certificates, Verify the allotted quota for each Course in colleges and match with scholarship before crediting the amount to colleges maintain CCTV in class room, canteen and pathway and entire college campus and hostel for women security and avoid raging.
3 0 the government should also do cashless transactions and in star hotels the sales tax and service tax are added to the customers bill. this makes people in a confused state that whether the people in hotel do sales or service. so these taxes should be cut down. and a common tax should be imposed. as an addition government should make a clean amendment about the tax details.
1 0 My Suggestion to Income Tax Slab upto 2 lakh - No tax or flat ₹ 1000 >2 to 4 lakh - flat ₹ 2000 per lakh >4 to 10 lakh - 10 % >10 to 20 lakh - 20 % >20 lakh - 30 % exemption under 80c, 80d ond others to continue.
1 0 Dear Sir, My suggestion towards digital India, Pl.ask commerce ministry to issue circular making mandate to have POS M/cs while registering Establishments( viz., small shops,eateries, Hotels, pan shops, grocery shops/Industries. Though the subject may be State perview, initiate from central is always needed. On 19th we visited Shiridi, it is observed that eatery section of Hotel does not accept Card but lodging section has POS. Still People wants to hoard cash.
1 0 each and every political party donation should be cashless and there should be elections only 1 time in 5 years of both centre and state.
0 0 But now old currency is demonetized, we should move forward, take steps first in government institutions. Any government institute should not pay or receive money more than Rs. 500 in cash. this rule was already in GFR but Head of Offices violated this this rule. Not this rule should be followed strictly.
0 0 Dear sir I just want to suggest a very simple step to bring in one of the most unaccounted section of economy i.e. "Private Tutions" to mainstream economy. Please give a rebate on income tax to taxpayers if they submit a verified tution reciept for their wards. Every month parents spend almost same amount of money as their school fees on private tutions. The numbers become more for students facing board examinations. Most of the private tutors deals in cash so it remain unaccounted.
0 0 Dear Honourable Prime Minister. Sir, I have a suggestion. Why not we make 'VAAN MAHA UTSAV' a national festival. As today's pollution is getting higher and higher, I strongly believe that this is also a need of the hour. Organisation planting trees will not be enough. Every Citizen should "Plant A Tree A Year". And I am sure everyone will come forward. We have to bring it into practice and the government should promote this festival by supplying saplings, identifying place to plant the tree etc.
0 0 due to demonetization farmers' produce now become cheaper, they have to sell their products on throw away prices. whether is it good for economy? people don't know how to pay online. they don't know mobile wallets, online banking, payment apps! even internet prices are very high. for this there is need of Smart Phone but they don't have this! there is also risk of cyber theft, phishing, our IT security is not so full proof. whether any institution will take guarantee for their money?
1 0 Namaste :) I am proud of you Sir ! Please find 6 new additions to few suggestions I had previously given in attached PDF. Hope thoughts will be inline and may contribute to movement of INIDA RISING !!!
1 0 It is the saddest thing in our country that farmers do not get paid for the effort they put at field for the crops/veggies etc. Of Rs. 20 which we pay to sabjiwala, farmer's % is at max Rs. 5 and rest Rs. 10 is middleman (mandiwala's) and Rs.5 shopkeeper. Of those mandiwala's are the one making the most out of it. I would request government to setup a government buying mandi in every state and ensure that 50% of retail veggies price goes to the poor farmer and mandiwala and shopowner 25% each.

0 0 Use of discharge water from RO: Almost every household in cities use now-a-days small RO system. The most efficient RO system work on principle of 5:1 ratio - 1 L of potable water after wasting 5 L of supply water. Such as large amount of water can be stored and used for washing (floor, cloths)... Once the water charges are fixed as per amount of water consumed, people will start adopting water saving techniques instead of wasting this "most important" resource.
1 0 My idea is about segregation of household waste: enforce and promote separate storage of bio-degradable and recyclable household waste in separate containers. The RWA and other society should provide necessary bins for garbage collector to store the items separtely. This will improve working conditions of garbage picker & all chains downstream will benefit. For example, I store plastic in separate bins but when I handover it to the garbage collector, he puts it along with bio-degradable wastes.

1 0 Inline with the govt initiatives to increase the penetration of digitalization in rural as well as rest of India. It is expected that the various institutions such as educational, judiciary, district administration, panchayats should encourage acceptance & disbursal of money through digital mode. In order to encourage the same various discounts/ incentives needs to be put in place. Also, Payment / disbursal of cash needs to be discouraged and various additional charges needs to imposed.

0 0 PM Ji, Large capital into banks is causing savings interest rates to fall significantly lower. Many retired and salaried middle class largely depend on deposit interest. Request the government to initiate scheme to collect deposits using postoffice and mudra bank at attractive interest rates than banks and lend directly to MSME in rural/urban areas. People suffered losses in the past by investing in fraudulent finance companies and unethical co-operative banks in the past when interest was lower

1 0 I really Appreciate the step of removing Gas Subsidies from the people paying tax. Similarly the caste system should also be taken under control. People who have taken reservation and are at good positions and earning a fortune, should be removed from reservation system. In this way only financial deserving people will get benefits of reservation. People should understand that it is not  caste that make them reserved category but the financial condition. This will help in improving the talent.
0 0 Dear Prime Minister @ #MannKiBaat, Demonetize Scheme started by you is a real game changer initiative. For the past 60 years, nobody had taken such a strong decision.  Also the move for Less Cash usage is a great one.  I would like to mention that I opened an online Account in Year 1999 (in last century !!!) and all these 17 years have never done a cash transaction through it.  I feel it is a sort of Record that can even come in GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS.  Regards Anurag Krishna Delhi

This will remove that middle man or agent problem. People will learn technology anyhow to run their normal household. Even

In this way the people will try to learn technology and will start doing online transaction. Then you can start doing these changes one by one so that people will have time learn and follow. First start with Electricity then Gas  and then Water.

1 0 I think, as conscientious citizens of this country, we should entirely stop paying bribes. We should stop breaking the queue just because we have the cash and power to bribe and there is a bribe taker available. I request the PM to utilize the communication channels available both paid and news to appeal to the inner conscience of our people to stop paying bribes in the future. The PM should splash all media with 'Stop Paying Bribe' messages. This will help curbing the creation of black money.

0 0 Greetings to PM. In the move to making our country cashless economy, we need to give incentive to users opting for digital payments. Still most of the banks including Public sector banks like SBI charging for IMPS mode as well as PoS mode.To Incentivise both customers and merchants we need less charges or nill charges.

Will select few persons each state wise and they will look after the project work and those people will be monitor directly.

0 0 ...Can she travel alone in our Indian streets after dark? No. Regardless of her age, she is treated as a sex machine. Who is to be blamed here? PARENTS -who gave birth to a girl child, GIRL - for dreaming life of her own or WHO ELSE. I agree life is full of challenges but to be denied what you wish for due to your gender is nothing but a CURSE.
0 0 ....Why? Is it due to some animals waiting to hunt her, harass her? Why most conservative families deny her everything - happiness, joy, education, love of her life, career, etc.? She fights to continue studying when she attains puberty, to join college when she finishes school, to choose a career post college, to choose bride of her choice for marriage, etc., Why is she treated as a guest in her own house from birth? HER STRUGGLES FOR EQUALITY CONTINUES TILL THE DAY HER BODY SEES THE GRAVE
0 0 Before registering my views, I skimmed through the recent submissions which talked mostly about corruption and demonetization. But there is a more serious issue that defames our nation internationally. BEING BORN AS A GIRL CHILD IS A CURSE IN MOST INDIAN FAMILIES. There are lots of differences on how a family treats a girl vs. boy child. Right from birth she is denied equality in all aspects of life. She is denied the right to pursue her dream.

0 0 Dear Sir I think we should include personal finance education to our school level curriculum. It will help the young kids to plan their investments at very early stage of their career.  There are plenty of financial tools available in the market, but an ordinary citizen is not aware of these.  I strongly feel that this will help young generation to achieve their goals on time. Thanks & Regards Manish Gautam 9729166447
0 0 Point 1 - Instead of NEW NOTE, we should have RETOUCHED old notes with some identity/color. By this we could have avoided current situation and it could have served the same purpose. Point 2 - For ongoing problems, i strongly think GOVT + RBI should target STATE BY STATE solution. for example - govt should just full fill one state need for 2days and den next state. This will be solve problem in better way and it will allow agencies to do better tracking of ongoing black market issues.

0 0 Your decision of Demonitization is commendable.  PAN no of the applicant is an important tool to catch the offenders. Our income tax department should have some system through which the accounts of one individual linked to an individual are reflected in ITs data base so that it becomes easy to catch no of accounts of a customer. Multiple accounts of customers in bank also lead to money laundering. Datas of CIbil should also reflect no of accounts of customer so that we know the trail of money.

This is my personal experience and you must also be aware that all the bhawans like gujrat bhawan, andhra bhawan etc, have restaurant open for public for very reasonable rates but as our government promoting cashless transactions they are accepting only cash for payment. Sir, please make those restaurants cashless. I hope my idea will be accepted for this version of Mann ki Baat.

1 0 India needs 5000 community colleges that are open to people of all ages and background in order to eradicate illiteracy among 45 crore people and ill-literacy among the rest. Major educational reforms are required. On the contrary, HRD Ministry is re-introducing wasteful exams in schools. Educational reforms must be the next big move after demonitization to de-colonize the mind. Changes to the structure of the government is also required.

0 0 Road safety. Sir most of the accidents happen due to no self discipline careless attitude on the road with a 'tera baap ka hai kya' attitude.

Don't allow stopping / parking in 200 meters radius of any major cross road 2. Reclaim footpaths. exemplary penalty 3. Penalty shud b % of vehicle price.

0 0 Please amend the section 13A of IT Act which allows anonymous cash donations below 20k. Political parties take it as an advantage and deposit their leaders black money by showing multiple donations below 20k. People felt cheated by knowing this loophole. This should have been corrected before demonetisation. Pls do this otherwise UP elections will be negative for BJP and PM credibility is going down.
0 0 Why transaction charges are being applicable on using debit card. As its totally similar to using cash. So I recommend to have no charges on using debit card any where for digital transaction. This will definitely show that we are promoting cash less transaction and people will come ahead to use it... Its India and we are not interested to pay single penny in extra to use such digital transaction. And by using debit card it must be totally similar to use cash then only people will come ahead.
