1 0 Shri Narendrabhai, Diwali has lost its charm due to many cultural invasions. A festival where Hindu Calendar year ends. Many formalities were attached with these days as it was year ending for markets and New year for all. March ending system brought chopda pujan to a mockery and tight school vacation holidays forced many parents to fly away from families for leisure trips rather than being with the family members and relatives to really celebrate the festival. some strategic approach can mak

How will you deal with Pakistan for final time
0 0 Respected Modi Sir,I feel that today we need smart villages if we want to improve lifestyle of 70 percent people.I feel that some of gov industries or private industries should be mobilised or erected in rural areas.also technical edu institutions should be made in rural areas to improve employment rates.
0 0 I want to suggest my Hon'ble Prime Minister to start Pension to all Government Employees as it was previously
0 0 Dear PM sir, you and your team is really an inspiration for all of us. Please give some ways of implementing waste management system in city. Specially now a days youth wants to apply in their respective areas but not able to do because of lakh of awareness.
1 0 I have a suggestion towards my Prime Minister and other concerned authorities. This suggestion is regarding our Republic Day. At the first look, it may seem to be a bit absurd and a change to big to be introduced, but I am sure a little introspection will reveal the true power of this suggestion. Please see the attachment for the full suggestion.
1 0 Dear PM, of all the initiatives that you and your team has taken, I appreciate the initiative of making all public transport and facilities handicap friendly. Great thought, but I don't see any great movement in that direction. While I understand and also acknowledge that it is difficult as our country is wide, but it can be made as csr activity for giant corporates, so that the thought can be materialised faster. Once again sirji it's a great thought. Let's join hands to make thier lives easier
0 0 Something need to be changed in our Education system, nowadays all universities are focusing on how to get more marks or how to topped in exam rather than practical experience,so there are so much to discuss.
0 0 Our Khadi bhandar in Mumbai Churchgate is quite big but the products available are slightly boring and monotonous in nature. Can we make use of space properly and have counters of each state Khadi products available under one roof year round. It would be nice to have products available under one roof. Ever since you started promoting khadi more and more people are showing interest. This will help generate higher revenues too. Also if you could send personal letters to all designers to use khadi
2 0 Dear Prime Minister Ji Failure to Cleanliness, One of the reason there is no Place to put garbage even if there is no body is responsible for removing on daily basis. I have a idea that under Manrega if we provide dust bins - half cut plastic drums & through RWA & other association make drive to tell people to put garbage there only & display the name of contractor who is responsible to clear. Authorities are not taking responsibility make cleaning as their objective in ACR.
0 0 Salute to our great Indian soldiers. This Diwali may offer  the ultimate power to destroy terrorists fully. We all Indian are with you. Let's celebrate this with great joy and happiness always. Jay Hind!

0 0 So many countries developed but still all are saying India is developing country, how much time it takes to become developed country  ? Small countries providing employment to other country's students, but in country so much unemployment, reason  ?
0 0 Respected Sir, till now in our country so many villages without roads and electricity what the representatives doing  ?
0 0 Sir, on DIWALI most of the employes get some gift from employer. But some employee like rickshaw wala, sabji wala, Kisan , and many such people don't get  gift from their employer (which is normal public). It would be great if people who went to buy sabji , use rickshaw etc. Give some good wishes or gift to those people also because most of us not recognise that actually we are the employer for such people. So we can bring some happiness to their face. Jai Hind
0 0 water Washing also does not ensure cleanliness of big areas but results in considerable inconvenience to users and leads to wastage of water. Such practice of sweeping and large scale washing is not seen in any other country. They do only picking up of garbage and vacuum clean dust to the extent needed. It is my suggestion that same should be resorted to by an order to all the agencies employed in cleanliness of public premises.Also mopping of large ares should be done instead of water washing.
0 0 resp sir, happy diwali and new year, can we make portal for online donation to any funds of government of india; like sena welfare fund or pradhanmanry relief fund or all other government donation fund on one platform; even any one can donate rs-1 also on festival like diwali,dasherra, christmas, or so on; there should be donation outlet in all banks,postoffice or government office or to private place like ATM to withdraw money; can we make ATM like station for online donation to government fund
0 0 Why is govt. not planning to setup IT hubs in small places like Jharkhand and Lucknow .Why we have all the IT companies concentrated in South Indian cities like Bangalore and Chennai. Because of this there is heavy migration of North Indians in South India and there are issues like Traffic Jam . Narendra Modiji promised that there were be development all over but why is Eastern states of India lagging behind.What steps are govt. taking to enhance IT in Eastern States like Bihar, Jharkhand  Assam
0 0 Sir Happy Diwali & Saal Mubaarak. કેમ છો? I think sir We have to work hard on our education system. I can say every well settled person should take minimum 3 children responsibility to guide them or explain abt importance of education or financial help. It helps  India to educate more people. You share this with every Indian on #mannkibaat Regards, Rajdeepsinh Jadeja
0 0 Keeping the roads and public premises clean remainsa a challenge despite various methods being tried. One of the problems being faced in our style of keeping the public premises and road sides clean is that we resort to sweeping instead of picking up the garbage. Such large scale dry sweeping leads to shifting of part or entire garbage from one location to another location and also leads to considerable air pollution during sweeping. Washing is another practice which does not ensure cleanliness
0 0 Respected Sir .

Our Soldiers of India are great.
0 0 Our Soldier's of great India are great who are securing our life from the terrorists. At present it is also very alarming is to protect daughters of our country who are facing criminals and did not getting any help from any place and local judicial systems and local police helping goons to behave wild and inhuman. Hence, humans having real wish to do good for others are need to be build up in the society. So help us. Thanking you with most humbly.

0 0 Respected PM, I think each and every person and home should be aware of the country in which they live. For that, a fund should be raised by Indians in which every person will contribute rs 1 every day and the fund should be given to the family martyred soldier. This will lead to awareness about sacrifice of solfiers and increase respect towards nation every day. And every small and big person can contribute to this national movement.
0 0 Deer PM, while watching your Diwali message to our soldiers, one idea came to my mind which I thought was worth sharing. The idea is can we not donate one rupee each to the family of our soldiers who have sacrificed their life in protecting the honor of our nation. I am sure people wont have any problem in contributing such a small amount (50p or 1re) for such a great cause.
1 0 Very Important Note for our PM & FM. Home Loan benefit in Income tax  should be given for only one Flat per individual. Its is like everyone keeps on buying the property for getting the income tax benefits & unnecessarily increase the cost of properties & it becomes very difficult for the lay man who cant afford the small home due to high prices.
0 0 On poor quality roads.. Why cannot municipality award the contracts for roads for 5 yrs period to various contractors like we do for housing society building painting ? Upkeeping those roads from all aspects like fining for parking in no-park zone, fining for littering, digging approval and repair, lighting maintenance, etc. Display the map of contractor of each road on website. Display contractor's name on poorly maintained roads to make his / her name shame while citizens pass that road.
0 0 Sir, Currently there is lack of respect for traffic rules which is leading to congestion on the roads,  a number of accidents and unfortunate loss of lives. Please mention in your "Mann Ki Baat" about the importance of following traffic rules which will hopefully bring about the much needed change in mindset among the people towards following traffic rules at all times and all situations.
1 0 Sir, There is urgent need for revamp in education system in India. In my opinion, there should be one courses of study all over India starting from Standard-VIII to Plus2 level with one Board conducting the examinations. No State Boards or separate courses of study for different states. It will help the students all over India to have a standard education at par. There should not be ICSE, CBSE etc. Only one i.e. NCERT to conduct the whole process.
0 0 Respected sir,I request you to say something about opening some platform for speakers or the students who have the passion of becoming professor at higher level.
0 0 Hon PM This man ki baat we wish you to address the justice to all Judicial reforms, security and safety to common people- Role of state police,and request government officials to implement and deliver to people on well thought schemes launched by you namely swachch bharat, clean ganga, make in India and digital india etc.
0 0 Sir, I request you to please say something about making a pollution free diwali, green diwali, eco- friendly diwali. People shouldn't buy unnecessary things, instead they can donate necessary things to the needy people. Also people should not waste electricity in fancy lighting. I suggest instead of burning crackers on Diwali, each person should plant a tree and take care of it. Happly Diwali Sirji #MannKiBaat, #MyGov, #AIR, #PMOnRadio #Diwali

1 0 Respected PM, Please initiate some steps on the old reservation system. Many of like me, becoming useless even having talent in Academic/Technical.

Can we change reservation on the merits of economic status in place of caste basis.

0 0 Namaskar. I have been perturbed by seeing the situation at most of the primary and higher secondary schools where either we do not have good and dedicated teachers (which we used to see when we were kids) or lack of interest on the students itself. I have a suggestion which may improve the situation and bring interests among teachers and students. I propose that it should be made mandatory to Millions of researchers like me to teach at the schools and that must be linked with their ACRs.Thank u.
0 0 Respected Sir, like our Jawans And Kisans our Tribals are real Heros for Forest and Bio diversity Conservation.Their age old traditional practices for soil conservation, water conservation and Forest Conservation are unique in nature and also followed by professionally trained Foresters.

0 0 sir, Now days, nobody is talking about dowry. perhaps they are thinking that dowry has ended to a great extent. i want to point out (in my opinion), dowry increases day to day. it is very disappointing that educated people escalate it. If a person has good govt. job then he take 15-30lakh rupees as dowry that means good job has directly proportional to big amount.

1 0 Dear Modi Ji, I want to point out a big problem due to 100 days employment to rural people. * People who works in this scheme says, "We are getting Rs.140 or something without working properly per day. In that situation why we should work properly and get money" * As a result of this, not only the public money is wasted, it creates a wrong mentality to people. * people lacks the worth of money and leads to severe in disciplinary activities. Please consider my message ASAP. #AIR, #PMOnRadio
0 0 People should recognise as an Indian not by which state they are belong to.For example if someone is from Bihar then call him Bhartiya instead of Bihari and so on.This will create uniteness as well as Constitution also said to not discriminate on basis of region. Specially this will give respect for our N-E states brother and sister
1 0 If many Indian villages had main stream courses set up like mbbs ,bcomm ,or the courses which inspire them to build or invent and export and such which can lead them to be the person they want to be . Electricity , water available . And funds for these courses by government based on the salary of the parents . Our culture is rich , basically we need development of villages to develop India. Make all villages self sufficient. It will save major cities from burden of overpopulation also .

Lots of Candidates preparing for civil services exam & army get rejected due to colour blindness.while it is not defined as a disability in India ,so people don't get any protection from govt.

0 0 Dear Modi Ji, I am supporter of Swachha Bharat Mission. Need to encourage private sector for waste collection and power generation from waste. Nexus of municipalities are not allowing to make this happen. Need to formulate a policy at center level to motivate the private company.

0 0 Dear Sir,I have a suggestion to reduce the pollution. Use of bicycle should be encouraged among all employees in all sectors. Now a days a good bicycle is coming in Rs. 15-20 thousand. This can be funded by 0% interest loan with easy EMI. In spite of your best effort, corruption is still the greatest concern of this country.  There is no mechanism to check foreign visits, gifts, illegal money, awards and many more such incentives. An expiry date can be placed on currency.

0 0 Dear Prime Minister Sir, I Sandeep Agarwal, an IT professional from Mumbai have something to chip in for software fraternity. In IT sector we as a nation is recognized as a service nation and not as a product based nation. Most of the IT products are developed by western countries, though they use our brains to create. Wouldn't be a great idea if the government provides subsidies and tax discounts to companies who invest money for product related activities. This step will encourage companies
0 0 Sir, incidences of animal cruelty are increasing in India. Madam Maneka Gandhi is doing a wonderful job helping animals, I congratulate her. Your opinion matters to innumerable Indians. Please include this in Mann ki Baat. Target the youth and children, many people shall follow your advice. Animals are used for food, clothes, accessories but denied the right to pain- and hunger-free existence. Are they not a part of India? Fear promotes cruelty. Ask parents to teach children to love animals.

0 0 Dogs are human being's best friend.  Diwali is the festival of light and happiness which is often a nightmare for our best friend. Children often find it amusing to tie crackers or more specifically 'ladi' which depresses and harasses dogs and cats. This Diwali lets pledge to altleast reduce the bursting of heavy noice creating crackers so to bring happiness everywhere. I request Honourable prime minister Narendra Modi to address this issue and request fellow citizens to stop abuse of animals.
0 0 IAS, Police & other government positions have entrance exam. But there are many critical positions which do not have entrance exam which can test candidates capabilities to handle the position in best way with complete ethics & values. I want to suggest that if anyone wanting to have any position in government office, there should be entrance exam. The entrance exam should test skills as well ethics* & values* of the candidate. This way governance quality can be improved.

2 0 Dear Modi sir Congratulations for Good Government, you are doing wonderful Job. Sir you have already taken measures to curb black money that's great but my suggestion to encourage more people to pay tax is to start some incentive policy for existing taxpayers from last 5-7 years. This will not only encourage newer people for paying more taxes but also boost existing taxpayers. Modi Sir as we are talking of young India, and let me tell you 1 thing that Young India is not poor India. Jai Hind🙏🙏
1 0 Respected Sir As our country is becoming more and more populous day by day. Unless we control our population our all plan and schemes are utilized efficiently.

0 0 We must look into our education system deeply. The school system does not encourage students to ask - it's about teachers to tell. It kills the curiousity and also does not make them self-responsible. So Indian work force doesn't have a great reputation abroad. Indians are known to shirk work, and this comes from years of working only for marks and not foryourself. In the end our students are quite different from students in US and other advanced nations. #MannKiBaat, #MyGov, #AIR, #PMOnRadio
0 0 I wish a happy& prosperous Diwali to you and your Govt.which has worked very well inspite of all odds&opposition.Certain unique works had been done in the interest of the people like Divyang welfare,Ujjawala yojna,reformsin Railway& telecom sector etc.but more gaps are to be filled in Swacchata mission so that taxpayers money does'nt go waste and the killer diseases like Dengue,chickengunia viral fever,Malaria etc.

Unless the PAN Card copy is submitted the tenant cannot claim the HRA while the owner enjoys the rent and cheats the Govt. Earlier we could claim the HRA by giving an undertaking from the Owner. The Govt should provide an alternative on how the HRA can be claimed in this situation and also provide a forum where such owners can be reported. Regards Yogesh

I am extremely supportive of this idea and if i were to ever rent my house i would give the PAN card copy to the tenant. However in reality not all Owners this the same to the extent they don't want to show this

0 0 1. The Haryana growth is limited and against your "make in India" mission due to the "Khirki Daula toll" in Gurugram, Haryana. The toll should be removed cos due to this the investers are reluctant to cross the toll and invest in Manesar, Pachgaon, Dharuhera, Rewari, Bawal belt. Why cant Haryana govt pay 350 Cr, remove KD toll and open the gates for huge investment on GGn-Bawal (DMIC) belt. I think PMO needs to lead KD Toll removal and guide the state govt, help them.

2 0 Sir, I am impressed with your initiatives. Development is good but rather than commenting on development I would give emphasis on women's safety. This has become extremely important. Its hard to give safety to each and individual girl / women of India,but we will should come up with mandatory self-safety training for girls and harsher and faster punishment for criminals.Crime against women are rising everyday. India is our motherland and let us all commit to protect our mothers and sisters.

0 0 Respected Prime Minister, I heartly feel that Government should fix a criteria for fighting the elections. I think that a politician must be graduated, no police case in past. And a written test and finally interview. And after all that he can be eligible for fighting the elections. Written test and interviews should be conducted by IAS officers and JUDGES of high court. if you are graduated then you have knowledge and may be less corrupt. But I know that it is not possible.

I would feel highly obliged if you kindly address them directly in your next Man ki baat speech. I request you to include action plans to include Kashmiris into main stream India.

1 0 Namaskar to Sri. Narendara Modi sir, My suggestion to the government of India should start a project which will "Nuclear Sheild the enitre India".  I suggest the name of this project would be called "RAKSHA" (A telugu word which means PROTECTION). If this project completes successfully it will safeguard 1.3 billion people of India from nuclear threat. Now a days we see tensions all over the world especially some countries who are not more responsible in handling their nuclear tests and weapons.
2 0 Respected Prime Minister Sir, I am a student of class 12th and this being my arra of interest urge you to pay forward some attention to it, I wanted to say that, Why only businessman and entrepreneurs are only chased by the income tax raids? Why not the bureaucrats and officials, who have multiple times more money than what businessmen have! And also that even being the highest taxpayers and the one who develops are chased! Rather than people with political background, who only gift backdrops.
0 0 One nation one number There are so many issues like eveteasing, animal accidents, road accidents which goes unnoticed because of so many helpline numbers like 1091, 100 etc which varies from city to city .

That will be real india where people will feel a part of the change.  #MannKiBaat, #MyGov, #AIR,#PMOnRadio

0 0 Dear Respected PM, Wishing you a HAPPY DIWALI. I am sure your positive mindset will take this nation to greater heights. This positive mindset is what I want you to focus for the nation to achieve transformation. Negativism kills benefits. Many tasks need to be accomplished and resolve is required. Similarly people should inculcate 'nek vichaar', spirit of sacrifice and concern for humans which is sadly missing.
0 0 Namaste Modi Ji, I am a native of Bhagalpur, Bihar and I would like to draw your attention towards the extremely lethargic judiciary in our country. A court case has been going on my ancestral home for last 26 yrs. I belong to the 3rd generation who might get sucked into this seemingly never ending court case. My house is in extremely bad shape and needs repairs but due to the on going case we cannot do that. We have suffered too much, I request to do something to speed up the judiciary.

0 0 please share your views about the stray dog menace in the country in next #MannKiBaat, #PMOnRadio. Even though ultimate blame for this problem is the citizens them self, who pollute their surroundings and public space with there solid wastes, especially food leftovers; immediate solution lies in culling of the rabies affected stray dogs. ABC program works as a mid-term or long term solution, but by then many a lives would have been bitten to death by the mauling jaws of the kennel.

But we also need to consider the World Bank ranking and my little advice is kindly make separate committee of all state minister and central ministers(industry wise) which can communicate with world bank or other international authorities, and take necessary step and implement it on national and state level like GST council. It will help to accelerate decision making and making uniform law all over India.

It will ensure better utilization of home guards and will allow the police force to focus on law enforcement.

0 0 Dear Sir, recently Neelam Katara (mother of honour killing victim Nitish Katara) said on a popular news show, that she would like to see a Safe In India campaign first, because one cannot Make In India unless we are safe and free to live a dignified life. The macabre murders of young women in metropolitan cities like Delhi and Chennai only further drive home this point. A nationwide,long term campaign to address the pressing issue of Safety, esp. of Women, must be initiated. #AIR #MannKiBaat
0 0 Modiji, when things are improving on all fronts, can we let our national broadcaster Doordarshan lag behind ? I stay in Singapore and we have access to every major national channel in the world be it US, China, Japan or other countries and we seee how they use their channel to showcase their countries. Can Doordarshan also pull up its socks and present the India story to the world in a much more compelling and convincing way ? Hope the IB ministry will take note of this suggestion.Happy Diwali!
0 0 Dear Modiji, When we speak of valour and selfless service, we miss out on appreciating services of our Fire personnel. Kindly consider bringing the Fire Force/ brigade under NDRF. That will not only give them the due national recognition, it will also help scale up their current skills and morale. Additionally, they will be a force multiplier in disaster situations as their skills/ expertise/ experience can be used at a national level. They will also have a better career progression.
0 0 Principle for being the Sovereign Country:- "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vidyan, Jai Insan" Jai Jawan - To maintain sovereignty, Jai Kisan - To be independent in all means, Jai Vidyan - For the prosperity of Society, Jai Insan - For the betterment of "Vishwa". & to maintain the ethics of the humanity.
0 0 Dear Modiji, 1) Under Swachh Bharat, there should be guidelines issued with respect to disposing of electronic waste, plastic/ polythene products, any other kind of waste that can adversely impact the environment. These guidelines should be included in school & college curriculum. Volunteer groups should be created to bring about awareness in societies, slums, offices, communities & other groups, sanitary workers, etc.
0 0 Dear Modiji, While hoisting our national flag during Independence and Republic day at schools, housing societies, offices, parks, etc, we should "honour" our security personnel/ soldiers by inviting them to hoist the flag instead of local politicians/ school principals/ housing society members. The young impressionable minds of our society will also get to see first-hand the "honour" in selfless service to the nation given by our security personnel/ soldiers.
0 0 Dear Modiji, We pray "Annah data sukhi bhava" before meals, for the wellbeing of our farmer community. We should have a similar prayer for well being of our security personnel/ soldiers. "Raksha Karta sukhi bhava" (or something better), before we retire to bed every night. This is for the well being of our security personnel, irrespective of which uniform they wear i.e. whether from Indian Military/ Indian Police/ NIA/ NDRF/ CBI/ Intelligence agencies or any other security agency).

0 0 . It is reported that large number of goods, drugs, arms and fake currency comes to India from Pakistan via border routes and from India smugglers exchanges materials to Pakistan. And this illegal trade across the border should be stopped forever. And all the Chinese product should be banned in india . As the chinese products are termed to be poor quality products.   Central Government should send an unambiguous message to the china and Pakistan.
0 0 The private vehicles to make easy money run trips everyday by flouting norms. And these vehicles should be seized and be penalized heavily. And these vehicles are recipe for disaster. The traffic police -transport department must come up with definite, concrete and workable solutions to prevent this violations.  Most private vehicles are used for commercial purposes and are overloaded with their prescribed capacity. These violations of vehicles are unchecked.
0 0 There are several issues seen and some of them as also been reported that school van drivers and also private vans and autos carrying school children\'s flout violations in Bangalore is worrysome. Seen especially in Bangalore south. The traffic police a transport department should crackdown these vehicles which flout norms and violations. And these vehicles are not following Apex court directives and principles laid on them for the safety of student.
0 0 .  But the recent report that ACB of the state conducted raids in several places seized cash and documents showing coded diary entires of payoff’s to officials and politicians.  The Central government should look in to this matter of misuse of Aadhaar cards, as its stakes are pretty high, with supreme Court yet to give its consent to make it mandatory document.
0 0 The NDA Government has identified Aadhaar as the single most effective tool to deliver food grins, fertilizers, kerosene and LPG subsidies to target the beneficiaries with minimum leakage.  Most of the Aadhaar card are linked to the ration card across the country.  The State Governments should conduct the investigations on the possible misuses of Aadhaar numbers.
0 0 Fight noise pollution created by unnecessary Horning on the roads. 1.	Counsel all driving schools to inculcate the spirit of “Consideration” to fellow drivers and pedestrians and discourage the need to horn unless faced with a dangerous situation. 2.	Strict instructions may be given to all Government institutions to follow “Horn only if you absolutely must”. Provide incentives to compliant drivers who show the most patience. 3.	Run a campaign on all media, featuring celebrities if necessary

0 0 In this case most of the employees are women who work in deplorable conditions do not have enough leaves and have to toil very hard.  Most of the workers are not payroll and work like labourers.  Most of the women workerers were yet to marry and they have to earn to save for their marriage as they cannot depend on their parents due to the poverty.
0 0 The government should focus on the garment workers and also who works in private company and establishments, getting low salaries and job insecurity of lakhs of workers.  These workers are paid poorly and they also risk in losing their jobs as factories, private companies and establishment often shut down operations without no reasons.  An average worker earn just Rs. 5000/- to 6000/- PM with no benefits other than PF and ESI and gratuity.
0 0 The film maker was made to pay Rs. 5 Cr to an army fund as penance for engaging a Pakistani artist is a worst part of deal.  This amount to a extortion or bribe which criminals take to ensure the running of normal business.  Bringing the army in to this political deal is bad. The claim that the payment was voluntary cannot be believed at all.  It is like the police telling the trader to pay the protection money to the street thug.

0 0 Employer paying less wages to temporary staff at times described as daily wage employees, adhoc appointees,casual & contractual basis & the like is indulging in an act of exploitative enslavement emerging out of a domineering position.As they performs the same duties and responsibilities.It is fallacious to determine artificial parameters to deny fruits of labours.He has to provide food & shelters to his family at the cost of his self respect,dignity,self worth & his integrity.

0 0 I believe you are aware of objections made by Indian Armed Forces in 7th pay commission reports.But I don't understand why there is so much disparity in Soldiers and their civilian counterparts,why they have to fight for what they deserve?The disability pension for an Additional Secretary is Rs70,000 and that of a three-star General only Rs 27,000,it should be SAME ATLEAST.The odds of a man in uniform getting injured is several times more likely than that of the civilian counterpart.

We are facing an uphill task convincing residents to segregate and give waste to primary collection team. We believe if your talks can include this segregation of waste into compostable(bio-degradable), re-cycleable/re-usable and discardable types then the local associations will find it easier to take the message to people.

0 0 Dear Sir One activity that affects every single one of us Indians is agriculture. The state of our farmers continues to remain miserable despite a multitude of measures by successive governments. Agriculture in our country remains highly dependent upon weather elements. The sector remains disorganized with farmer trying to optimize resources from people around for all activities of cultivation, irrigation, monitoring and harvesting. Please encourage a mobile app for pooling of agri resources.

0 0 In our Country no one will get money if he doesn't work.and it will be decided by their Boss or employer we can say. Now the point is Why All MP'S and MLA'S have self certified right to increase their salary by their own and when time came related to increase the salary all parties will agree for salary which is highest. But when it comes to national Interest they divided into different parties and don't run the parliament so why should government not take a stand on "NO WORK NO PAY"#MannKibaat

This will educate students about the importance of recycling thus providing a path to greener future. 2. It help to improve the environment & in dealing with waste. 3. It will give job to the needy people. 4. It is estimated that recycling half the world’s paper would avoid the harvesting of 20 million acres of forestland.

0 0 Respected Sir, a small change could help to create India better. As there is road trafficking almost each and everywhere in India, most of the times when a patient is in critical condition, when he/she need an ambulance, due to heavy road traffic problem the ambulance can't reach to the patient, either the condition became more critical or dead. So at that time we often take the patient in our arrangement, the road remain congested, no one even try to move or give space so that we, contd...

0 0 continuation ..35000+ ppl are visiting tirupati temple but many of them dont know that there is a science musuem in tirupati. Then how will the country progress? In the temple premesis/ busstand/ railway station, this should be painted so that ppl get awareness. Similarly in Vijayawada temple/ railway station also. Liquor/ tobacco production/ sale should be banned fully. Otherwise there is no point in saying on stages about 'honouring women and women upliftment schemes'
0 0 sir please talk about traffic sense and if possible ask parents to not give vehicles to underage kids, my 2nd suggestion is why don't we add a compulsory subject of traffic rules in our curriculum
0 0 नमस्कार / నమస్కారము /ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ/ வணக்கம்/ নমস্কাৰ/ નમસ્તે/ ଶୁଣିବେ/ നമസ്കാരം To increase science temper in our country, the railway station & bus stand TV should be used properly...advertisement about science museum should be shown for 2 min in those Televisions once every 2 hours...in local language(say telugu along with hindi/ samskrutam)...say, Vishweshwarayya museum advertisement should be shown in Bengalooru station. Similarly, things which promote national integrity/innovations by common ppl

0 0 My name is Satya Pavan kumar.I'm a student. Sir, as per my knowledge concern you did a lot to Our COUNTRY.As this is the 25th episode that going to be held, I'd like to stress upon one main thing. Government is releasing funds for every particular state let us say it is a big ICE CUBE.It should be exchanged from one hand to other finally it reaches common people or slums or some other who are in need at that instance. But the size of ICE CUBE gradually goes decreasing so sir please take care
0 0 I am working as a banker. My suggestion is regarding education system. Most of the children in country goes to private school, but i did not understand the salary of a private school teacher is very less in compare to government school teacher. And the hard work done by a private school teacher is twice, thrice of a government school teacher. They got bonus in Diwali approx Rs.6000, but private school teachers are doing job on 5000-15000. kindly treat this as a suggestion it is my own view.
0 0 I live in Balliwala chowk, Dehradun . A flyover project had been initiated and after 1 year of delay ,proj is completed but no use.Chowk is broken from all sides ,no traffic light,lot of dust.a lot of gap has been left on the sides of the road which can expand the road by 4-5 feet extra.From where IMA is 6 kms away,4 dhaam yatra and spots like nainital and mussorie have a way, It really gives a wrong pic to the tourists.The whole city is dengue struck , so much dirt , pollution . pls do smthg.
0 0 Sir, the people of our country need to realise what a democracy is. People should realise that a democracy is a not only a government where we can elect our leaders, but is also a system where everyone participates to make our country a better place to live. We need people to participate in making Bharat a world power. If people have "fundamental rights", they have equally important "Fundamental Duties". Once all of us realise this, Bharat will be an unstoppable development machine.
0 0 The pension received by employees under the Employees' Pension Scheme 1995 remains unchanged no matter the cost of living index rises to any level in future. This is unlike the case of pension received by an employee retired from the Government service which increases to many folds in a short period after their retirement. I would humbly request you respected sir, to kindly arrange the needful such that all retired employees get  their pension based on the cost of living index from time to time.
1 0 Namaste sir, The land and river disputes in our country may harm the NATIONALITY. My wish is, all people should realise that WE ARE INDIANS and SHOULD NOT FIGHT with each other. We all are children of INDIA and should be together...Else the sacrifice of our soldiers will become waste,which should not be happen.
1 0 Our honourable prime minister always puts forth the most important topics during his speeches, but i personally would like to get the soldiers of our nation addressed along with girl empowerment and cross border terrorism, all the soldiers who were martyred protection our bkrders need the foremost mention on national platform to glorify them and their brave family.
1 0 Namaskaram During the brics summit at Goa all other countries spoke in their language but you spoke in English.

0 0 Last night I was reading about Mahatma Gandhi's assassination and suddenly something struck my mind it was the efforts Indians made in that freedom struggle. We respect and talk about our soldiers, dalits, casts, etc. on every platform but this is a part which we basically forget to mention. There were not just a few 10-15 leaders in that struggle whom we know but there were 100s of others who were left behind in our thoughts I believe this time they deserve our gratitude. #MyGov
0 0 Sir can you speak about depression and how it is effecting us, our families and in turn our society. We all need to talk to each other heart to heart and not mere socialise. We must support each other at every level. Our society need to fight it out together.
2 0 Sir I am working in Govt Health department for last 20 years and have observed that most of the young people contracting TB have a common habit of leaving for job or college without having breakfast. I think a lot of TB cases can be prevented by this single measure of  speeding the message of not to leave home without having breakfast  or on empty stomach. I think Mann ki bat is a very effective way to spread this very important message for our young people.Regards

0 0 Sir, Indian Mechanical Engineering Students except for iits or nits or other reputed institutes are jobless in-spite of having good academic records. Even some of the students of elite institutes of the above said branch find much difficulty in getting a job and are forced to take up jobs of some other domain by the institutes. Has this branch lost its relevance? What about #MakeInIndia along with #DigitalIndia?

0 0 Dear sir,  It is very painful to see  every alternate day the news of people committing sucide. Knowingly or unknowingly people are taking such extreme steps of ending their precious life  for some reasons but I don't think nothing in this world is impossible to solve their problems or stress.. along with them the whole family will suffer throughout the life So I kindly request you to urge people to promise themselves on this diwali not to decide those worst things in watever the sitiation it is

0 0 Respected Sir, Kudos to your invitation to write messages to our jawans. I did my bit as an Indian through this forum. 1. Do speak on motivating young children towards joining NCC, defense sector. Children listen to you. 2. Do talk about our martyred soldiers families and see to it that govt takes all possible care for their children's education and family welfare. 3. Infrastructure in cities also needs attention more than than rural areas. 4.I Support your call on # ban of Tripple Talak
1 0 Dear prime minister sir I just want to draw your attention towards a scarce source,water. At villages in indian households people are using submersible pumps,which can fetch so much quantity of water in minutes but all this water is not going to store anywhere but to be drained into nalah or sewers. Once they start the pump for any work it is not going to stop until the electricity is gone. a large amount of drinkikable water is wasted due to which water table is degrading day by day Thanks
0 0 Respected PM Modiji, it would be nice if you explain to the younger generation ie tomorrow's citizens who are instant noodle kids, the invaluable very precious lives of our soldiers, their bravery, determination, will-power that helps them live in extreme climates and the huge sacrifice of their lives for us and the sacrifices their families make to keep us safe. These kids have got everything easy & don't understand the value of struggles, failure, hard-work, sacrifice in making a person great.
0 0 Dear PM, 1.Issue is waste Management - resolution - set up more plants , more waste collection vehicles and facilities to be provided 2. Transport - Public transport is too much de-graded + roads are too much rough or either not sutaible for the amount of traffic they handle.- isllegal construction is major issue in this. 3.Water Management - very poor - need more facilities and improved systems to be delivered. 4.More infrastructure for telecom industries. 5.More gov awareness program req
0 0 There is an urgent need to identify the needs of education system and introspection whether the existing infrastructure is sufficient or not to cater to bright future of my country`s students.
0 0 Mere PM Modiji, the children of the martyred jawaans should be given utmost importance in education and if reservation can be given it should be given to them.Their widows and family shud be taken good care of. And plz tell Doordarshan to telecast a series showcasing bravery and stories of our Armed forces during battles where they fought against all odds and did not turn their back on enemy. If they who laid down their lives are remembered by us, it would be a great respect for them. Vichaariye
0 0 Hon'ble Prime Minister of India, Kindly make a thorough perusal of my suggestion given below regarding inclusion of credit balance of Employee's General Provident Fund (G. P. F.) while Sanctioning Home Loan amount by The banks:- At present, the matter of pity is that the Banks are not including the Employee's credit balance of G. P. F. Amount while Sanctioning the Home Loan Amount to him. This attitude or policy is, in fact, in contradiction to the present Home For All policy of G. O. I. unde

0 0 Dear Modi Ji, I want to express my concern about the extensive use of polythene bags, plastic bottles and other polythene wrappers. As we all know that these are very hazardous to our health and environment. It also very deadly to cows. Polythene being non biodegradable very hard to safely dumping or recycling. In my opinion polybags should be banned immediately. So, I would like to request you to make some policy regarding the ban of polythene bags. Thanks. Shubh Deepavali

0 0 Respected Sir, Many congratulations for organizing National Tribal Carnival for the First time. It will boost the self respect and connect them with the main stream. PM sir, Can we have our own Indian Type carnival parade in New Delhi, where everyone can participate, dance, enjoy and feel the rich traditional culture of warrior tribes across India. It can be like Samba Parade in Brazil. It will help in changing the attitude and stereotypes of our major people toward them. Regards, Kaniska
0 0 Dear Mr. PM, I have a concern abut new education policy which is going to be future of our next generation So I want to submit a suggestion that there must be period of meditation in every syllabus and a sports ust be compulsory for all students so that these two things improve the mental ability and focus of students to improve and innovate themselves. There should be a Yoga teacher and a Sports teacher in every school for mental and physical health improvement. Thanking you.

0 0 Respected Pradhan Mantriji, After the Paris Climate documents, This 2016 Diwali must be celebrated in a different way by calling it "HAREET DIWALI". Some suggestions regarding HAREET DIWALI: 1. HAREET DIWALI Fund BY CITIZEN: This can be raised by people saving a portion from the Diwali Cracker Budget and Donate it to the Fund. 2. This can be utilized in distributing Ornamental plants to Different Govt. Schools and placing Deodorizing plants in public toilets. Reagrds Kaniska Narayan

0 0 Dear Modi Ji You know that we all love and respect you. But I only want to tell you that if we indians are trying to boycott the chinese products then why don't you stop the import of any thing from China. We indians now understand the value of the indian things and we already have decided to boycott everything made in china. Then please its my kind request you to think about this matter. Thank You

0 0 The water grid can also be created by both state government and central government. Since vellore is going to become smart city, atleast this can be dried in vellore by connecting all the drainage and purifying the water either through distillation using solar energy or using RO. Since solar energy is plenty, distillation is the best and we can develope our own purification system. It will not be expensive.
0 0 Respected Sir, Please increase more Research budget in Solar Technology and Electrical vehicle Production, Because best way to reduce Pollution is only increase in use of Electrical  Cars. Also encourage people for use of Electrical Car and scooters.
0 0 Water problem is a major problem. We are having both drought and flood. The immediate need is we have to crate water grid through out our country very similar to power grid. Instead of joining rivers which requires lot of money and land acquisition, ecological clearance etc. But formation of grid is easy as we have to bury big pipes throughout the country. This can be done by creating a corpus fund from the public. In my town I have palar but there is no water. Only during flood water will come.
0 0 Sir I have uploaded a grievance on your webpage but till I don't get a soln. of that and this problem is common for all students of Rajasthan , So I request you to give a immediate result as mentioned in attached Image.
1 0 Respected Modiji, I wish to present before you that in your forth coming speech on "Mann Ki bath" programme , please advise  the people to stop burning crackers during diwali. It burns their  health as well as wealth. Let them donate that money to the nation as a contribution to soldier welfare fund or feed the poor by donating it to orphange.We can start a new culture which will give more shine to our diwali. Simutaneously let them light small clay lamps.Dr.C.Dileep,Asst Professor,Kerala
0 0 I wish u and our soldiers happy Diwali.I request u to speak about JE fever which has spread in Malkanagiri district of our state.I would also like to visit the area and console the parents who have lost their children.
0 0 Respected Prime Minister, Happy Diwali! A united India is a better and stronger India. Ours is a country of more than a billion people differing in language, culture and religion. The only thing that can bind us together is mutual respect for each other and acceptance of our differences; let us agree to disagree and still hold hands. I am disturbed by the intolerance and acts of violence around us. Please use the media programs like serials to promote tolerance and harmony among people.
0 0 Dear sir , i just have suggestion regarding the prevention of overcharging of meals in trains.Just provide an option for meal booking while booking a train ticket like the one used to provide bedrolls in garib rath .It would help in reducing practice of overcharging in trains .Moreover it would be good enough to replace the old cooking methods used in pantry cars with hitech ovens which would reheat the precooked meals .It would remove problems concerning food in trains and would boost railways.
1 0 Mr. PM. We are already working on betterment of our infrastructure. Meanwhile we can also make use of our existing ones in a more efficient manner. Like schools can be turned into career counselling centers/training/computer centers during the night. Also there must be a consolidated effort towards finding the aptitude of our students in their early teens, so they have a clear direction from an early age and we are able to produce graduates with a high level of specialization. #MannKiBaat #MyGov
0 0 Respected Prime Minister Sir, Jai Hind and Happy Diwali to you. First of all I would like to congratulate to you for all successful programmes launched by Our Government under your leadership. You are inspiration for us. Really our nation is changing and developing. The mission of Swacch Bharat has now become a vast program and we can see cleanliness at many places in our country. Gently request you to please initiate one more mission "Save Food, Produce Food" i.e, "Annam Raksham".
0 0 Food adulteration is a serious crime however, authorities do not have any concrete plan to deal with this. Food adulterators must be booked for attempt to murder or murder as the case may be. Swatch bharat campaign must be followed with swasth (healthy)bharat.

0 0 Adarniye PM ji. While wishing everyone a happy and prosperous Deepavali,please mention how 'andhakar' is being removed from the lives of our kisans in 10000 villages because electricty has been brought to their homes. Request that you suggest to those villagers and our farmer brothers and sisters that they can now increase their incomes by installing  solar modules on their houses and feed back electricity to the grid. They can get loans from Mudra and subsidies from the government to do that.
0 0 Honorable PM of India, please kindly do favour for our drought area in Dharmapuri District, Kadathur New Union at Tamilnadu. We need urgently water supply for drinking and irrigation purpose urgently. No rain fall in our area for last 10 years. Please arrange pipeline project system from Gothavari Nizamsagar to Mettur dam kaveri river link through via Krishna south pennar, paalar kallar, Bommidi RS to Thoppaiyar Dam to fill water urgently. Also sea water can be pumped from chennai vellore.

2 0 Respected Sir,our Indian Educational system must be made of talent based and not cast based.There must be an equal cutoff criteria in every examination as we expect an equality in genders also.Exam doesn't see a person as caste based and is equal to all so must be cutoff after every exams.thank you for this service so that everyone can give there opinion for building a better India.
0 0 Honorable Sir, since last few days there is a news regarding some new bank account opened for Army welfare and it asks people to deposit at least 1 Rs in it. No beneficiary name has been provided and account name is also doubtful. I and a lot of people believe this is fake account due to this as we already have defence fund. If this news is true please refrain the doubt in people minds . If not,order for inquiry of such types of frauds.
1 0 Sir,Can we teach students about value based education and build confidence in them so that they will become an employment generator rather than seeker. Teaching should be based on providing education for solving the challenges that they will face in their life from different dimensions not just securing marks by rote. Student vision should be for India first rather than seeking himself only. And this kind education will be provided by giving them responsibility(as per their age).
0 0 Honorable P. M. Sir, This is to request you to please develop a fair system for evaluation of TOLL being paid at STATE & NATIONAL highways and it's proper utilization since unlimited number of private & commercial vehicles pass through it every day fetching toll Authorities a huge some of money.Most of these tolls have made it an endless business with the help of certain corrupt officials
0 0 Dear Honorable PM Shri. Narendra Modijee, This month, A 13-year-old girl in Hyderabad died after fasting for 68 days as per Jain rituals during the holy period of 'Chaumasa'. This is sheer cruelty on the part of her family. Please talk on this issue. On one hand we are loosing our kids in tribal region due to malnutrition and here in a well to do family, a young girl died due to fasting in front of the whole family. Such religious practices should be banned by law.
0 0 Sir, It will be much helpful if biomatric system for the municipality pension holders of odisha can also be made as it is done for government pension holders so that the aged persons above 80/85 years of age can also receive their pension easily wherever they stay with their children within India. Thanking you.
0 0 Sir if slums in big cities are transformed in such a way that they look clean and tidy then you can rename the area to "Aadarsh Nagar", just a thought.
0 0 Respected sir I would lyk 2 draw ur attention towards disrespect of our national flag.I have seen it many times during 15/08 & 26/01 where flags are thrown on roads,dustbin etc.Bt there are some people at kashmiri gate isbt Delhi who takes money (donation) and pin up small paper flag on visitors shirt. problem is that  these flags are scattered  on raod & crushed by feet. I thought to stop those people but can't.our flag is symbol of our independence not a business thing. #mannkibaat

0 0 Dear Honourable Prime Minister, Initially, many thanks for giving us such platform where we can share with you our ideas. I personally feel, we need to think of making Election Commission and its process digital especially the Elections where many citizens like me face difficulties due to mobilisation/ migration to different states during the elections.
0 0 Honorable PM, Sir, recently you came to Vadodara for a public gathering, and we the citizens witnessed the best administrative personnel at their honest work, to make sure that our Beloved PM feels welcome to Home.But But But as you left the city, the life of common man was as usual, city was unclean as usual, no rules followed, nobody bothered...My question "Why the administrative wings can't think every individual as their beloved PM"...won't it make a BIG DIFFERENCE.. Thanks, Stalin
0 0 First of all I want to thank you Mr. Prime Minister for your sincere efforts towards Swacch Bharat Mission. Even I was careless earlier but after listening to your thoughts I got inspired. I have even seen in public  the feeling to throw the garbages in dustbin. We all Indians would always b grateful for having such a prime minister.
0 0 Hon;ble PM Please go through the file.
0 0 Dear Mr. Prime Minister, I think there should be an effective evaluation of government employees. Often we see/ face that the customers are standing at the desk and they keep on doing their own work. Because it is a myth that once you get a government job no one can sack you. Yesterday I saw a video on youtube showing a railway employee doing her personal work and people are waiting. As soon as someone protested she closed the counter.

Native/home cadre posting helps them and the nation.

0 0 #MannKiBaat: Modi jee I feel that in India our behavior varies markedly depending on the other person's social & financial status, gender,age, caste and creed..we are not polite to everyone, we may look down on people we feel are lower than us. Why is our behavior not dependent on our own 'sabhyata' . Don't all Indians have the right to dignity ? We can start with being polite to the people who come to work in our homes. They should not be shouted at..Right to dignity is every Indian's right..
0 0 Dear Sir, I want to draw your attention towards unnecessary usage of air conditioner in premises of govt as well as private, even in winter , where there is no external air & sound pollution.

Thanking you prasanta

It's only fuel efficient & low maintenance plane but can't be taken in 1st line in modern warfare

0 0 In late 1990s, government had initiated a one-by-scheme to increase number of tax payers. This resulted in adding a large number of tax payers & was discontinued in 2000. Can you please announce a new scheme, taking into account, current parameters to augment number of taxpayers?
0 0 Diwali,Eid and Christmas are 3 biggest festivals in our country. IT companies avoid festival season holidays even on such festivals. Such practices are killing our religious bonding and also are very bad for the future of our nation. Govt. should impose fine on companies which decide to avoid closure in such festive season. If the companies really have imp. work and business loss they will pay fine to government. This would earn revenue for govt. else company would shut the company. Jai Hind!
0 0 Respected Narendrabhai Modi, less than 4% of Indian voters pay income tax. India is 4th largest economic power globally. Indians are no longer poor. We have seen patriotic outpour after surgical strikes. I would like you to link paying taxes to this nationalistic sentiment. I also would like you to encourage 188 existing million PAN holders to file IT returns. If we don't pay taxes, what right we have to expect our governments to perform? #MannKiBaat, #MyGov, #AIR, #PMOnRadio

0 0 Sir, To promote the linguistic unity of India, it is essential that Hindi is promoted as the binding language for all Indians. However, to quell any feelings of Hindi being imposed among people of non-Hindi states, I suggest the following: 1) Each person whose mother tongue is not Hindi must mandatory study Hindi as a second language till class 10. 2) students of Hindi speaking states must compulsorily opt for a second language, like Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, etc till class 10th.
0 0 Sir, 1) In today's fast changing world, it has become essential for us to imbibe moral values and respect for our rich heritage among the young children during their formative years.Storytelling is an important tool for achieving this goal, and stories with visuals I.e. comics can come handy for the same. With a view to increase respect for Indian culture and values among kids, I suggest that Amar Chitra Katha may be made mandatory in the CBSE curriculum, at least in the primary classes.

Each time when I visit I see lot of change especially with cars and bikes on the road. Good job opportunities for youngsters which is good for the economy.

We can also make categories like if a product is totally made in India then a different symbol, and if partially then a different one. Best wishes

0 0 I would like to suggest idea for Swaach Bharat Abhiyan. My suggestion is to register all the street beggars in metros as swaachta karyakartas and they should be provided with camera phones to click pictures of people littering on streets. These images would then be submitted to local police stations for chalans.Each police station in a metro should have a swaachta cell for this purpose. The program should also be incentivized for more participation. This would help us to make a better India.
0 0 Respected Sir, CREATION OF NEW ALL INDIA SERVICE: INDIAN JUDICIAL SERVICE Lot of concern regarding huge backlog/pendency of cases in the courts of law but nothing is happening. Chief Justice is finding fault with the Government as it is not filling up the posts of Judges in all the courts.

Better to set up Indian Judicial Service on the lines of IAS/IFS/IPSetc SurinderDat

0 0 As a kid, I was always told that India is bound to be a super power since we will have the largest working population by 2020. But today, the world is changing so rapidly that adaptation is the only mode of survival and in this case, I feel, that our education is lagging behind. A gun without bullets or bullets without a gun are of no use, similarly, youth without knowledge or skills will not lead us anywhere. Let's not create jobs, let's create people who can create their own jobs!
0 0 The joy of riding a cycle is magical, and these cyclists are the true torchbearers of the Save the Earth Campaign. In todays fast paced technological world, we often tend to neglect the implications of our actions on our well being and on our environment. Cycling on the other hand is environment friendly. If it isn't already a part of your everyday routine, there's no time to start like the present. We ride back on these two wheels to a better future. A drive to a better Earth....

1 0 Sir just a simple request on a controversial topic. i.e. Reservation. The main aim of reservation was to attain right to equality. Nowadays there are people from reserved category who have used the reservation in good use and developed themselves.

And provide it to all other students with poor background based on their merit and not caste

0 0 Dear Prime Minister, I am very glad to write you. First of all i want to thank you for doing a lot for our country. Yes all of your steps are going into right direction but i think that all your ideas like 'SWATCH BHARAT ABHIYAN' or others become successful only when there is a control of population in our country. I have listen all your speech and lectures but never found that you talk about population control. So please take any action on population growth.
0 0 Respected PM Modi. D first thing in my mind is that India cannot progress if a political parties do not co-operate    with d party in rule. If there is no unity among d parties then BJP will b obstructed at each work they do.

0 0 Hon'ble Prime Minister I have lot in my mind to talk about.Many of us have posted here that each one want to help the gov in the welfare activities of our brave hearted soldiers and development of the defence forces.I really appreciate their thoughts.What I think is what if we deduct a very negligible amount from every citizens bank account every year with their concent.Think of the whole population or even half of it contributing.We can safeguard our borders and even the soldiers families.
0 0 Sir, Our farmers are experiencing very tough time. they keep on waiting of monsoon and they are growing crops hardly one or two times in a year, which is not good for nation.we should set some independent commission which will decide the sale price of their crops and their training, soil testing, every basics needs required for crops growing. we should also provide some system like Fire department water pipe line so that they can utilise the water at any time in the year in their land.

0 0 Modi ji, Being a computer engineer, there is always one question rays again & again in my mind.Why government doing out-sourcing for their portals & websites? Why don't we have one government IT company or infrastructure, govt is paying high amount to the private companies, then why don't we think on government IT sector. It may also improve the quality of governance & might be a helpful jump to reduced the corruption. Youth is eagerly waiting to work for the government in IT sector.#MannKibaat

1 0 Dear PM Sir, You had started a very worthy scheme: Startup India, Standup India. Sir, if practically viewed it seems for just the reserved sector of India. What's the value of scheme then? If a poor individual belongs to General category, has a great business initiative, but can't apply to get any benefits under the scheme because the government only allows reserved category applicants as the eligible candidate for the scheme. Sir, is this really justice and can this benefit all equally?

Less cost on education more India grow.

Lethargy or attitude of avoidance has made Policing an object of ridicule and mockery.If only PM and HM can take effective steps to educate and motivate local Police to be on constant vigil, whether in or out of Uniform, and offer protection for genuine action India would be accidents free and incidents free
0 0 Sir  Your Government has made all efforts to make  GST a reality in India.  Regarding the rate we need to be very careful.  Same item should not find place in two different tariffs. Eg a machined component may be used in a machine and also as a automobile component.  If the rates for the part used in machine and part used in automobile are different it will create confusion. Anti profiteering provisions should be made in some form or the other for a minimum period of one year

By this, the outcome would be marvellous as we can inculcate the feeling of commitment in them! Also politicians should unite for this cause!

It should not be compulsary to buy a new set of books in each session. If someone wants he should have option of taking old set of books.

I firmly feel that mindset of anyone can be changed by engaging kids in Skill  developemnt, education and sports at he place of detention Regards
0 0 We have many pilgrim places in India 12Jyotirling of Shiv,4dham and as in Maharashtra I am aware about Alandi,Tuljapur,Pandharpur,Ghrshneshwar where lakh of people are coming daily/weekly But these pilgrim places are still having poor development. Roads are very poor in quality, no cleanliness as these will come in Grampanchyat/Nagarpalikas. If we create "Smart Pilgrims" in all over India, it will increase more tourism as of current situation. People who will come with devotion will inform other
2 0 Honorable prime minister i want to say that your schemes does not make sound at ground level. for instance - Ujjawala scheme in my town all cylinders distributed only in rich people and all the poor are deprived of it . you should make a committee in order to take cognizance of it . Otherwise in policy making not any difference between your gov. and previous I am late for this information because i has been unable to do

0 0 Dear Honourable Prime Minister, Your own BJP Party are striving at Tuensang District, Nagaland. The BJP party volunteers and workers are not given any opportunity or financial assistance nor any schemes launched by the Central BJP government. As such, we express the problems of the BJP, BJYM and BJMM on your desk. I have attached herewith a proposal from your own children. Do please give us the opportunity to work for BJP smoothly and help us while we struggle to promote the party.
0 0 Respected Sir, please evaluate the opportunity of government celebration of Diwali rather than making it an individual festival.The government can designate some areas where fireworks will be lit and the same can be viewed by all. Rather than every individual buying crackers and add to air, noise pollution. It may be difficult to engage the crowds but the change has to begin.
0 0 Dear PM, If you could send 50 thousand Indian students for post graduation to countries of their choice with condition that they return and work or teach in India, It could improve our academic culture. We are losing 20 billion dollars every year due to students going abroad for higher studies. We can save a lot in just two to four years, if 50k students go and come back and teach here. Also please allow schools to run in rented premises at least in the small villages and towns as part of NEP

0 0 Respected Mr. Prime Minister, The inclusion of cellular technology has given us the needed connectivity but has widened the gap within the society. To increase the social bond there is a suggestion. Students enrolled in NCC/NSS in various institutions can be alerted when someone is in distress based upon the location. A gazetted officer can approve the student based upon the severity of emergency. MHRD can give some incentive (waiver of fees) based upon effective accomplishment.
0 0 Dear sir, kindly focus on Air connectivity issue of one of the fastest growing city of india, Surat. world's only City with population of 5.5m has no proper air connectivity and international airport. SURAT is hub of diamond, textile and many other industry. THIS city has potential to be the next metro city of india, as well as Global city of World. Being a NRI It's take to long time to reach home from Dubai to surat via Mumbai or Ahm. Remember your old word to make Surat as Singapore.
0 0 Please educate pedestrians on how and when to cross the roads,importance of using footpath wherever possible and motorists to honk less and follow simple Lane discipline. I know there are bigger problems in our country to solve but it is sad that we still do not understand the importance of motorist and pedestrian rules. Everyday Many accidents occur due to pedestrian jumping and crossing anywhere and in turn resulting to motorist honking. Thank you
0 0 Respected Sir, Some easy suggestions for preventing frauds on Debit/Credit cards. 1.By default all cards should be disabled for International usage unless the customer wants 2. it should be possible to enable or disable the international usage facility by Phone banking or Internet Banking 3.If a card is detected as being being swiped outside India, the system should ask for another pin. The pin should able to be changed by Phone Banking or Internet Banking
1 0 As every industries are present in Metro cities, so people from villages have to come for work in metro and leave their parents and villages alone and they have to stay far from home. So cant we start initiative as "One Village One Industry" so people staying in villages get jobs within their village itself and they don't have to go far from their parents. If it succeed then metro will not get over populated and villages should not became empty. Due to this villages will also become smarter
0 0 Dear Respectable Prime Minister, This is regarding the recent frauds on Credit cards. One should be able to Disable/Enable international feature by phone banking or Internet banking, so that the international usage feature is allowed for the moment it is required. By default it should be disabled, unless the customer wants. Further when the card is detected by the system as being used/swiped outside India, it should ask for another pin. I feel these can be implemented easily. Regards

0 0 My wife Mamta Matta suggests that there is an imminent and immediate need to make compulsory military service for young Indians for at least two to three years as is prevalent in various countries. This shall enable more discipline and love for Nation and generate camaraderie with compassion for national good.

0 0 Hi Sir, please form a young and effective and unbiased committee, send them to different parts of the country and they can let you know the reality so that you can make much effective decisions on governing and have a insight about what is really going on, and troubled places like Bihar and gurgoan please send in some NGO's in there and educate people on how to behave and how lead life in a civilized manner so that the honor killings might be reduced
0 0 All our ministers (including PM)are Top Most Government person. In their public address they must speak as Government Representives and not as member of any political party.

0 0 Hello sir, we can have clean India if we the state governments and central governments work together why can't the central government collaborate with every state government and form one central committee to clear off stray dogs and buffaloes on road across India to create a clean environment and swachbharat is not really working in southern part of India sir.especially in Hyderabad.the roads are horrible in Hyderabad, its high time sir we need to have atleast good roads and dogs off the street
1 0 Sir,I am totally impressed your successfully concluded IDS and I suggest you to take a 'Surgical Strike' on all Indian filmy personalities for hiding the black money without any fear and partiality.Openly the common men are knowing how much they earning and how much they disclosing.
0 0 Militancy anywhere in the world is a matter of serious concern even if it is in Pakistan. We are suffering from various forms of militancies for a long time whether it is Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orrissa, J&K, or Northeast. We must understand the reasons of people turning militants and tackle.
0 0 Skills are not born only in school, college, institution and at any special place and religion or title. School, College and institutions have all ready recognized for skill person.

0 0 Sir, I appreciate Swachha Bharat movement, I would like to give one suggestion which I think can make this movement more effective. Sir we don't have sufficient DUSTBIN on roads. Dustbins should be available at walking distance, so that we will be able to throw things in dustbin. For this we can encourage people to keep small dustbin outside of there Shop or Home.
0 0 I saw many people comments and complaints after surgical strike by India on Pakistan and many of those shows lots of disrespect to our army, some even made by politician just to get publicity. The reason behind it is they don't know how army works and perform to give their best to save ourselves and nations. My suggestion to PMO is to mandate and make it compulsory for all citizens of India to perform in army for two years as soon they turn 18 years old so that they know how & what army does.
0 0 Dear Sir 1. Ban access of accessories from those countries who support Pak led terrorism. 2. There are huge vacant land by the side of railway track miles after miles. Plant Fruit-Trees there. 3.

0 0 What our government is doing for poverty alleviation? Some days before I came to know through media, As per Global Hunger Index Report UN released total list of 118 countries and India stand as 97 out of 118.In India 39% children are undeveloped due to lack of adequate nutrition. Total 15.2% population of India is suffering from Malnutrition. The GHI (UN) given 28.5 score to India. As per report our neighboring country Nepal,Bangladesh,Mayanmar and Srilanka is better than India.
1 0 #MaanKiBaat Dear PM Sahib...Jai Bharat. It is humbly requested that the wages of Army/security personnel etc should be enhanced and those who sacrifies their lives for the sake of the Nation should be declared as "BHARAT-PUTR" officially and his family is rewarded with at least Rs:One Crore irrespective of the state he belongs too. We as an united society and nation can easily do this. With best wishes and warm regards. Kishore Kumar Sharma alis Vidhrohi...Zirakpur(Mohali).
0 0 Hi Sir, Kindly explain the uniform civil code in very layman language as to what does it contain and clear the myths that people debate about the same? I guess, even going forward, it is always beneficial to explain the new laws or benefits to people in the language they understand through this. Since it comes from the PM, people will not doubt further. Jai Hind.
0 0 Kindly encourage small local labors and farmers so that we can improve our market and if we boycott foreign goods for continuous 90 days strictly like emergency period, definitely US dollar will come down to five rupees. Also, kindly take action to get cauvery water supply to Tamilnadu as we are really shortage of water. Our main task is Agriculture, Bringing Black Money, Good Education, Improving Local market, reducing petrol and diesel rates, etc.
0 0 Dear Modiji, Namaskar. Jai Hind. Vande Mataram. Jai Shree Ram. Happy and Prosperous Diwali to you. I pray sincerely to God and my spiritual Master Sri Gnanananda Giri Maharaj to shower more strength and blessings upon you for more tenures as PM. Kindly take severe and strict action on Pakistan as we are facing more and more lives of jawans almost everyday. Kindly insist to develop agriculture immediately as we are in need of the hour. Strictly boycott Chinese products even electronics also.
0 0 take pledge that all indians are our brothers and sisters.Let us act in this direction and make the pledge meaningful by taking care of our dalit brothers and sisters..
0 0 I had few friends who belong to dalit community.They are very affectionate and innocent people and we have to treat them with affection.  The dalit colonies represent the most lopsided face of our development policies.Ward members,MLAs to visit such colonies make and assessment of the situation and use their funds to improve the situation.Even individual citizens and civil society can interact with them ,understand their problems ,bring them to the notice of authorities for further action.we
0 0 him but have we ever thought of how many days he had been without food?? The food that we eat today are the effort of their labour and our streerts are clean due to their efforts.The society has given them torture ,discrimination,ill treatment,poverty..etc.They are not even aware of their rights as a citizen  as they are toiling from dawn to dusk for a livelihood and rarely get time to fight for their rights.So we have to reach out ot them.
0 0 Dear Sir, With regard to Swatch Bharat though people have become conscious of keep their locality clean there need to be Swatch Toilets at prominent locations in all cities and towns and help citizens to be good citizens. No one intends to urinate or defecate but the urgency and non availability of swatch public toilets make them do such shameful act. Request you to involve local authorities and plan for a scheme to bring cleanliness and maintenance of public toilets
0 0 Here are some helpful info about bio-degradable plastics downloaded in PDF.
0 0 Sir, I requested to you, we need to focus on our farmer and give him new technology and loan for improve his/her production, because Farmers trend now seems to be working slowly, so the government will have to take some good steps, and the government must stop using agricultural land misuse. And should not be built on farm land.All these facilities/technology give the best rate/discount. Jai Javan Jai Kisan Jai Hind Jai Bharat
0 0 Sir Dalits are attacked for various reasons in our  country.A major issue in this regard is that they are mostly attaced on the issue of killing of cows.How long can a person survive without food?? The abject condition of poverty that compel them to kill cows for food as dead cows are the only food available to them without facing objection from others.They have a no intention to offend religious sentiments of our society.If ever a dalit have been caught attacking a cow the society has punished
0 0 Respected Modiji, Kindly have a talk about bio-degradable plastics @ your upcoming MANN KI BAAT, so that we can reduce the environmental pollution whether it is water or land or air polluition. Have a complete ban of plastics and to engage the people of our country in using and producing bio-degradable plastics which can be easily degraded by burying and by the action of micro-organisms. http://www.biostockspro.com/7-advantages-of-biodegradable-plastics/

0 0 Aadharaniya Prime minister I would like to invite your attention regarding road traffic rules violation.you can assess the fact that accidents are causing loss of life ,money,energy etc. In this occasion I would like you to invite our techies to develop a soft ware in the form of sensors that,shouldnt allow a person while driving to use mobile phone.I think it can reduce the accident rate.Thus we can save money for our country. Respectfully Raji Kerala
0 0 Respected Sir, I can feel positive vibrations under your government, which were missing earlier. Sir, Air Pollution is getting worst day by day in delhi and other metro cities. We may encourage peoples to use environment friendly options like cycling to office(if possible),use of public transport etc. Some sort of encouragement to the peoples who use cycle for their daily activities and we need to change the common thought that cycle is for poor and it is not as per our status. Thanks Jai Hind.
0 0 Respected PM, I would like to draw your attention towards an issue we are failing to heed — INCREASING CRUELTY TOWARDS ANIMALS. In the recent times a number of incidents involving sadistic and insensitive approach towards animals have surfaced. If this issue is not addressed, innocent animals would continue to suffer at the hands of human recklessness. I request you to urge the people of this country to treat animals with respect and care and enforce stricter punishments against miscreants
0 0 Sir, Please read my point on farmers. i have attached a file. Jai Shree Ram
0 0 Dear Sir I would say government is doing good in every field .but there is need of action of every plan which are in existence ,and to get any results action is highly important which is slow need to be fast,further highly quality education is missing in rural area specially attention required there,another most important thing population pressure need to take some plans to balance rural & urban ratio,
0 0 Defining 'Rights of residents' and protecting them will go a long way in ensuring security and social harmony in Indian society.  Parking vehicles in front of residences, playing and assembly of people, loud-speaker or vehicular or other noise, creating pollution or dumping garbage near residences: all these are to be considered as violation of 'Rights of residents'.  Legal and government support should be provided to prevent citizen rights. Then, dominance of bad over good could be prevented.
0 0 Govt should allow artist to paint railway stations boogies, public buses / transport, roads etc and put their name and signature + artist photo if they want. This is win win situation for both. Artist will get publicity + govt will save money in painting their assets + city will be beautified. Eg. - Public get bored of seeing same color boogie of local trains in Mumbai for ages. If this is implemented, then public can expect different artistic colors in all trains etc.
0 0 Success of Swachha Bharat will be dependent on the working of local governments (Panchayat, Municipality, city corporations).  Corporators and other local representatives are to be inspired to keep the city clean. Initiatives of Central and state governments can reach citizens only through the local government and elected representatives. High levels of compliance with principles of urban planning, not violating building plans, providing adequate parking space in new constructions are required
2 0 Sir, Please implement reservation system only on basis of income, but not on caste system. I see my friends who are open category students, but poor, they can't get any assistance from government. IN future if it continuous then people forms groups on basis of caste.  This may collapse unity of this great country
1 0 I feel current generation is loosing importance of Army men mainly children. To make children realize the value of army, schools should invite Army men / Ex-Army men from their locality or near by and honor them during Republic day &/ Independence day. This will give dual benefit, 1st Army veterans or current serving Army men will get their honor form locals + children from childhood will be related to this issue. This will also help army to get aspirants candidates in future.
0 0 Dear Sir, First of all I Salute to our military soldiers who have lost their lives for the sake of our conuntry. I am proud to be indian. I belong to Powerlinks Transmission Company Limited , It is a joint venture of Tata Power and Powergrid. Now winter season has to be start and there will be a problem of Electricity Transmission Lines due to dense fog and other problem is that some of the villagers used to fly kites near the transmission lines due to infringement of Kite thread made by china ,
1 0 Dear PM, There should be a phone number on which for each missed call Rs 10-15 should be charged which should directly go to 'Army Battle Casualty Fund'. Advantage: 1. Rs 10-15 is very small amount so a person with minimum income can contribute. 2. Everyone has mobile these days, so its very easy to contribute (no internet banking/no visit a bank/any other payment mode). This will give common people a sense of direct connect with our Security Forces by directly helping their families.
0 0 Just an thought for getting info on domestic black money - Govt should give the whistle-blower / informer 10% of the amount black money recovered + 90% of the amount should be put in the village (of his choice) to make it smart village + to give his name to one of the street in an honor. If the informer lives in city, then his building / ward / area - roads, waste mgt, sewerage etc should be repaired or developed or develop public transport in his area etc
0 0 Subject: MUNNA solution for a BIGGER problem There remains a shortage of coins in Indian market all the time. A big cause for the shortage is the innocent ‘good’ habit of coin collection by young kids, but they store (‘stash’) the  coins for several months/years in their money boxes. Our beloved PM may call upon the children to frequently take out coins and hand over to their parents in exchange for currency notes while they leave for shopping (and gradually exchange for big currency notes)
0 0 Sir I agree many toilets have been built and more are under construction, but people don't use them as they are dirty and smell badly. Waterless urinals are installed in many public toilets abroad, the urine passes through a trap which contains a chemical gel and which neutralises the smell. The urine just passes on to the waste pipe, and there is no need to waste precious water on flushing.
0 0 respected Sir, On this platform I want to ask that you are believing that air-connectivity is very important for progress and development of any city. Then why the 9th largest city of the country didn't given the international airport till date? The diamond city which produces 8 diamond out of 10 at the world level and which produces high amount of fabric each day is lacking in the air connectivity issue. So what you are going to do for this issue before state election of Gujarat?
0 0 (1) Now a days on-line shopping like Amzon, Snapdeal, Flipcart etc are attracting customers and manufactures are also selling their good in very less price than MRP to these on-line service providers, is it possible government to intervene and get on-line shopping away by regulating manufactures to direct sale their products to customers without giving brokerage ( to on-line companies (2) Best affordable (rate)daily need items for common man (3)Revie on MP & MLA funds and its proper utilisation
0 0 Sir instead of unsafe and polluting crackers let us have huge and beautiful public displays of fireworks as they do in advanced countries. The whole country stops to watch the fireworks on Bastille Day in France or the King's birthday in Thailand. Let us light up our homes and cities but we can have safe fireworks carried out by professionals which would be truly spectacular.
1 0 All dependants of defence personnel who lost their lives for our country should be given at least amt of Rs. 51 lakhs with jobs to their kins, free education with financial assistance to their children. Starting from the year 2016 the facility should be extended to all those who were martyred for the country in earlier years. 2.       99% of Indians not aware of accounts details for donation to martyred defence personnel . Accounts details should be published in newspapers/TV/govt bills etc.
0 0 Dear PM,India belongs to a way long traditions and cultures but always said to be land of extremes.Many people here are always following blind faith ex.Devdaasis(small girls) dedicated to goddess Yelamma who later join the occupation of prostitution.We have to raise a voice for controlling this types of extremes.And also at least show some respect towards third genders and child labours.

0 0 Dear Sir, One suggestion please . I am working in L&T Oman from last 6 year and I have seen in whole GGC countries they have very good system for renewal of car insurance and registration , In India : Car insurance and Registration are not linked up therefore you can renew your car registration without renewing of car insurance.

I do not have the good luck of having a daughter of my own but my heart cries for every girl child who is not given an opportunity to live her life. I have a lot of desire to work in this direction but I'm directionless. I hope you can shed some light on how many women like me can contribute to this noble cause. The initiative is excellent but it needs foot soldiers to become successful
0 0 The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao movement is a revolutionary one. However it has to reach the grass root levels. The idea that a girl child is a burden needs to me removed for which public education is a must. If the government can film a series of short stories which cover the life story of successful women ( sports, business, academics, etc) and relay this as episodes on DD or any other private channel it will make a huge impact on the minds of people. stories of women from rural background.

0 0 We are still imbibed in the principle of tax the tax payer. A new thinking needs to be brought in. Incentive the tax payer. He is the gold medalist. Help more people win medals. If not we are only making sure that the hardworking honest citizen stops his hard work or migrates outside of India. An example, is why is loans not given easily to an individual who has a high growth in his taxes. There is no evaluation for this and no incentive to pay higher tax.

0 0 Dear PM, My thoughts regarding the education has to be equal to all. Means, the syllabus has to be same for all the students all over India. Apart from this, Sanskrit has to be must for all classes for all students. In history they should study about our ancestors, who's rulled us not by someone from another part of the world who came to India later on ruled us
0 0 Every Indian, who portrays extraordinary determination, grit & conviction towards fighting against the odds in life, to become an example for the masses, is a soldier par excellence, more so if its a woman. We have seen tremendous amount of hype around the Beti Bachaao program. The program talks about Female Feticide & about education for the girl child. However, being able to take birth on this planet, alone cannot ensure the development of girl child. What follows after the birth is most IMP

0 0 Respected Sir, caste based Reservations system have become a big challenge india's progress. To overcome this system, we should do the following : 1. Provide educational,social and monetary incentives and facilities to economically backward caste/community at the education level (upto graduation level). 2. after that they will become more competitive when they come out fro college. 3. Remove asking caste/Religion in all types of forms. 4. remove article 370 for better development of J&K.

Many cases pending in various court in our country, though the judiciary gives  timebound judgements to various Dept's, to execute the orders in time why cannot the judiciary may be fixed a timelimit to dispose a case
0 0 Respected sir, With all due respect i would like to draw your attention on liquor ban in Gujarat. Though it's enforced in the Gujarat almost 50 years back, still it's easily available and even a 14 year old kid can easily access it.I have grownup in a small town in the Gujarat and well aware of the situation there.If a 14 years kid knows the place where he can get the liquor i am sure the enforcement responsible must be aware of that. #MannKiBaat, #MyGov, #AIR, #PMOnRadio Thanks Milap

0 0 Respected Sir, Wishing you a Happy Diwali in advance.

0 0 Respected Modi Ji, I wish this Diwali you need to talk to the Educators of our country who represent the light in the true sense in Mann ki Baat. Bharat was a knowledge society in the past and it still is though we are not able to actualize our potential. Without bringing out a shift in our primary education we won't be able to transform the country into an inspired Nation. All the best and wish you Shubh Deepawali.
0 0 Sir, Please make government officials responsible for infrastructure projects more accountable. For all the roads that are laid - within 6 months craters start developing. This is the tax payer's money at work. Why shouldn't the government officials be made accountable for such poor quality roads? Why should contractors not be deducted of their fees if they cant provide a minimum of 2 year's warranty/ guarantee on the roads that they lay? Please have a comprehensive policy for this. Regards
0 0 Dear PM Sir, Reservations to SC/ST/OBC have become a big challenge to General category people.Govt. should provide ample educational,social and monetary incentives and facilities to such categories instead of caste,community based reservations.I agree that it is most onerous task but then who else but you can set things right.
0 0 Dear Prime Minister Modi ji, I have a concern about reservation system in our country. The reservation system is quite complicated and cannot be removed easily. Because of this lot of communal clashes are taking place between reserved and non-reserved communities. I have a solution for this. Why don't you promote and implement the way of giving up reservation as you did in the case of gas subsidy? It will also benefit people in reserved community who are below poverty line. Thank you.

0 0 We just returned from Kashi.We were shocked to see cows at every corner of Varanasi. As it is traffic is horrible and on top of that no one follows any rules. These cows can be hurt any moment by vehicles. The roads leading to the Dashashwamedh ghat should be made totally vehicle free, only for the aged and handicapped electric vehicles should ply. The hawkers will never move so people should at least be able to walk without being knocked down by bikes.People still take bath with soaps as no o

0 0 sir, I dont know if this thing is to be shared on this forum or not, but I tried all the ways to reach you yet failed. Can you do something for our judiciary system ? My family will not have a Diwali this year as the only son of my parents is behind the bars from last 6 months in some fake case..we are not able to bring him out, all because of lack of investigation and lack of judicials in system. (the concern is on leaves, and the application can not be listed at any other bench). Please Help
0 0 I would suggest to convince people to leave behind one bad habit on the occasion of Diwali and opt a new habit. e. g Bad habit could be smoking, not respecting fellow passengers, Not giving seats to fellow needy travelers. Good habits could be opting for Surrounding cleanliness mission, respecting women, children's, elderly people, Having sound proof and pollution free Diwali etc. If Mr. PM says convey this kind of message, am sure people will follow it and it will root some moral values
0 0 Dear Prime Minister, kindly talk about our own education system... The one which focussed on hard work.... Not the present one which thinks child needs to be cuddled only... The children today do not even know tables of 2 and 3.they cannot even read,Specially in govt skuls. Private skul k bacche sab pdh lete hai.. Kyu ki wahan school aaj bhi waise hi pdha rhe hai... Homework abi bhi utna hi diya jata hai.. Not like our govt. Sir i resigned from kvs bcoz of this. Shubham pathak

I suggest forming of a permanent Military Commission

0 0 Hi Dear Modi Sir! I have only one suggestion. We need to add meditation classes in schools, colleges and universities as well. We all know the benefits of meditation or Yoga. It develops the sensitivity and consciousness. If we have higher consciousness then rest works may be done very easily without any effort. If everyone in the country is taught meditation, we will eliminate violence within one generation.So please please do something for this. Thank you Regards, Dinesh

I want to bring one more corruption into your notice which is becoming a huge pain for people. That is in the name of ICUs in Hospitals. Family members become really helpless, if any patient goes into ICU/OT. What happens inside ICUs nobody can know. They are doing any operation or not, even patient is alive or not no body knows. If any death happens, people do
0 0 Hello sir,this time while addressing the nation please do mention about not only armed force but also all those security forces who keep us safe from within the borders. please try to mention the sacrifice made by their families,who most of the time celebrate their festivals without them.

0 0 happy diwali to indian army who risks their lives and died proudly for this country i salute them jai hind
0 0 Saying "Happy Diwali"to army is a welcome initiative.I did it.But my mind says to do more.In fact after Uri Attack some spurious websites were asking for donations and I was about to fall in trap.From then, I began to think, Why not an Authentic Prime Minister's Fund fully dedicated to the Indian Soldiers where people can donate as per capability - May be a Rupee?Let the donation be like crowd funding with online credit facility.Its good if data analysis possible for finding donors category.

0 0 Respected Sir i would like to add my views on swatch  Bharat abhiyan. Sir, i am seeing and feeling that awareness about cleanliness has increased very significantly across the country by the steps taken by you and people are contributing as much as they could. but just want to highlight one point that is still a part of our municipal corporations are not able to provide proper collection, segregation and disposal of wastes and garbage. if it is improved surely India will be cleaner & greener.
0 0 Greetings Sir, Diwali is round the clock and as usual poor potters who make make Diya and other items of decorations for Diwali are gonna return empty handed because people tendency to buy OTHER products. So it will be really good if people start considering buying these goods too. And second is the amount of pollution caused by crackers. If everyone would just try to reduce the crackers they burn then it would definitely bring change.
0 0 Through Community Policing for the Swatch Bharat Abhiyan, People will be made responsible for ensuring cleanliness at public places. This will also give them sense of ownership for public places/property. If public develop sense of ownership for the public property then they will definetely start keeping it clean and will start monitoring that it is not uncleaned by anyone. Community Policing could serve the purpose for the success of Swatch Bharat Abhiyan. Thanks
0 0 Resppected Sir, I like to Congratulate u for the kind of hard work u r doing for us. We are actually very proud to have u as our Prime Minister. My suggestion is regarding the Swach Bharat Abhiyan. People throw waste on roads and public places.There is need to sensitize public that public property is for public therefore it is their duty to protect & make the it clean and if someone make it dirty,people should monitor it through Community policing.This willcreate sense ofOwnership among ppl
0 0 Everyone should understand their responsibility to words social works doctor should give at least 1 hours to poor people on daily basis and school should also. Business man should organize training programs in their areas so it will be good for nations. Government officers should also come on ground reality and support to the people of India. Government hospital staff should only need to shoft spoken. The innocent people wants this only.
0 0 Respected PM I have an idea for those people of India who they have saficent income, they should use 10% of their incomes in social activities in their area only. Like their village, Mohallah,city from himself do not give money to anyone if no lights on social places they can put street lights and also they can use that money to make mobile toilets and many more thing to do. And this will helps in nation building.

0 0 Dear Reader My concern is for farmers of India who struggle a lot due to the continuous hard work they do,to decrease that we can take the following steps- 1.Out of all the farmers very few have tractors and other machines. 2.The districts of India,where most of the people are farmers should have a department/office where we can have all the important machines. 3.Farmer who wants any kind of work to be done in his field can approach to the office. There are more steps but word limit is less

1 0 Dear Sir, Nowdays mobile usage is everywhere. It has become a part our daily work. And our mobile number is connected/linked to various financial transactions. Ex: ATM withdrawals, Bank OTP confirmation...etc. So it is very important to secure these transactions. Recent incident many bank debit card details has been hacked. So my suggestion is to make strict policies towards financial transactions, implementing bio metric system while ATM withdrawal, instead of Mobile OTP is the best option.

0 0 Road accidents is a major cause of deaths and disabilities in India. Our youth are the most affected and we lose hunderds of lives in their prime. I would like to suggest that we introduce 3-4 hours of annual mandatory road safety curriculum right from high school to graduation. 4-6 years of regular exposure to road safety will go a long way in changing the road safety culture among youth. I am ready to help with such an initiative.

0 0 Respected PM ji, jai jawan kosh is once again reverberating  in air by your call. But you have to give attention to Jai kishan kosh also. Farmers issues are  to be  resolved and the MSP of their produce must be fixed to an amount of half of the retail selling price to consumers.  Govt vision and mission should move from cities to villages. Inequality existing between farming community and salaried group should be minimised.

1 0 Respected Sir, There are various meetings that have concluded regarding climate change, which is accompanied by  the ratification of Paris Agreement by the Government of India on Gandhi Jayanti, and recent meeting in Rwanda regarding the HFCs. There is very little awareness among people regarding these climate change talks and the position of India regarding this. In my view this month discussion should focus on the Paris Summit and the Montreal Protocol discussion held recently. Thanks

0 0 Sir, Saffron is among the most expensive spice and also considered as "Red Gold".Kashmir is the only state where This "gold" can be grown. It is of strategic importance. Saffron is a labor-intensive crop which needs the flimsy crimson red strands to be plucked laboriously by hand. I would like to ask my government to motivate the production which will on one hand increase the income and on other hand give mass employment in our beloved Kashmir. Thanks.

0 0 Sir, My point is that Seventh Pay Commission recommendations have been worst in the last 17 years.  The people are unhappy with the increase in salaries and pension recommended by the commission because the government has failed to rein in inflation.People are unhappy and dissatisfied, especially those working in lower levels in the government because inflation has gone up. The price rise has kept the benefits of pay commission from reaching people. We will wait for next 10 years. Thankyou sir.
0 0 Sir You are the true leader of this country Shri Narendra Modi Ji we(youth) of this country inspire alot from your speeches which addresses nation as one .Media should be controlled by government if any one shows false news they should be punished seriously .All government sectors should be digitalized to save time and to avoid corruption

0 0 Dear sir, As we all know a nation is recongnised by its economic status, as india imports oil and defense products, my idea is .. 1- to minimize oil product , all the railway and metro tract shound be roofed with solar plates which is enough to run train 2- another example is sirdi mandir kitchen using  solar energy... 3-alternately air power and hydropower 4- we should develop laser technology and robotic weapon to help defense . I ve gr8 ideas to strengthen our economy will tell later
