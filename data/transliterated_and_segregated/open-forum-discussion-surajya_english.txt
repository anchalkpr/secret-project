32 4 Dear Mr. Prime Minister, the clean & green world initiated by you is a great service to the mankind and we take pride that you are our leader to the world.
15 3 #Surajya(5/n) 3. MNREGA: Here I would like to state that definitely Congress has meshed up, now let it put in right direction. I am surprised why this scheme is not being utilized in nation building. Still this scheme is being utilized in making excavation, then that place gets filled up then again people are making excavation at the very same location. Hence by illusion of increasing capacity of reservoir, nothing is happening at all. No contribution towards nation building.
40 0 #Surajya (4/n)Collector ->----- -> Village sarpanch. 1.	Let Village Sarpanch report how many unskilled youth is actually residing in his village. 2.	And what actions are being taken. 3.	Who are teaching them. 4.	No of people who are not taking part. 5.	Etc. Pls do make somebody accountable.
6 0 #Surajya (3/n)In remote area still youth are unaware about it. They till date do not know what “Skill India” scheme is or govt is more curious about enhancing their life. If this things can’t be eradicated than money of ours to skill youth will definitely be utilized even substantially. Pls do take necessary steps to improve over this situation. Here I would like to suggest one mode: Collector ->----- -> Village sarpanch.
8 0 #sURAJYA(2/N) 2. Skill India: Everybody is making their eye for its success. Failure of this scheme if there definitely India will have to pay a heavy cost. There is no doubt India’s literacy is increasing but unemployment is increasing at faster rate. Well hare what a think till date govt has failed to incorporate this scheme effectively. I have gone thru the pattern of implementation of this scheme by govt, this scheme needs more attention, marketing from govt side.
15 0 Dear Mr. Prime Minister, the hard work out in by you is worth appreciation but a common man is still not relieved of problems relating to basic needs of life so do something more urgently
8 1 #Surajya Dear Sir, What i am perceiving in society at present time, I would like to strongly recommend the following suggestions for improving the existing schemes: 1. "Swachha Bharat" a distinguished and definitely its our fundamental right to get desirable environment: While every citizen of India wishes for its success but fact of the matter is that nobody wants to contribute towards this willingly. According to my perception this scheme should have been linked to Panchayat or Municipali
13 2 India needs more railway tracks to increase trains,speed. the existing tracks are over loaded. We need more trains for reliable and good service, to move the economy. It is suggested that instead of a Bullet train we use the fund or ask the Japanese government to add new tracks which will allow more public to use, increase the average speed to 150, reliable signalling system better. How many people will be able to afford bullet train. Instead use same fund we  may be able to lay 1200 Kilometer.
1 0 my suggestion is to make more transparent public friendly information system. more Focus on to save nature means start 'tree festival', Bio diversity Festival, Health and Sanitation awarness programs , Energy awareness festivals etc
3 0 #Surajya Girls pursuing Masters in Economics should be placed at a very respectable position (dream of RBI Governor Mr.Raghuram Rajan) will come true.India desperately needs good economist and female in economics (SONE PE SUHAGA)
3 0 #Surajya To generate effective investment,household saving should be encouraged. RBI Tax Free Bonds for senior citizens should be reintroduced. Further rising pollution in major cities like Delhi is matter of great concern. Environment tax on medium and large cars, SUVs should be progressively imposed- 20-60 per cent of list price of car. Price differential should be imposed on price of fuel for big cars and SUVs. Pollutants should pay more.
1 0 #Surajya, #GoodGovernanceDay, #MyGov In most polluted metros of India only EURO-VI(BS6)compliant vehicles should be registered.Till they are manufactured in India such engines and Euro-VI compliant petrol/diesel should be imported from other countries so that air pollution level can be controlled with out Odd Even formula.
2 0 Hon'ble Prime Minister Narendra Modiji. It is my request to you to change the name of our country at international level from India to Bharat. The reason is, when Britishers when conquered America, the native of that land were Red Indians and we at East of Britain are similar to Red Indians, hence they came to our land with name of East India Company. This means we are also inferior like Red Indians in America. Hence should change the name of our country from India to Bharat internationally.
3 0 # Surajya... Late but not the least. 'Mygov' is itself, a very nice platform made by the present govt. It can help the govt to get public opinions and ideas on any issue. I see India powered by billion brains. We all together can make change, We can be develop, prosperous and smart nation with conserving our sociocultural and bio-ecological diversity.
4 0 Based on the OBJECTIVES OF SURAJYA , government can integrate all the people who working for the same purpose and give a platform in every field with IT SUPPORT LIKE THIS FORUM . for an example to kill corruption many NGO has been working ,govt must integrate those ideas through brainstorming in a continuous manner and find way to implement it. governance should be on process focused and outcome oriented , MANY YOUNG PEOPLE READY TO WORK FOR NATION CAN USE THE FORUM IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR FIELD
1 0 For better rural development,speedy services to the common man and corruption less environment intermediate systems like zila parishad and panchayat samitee should be removed.It will save a huge money which can be utilised for other beneficial development projects.
1 1 #Surajya is inclusive development for the main street. In this direction, one has to keep in mind subsidies for poor should continue, exemptions for rich should be scrapped. It is surprising, that social security for the main street is insignificant compared to counterparts in developed countries.High unemployment rate among the educated youth is distressing. To generate effective investment to generate jobs, there is a need to encourage household savings.

0 0 Sir utilization of New Delhi-Airport Express line can be increased by reducing the fare upto other Delhi Metro line fares and allowing the usual DMRC smart cards on this line.If its utilization is increased, road traffic towards Dhaula Kuan will reduce,air pollution level will go down, and odd even formula would be better implemented.
0 0 Sir New Delhi-Airport Express line was commissioned to serve high end passengers to and from airport but this metro line has failed to serve its declared purpose. Its capacity is not fully utilized and is running under capacity. Reason being very high passenger fare. It means wastage of public money/investment. Its utilization can be increased by reduc

1 0 #Surajya- Swacch Bharat Abhiyan (SBA) was a good initiative that created a sense of feeling to the implementer that they are involved in a nation pride activity. Efforts should be enhanced to make the activity percolate into majority of population through various innovative methodologies. Preparing SBA Sainiks in every unit area to create awareness on the aspects of SBA and recognizing the efforts of sanitation workers by various means shall drive the attention of majority people over it.

Because India never signing except ideality. We are always with Swamiji and Netaji , so we don't think about our development. We love our country , for success.
0 0 Sir, As per my view Surajya is one other good name of Ramrajya. For launching the Concept of Surajya in India it should be necessory to make accountablity measures for everyone for his /her job like country of Japan/China & good Corporate house. This Concept Should be Start with a bunch of Reward/Punishment as per need like govt apply approach in Kala Dhan. Surajya concept is need of Time for better India. Regards, Arun Singh from world oldest living holy city varanasi.
0 0 Sir, #Surajya is not only about good governance, it also should be about healthy & secure living for all. The Insurance & Pensions schemes, Swachch Bharat Abhiyan & Beti Bachao Beti padao schemes are a step in the right direction. Though the path to achieving our goal is difficult, consistent effort in this direction is warranted. The last year has seen public awakening due to the visionary SBA of PM Modi and "Clean India" campaigns are taking place led by youngsters, a praise worthy effort.

0 0 Sir, for #Surajya to become the norm, education will have to be the foundation. It is time to bring in quality control into our education system. "Jugaad" should not be allowed here too. A degree with no knowledge will serve no purpose to the individual or the country. Skill training, employability, basic management techniques & e-ventures should be part of the course in all institutions. Eligibility criteria, course structure & graduation norms have to be uniform with e-education gaining ground
0 0 #Surajya  (4)Brief intro for all state and central government schemes send via voice sms on weekly basis at a particular time. (5) Provide a system where any Indian Citizen can register via voice sms one unresolved problem for advice bimonthly.
0 0 Sir, #Surajya should be about participatory governance. For this, a mature, enlightened & evolved polity is needed along with a streamlined political system. Responsive & accountable bureaucracy should act as a bridge between the two. Though career diplomats are the norm, isn't it time to bring in trained & experienced citizens with domain knowledge to be an add on to the governance paradigm. Also, should there not be a training program for aspiring politicians to gain insight into governance.
0 0 #Surajya  Let us focus on five basic things for the year 2016 to achieve  complete SURAJYA at the earliest: (1 )All Indians should have Aadhar card. No Indian should be left out.  (2)  Make it very easy for any Indian to register birth and death to maintain most accurate aadhar database.  (3) Ensure all Indians do have mobiles with internet facility and their mobile number updated in Aadhar system.
1 0 #Surajya Gold monetization scheme launched needs marketing. Its a good scheme to improve CAD and save valuable foreign exchange. Melting of Jewelry is highly sentimental issue which needs to be addressed in a tactful manner. Otherwise Congress as usual will exploit politically as Modi ji will now take out Mangal sutra of housewives.The melting centers to be  public convenient and trust worthy. The MMTC can play a lead role in this process. The target of the Govt should be 4 big temples.

1 0 Sir, going forward #Surajya requires better outreach, utilisation & accountability of resources for which e-governance will be imperative. The digital India program with its many schemes, especially "digital locker" will be of great help in reducing paper work & improving access to facilities by all. More needs to be done to familiarise people to the digital access system. Integrating Aadhar with state health facilities will lead to a significant improvement in health access for all.
0 0 #Surajya This suggestion is regarding Swachh Bharat: 1) Create/Certify micro-organizations that take up group initiatives for cleanup activities across India. They can be Govt. or private (non-profit) but a trustable org. 2) Encourage volunteering from citizens by providing perks to the volunteers such as rebate in Tax, concessions in rail/bus travel. If I participate more, I get more benefits. Involve more citizens for a clean and green India
0 0 #Surajya - Addressing the knowledge gap in farmers in a more amicable manner. The lower productivity per unit area of Agri and Allied sector products compared to some of the countries can be attributed mainly to the gap in the knowledge on package of practices at various growth stages. This humanly controlled factor should be addressed by by all means immediately exploring and implementing practically possible, tailor made, farmer friendly solutions that can be readily acceptable by him/her.

My point would be to throw lights on Pvt Sector companies where mass injustice is being done to employees regarding their compensation,exploited to work long working hours and forced to work in off days for which no compensation is provided.Can you do something sir??
0 0 # Surajya 1. Existing programs are excellent, more awareness, proper monitoring and control is required 2. Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan - Enactment of a comprehensive legislation will prove very effective - Introduce as a proper discipline for Studies at School, College, University levels - Rural areas - toilets being built - polluting ground water (proper guidance is required), involvement of Panchayats, vigilante groups, NGOs to promote the usage of toilets Regards, Rajkaran Singh Bhatti
0 0 Swaraj with accountability, responsibility & vision for the future leads to #Surajya. The Jan Dhan Yojana has been a game changer along with Aadhar to improve financial inclusivity, accountability of subsidy disbursal & responsive citizenry. In the recent Chennai floods, the JDY account & Aadhar were immensely useful to many to establish identity & receive assistance. Pan India integration of the two schemes will lead to better resource mobilisation & utilisation.

0 0 #SURAJYA Modiji can we conduct an event of TREE PLANTATION on a large scale. But this time involving large number of people just like SWACHH BHARAT. Planting areas should be marked by offcials and seeds esp fruit plant seeds should be distributed among people. Even if 50% of India's population plants trees,once a month,India's tree cover will increase drastically. Convincing video clips about climate change should be telecasted on regular intervals or should be made compulsory for students.

1 0 Respected Sir, there are many traffic diversions,one ways,detours etc. in India. Most of them have not been scientifically designed resulting in huge wastage of fuel and time. A classic example is detour of 1/2 km taken by east bound buses exiting Broadway bus stand in Chennai which can be easily avoided by an opening in median opposite exitgate and posting a policeman there. Hence a scientific study of all traffic arrangements may be taken up nationwide and revised to save fuel and time.

With absolutely no mistake on her side due to a banking issue a wrong amount(1,68,575/- instead of 5595/-) was debited from account while making a PF payment for employees. While it took us great efforts in establishing that it was infact debited from the account,It was acknowledged that there was a billdesk issue.

To make honest citizens of our precious children and to root out corruption, moral  education must be made compulsory for all students up to masters level and the marks should count for passing.
1 0 #Surajya is when the brave sons and daughters of India that protect our borders given the respect they deserve. I list out some of the points that should be considered in the attached document.
1 0 As an incentive to save, each depositor in a bank should be insured upto a maximum of Rs.10 lakhs for both principal and interest amount held by him/her in the same capacity and same right as on the date of liquidation/cancellation of bank's licence or the date on which the scheme of amalgamation/merger/reconstruction comes into force. The present limit of 1 lakh is too less. This will boost depositor as well as investor’s confidence.
1 0 In my opinion, #surajya means to develop the country in a sustainable manner. Swatch Bharat mission is really good initiative. But the main aim doesn't seem to be propagated among public. So, try to spread it in more elaborated form.
0 0 Govt should remove subsidy from canteen for MPs in Parliament as MPs are not power and they can afford the market price for what they eat
2 0 There are latrines constructed in villages but water supply is not there Hence these can not be used. Till water supply is available, it is suggested that Community latrine should be constructed and water supply given there through bore wells and solar lights
0 0 )Good Governance also means that Govt should not go for un-necessary litigation's and well settled law by Apex Court should be implemented without further litigation. In one case, SC had dismissed SLP atleast 4 to 5 times on same point of law(Ignoring of Non Communicated Below benchmark ACRs ) but Govt/ DOPT is still not implementing it and old persons are not getting relief. When Modi Govt came to Power, I was under the impression that things would improve but the attitude of Govt does not seem
1 0 first and foremost, the air we breath should be pollution free in a #surajya. and for this all the 3 levels of govt should take extra efforts.i would suggest our govt to take up a #myindia#greenindia initiative where it includes afforestation as its prime objective and schemes to encourage each and every citizens to plant trees for a healthy life.
1 0 #Surajya While I am hopeful of the government bringing on the change in the next fe years, I would like point some good practices and shortcomings I have experienced this year. Good : positive and quick responses on grieveance redressals at rashtrapati Bhavan and National museum Need to Improve: While the govt is vigorously promoting its flagship Swatch Bharat Abhiyan, I find the provisions for achieving it is lacking. No trashbins are seen in Delhi Metro stations in and around.
5 0 The Swachh Bharath campaign is one of the best initiatives. Yes, it might take a lot of time for India to be clean. But to bring such a mindset, itself is a big deal. However, they're discouraged when they don't find a dustbin in public places and are compelled to throw it around. However, even if dustbins are placed, there are times that even dustbins get stolen! Hence, the Govt is requested to work towards a practical solution.
1 0 tips for swatch bharath: most tourist movement in Railways can be used local collage students to join as volunteers to penalize to citizens how some people misusing environment of Railway stations and destroy all work done by housekeeping cleanliness. There are some people never support until we enforce them to pay fine for throwing waste n urinating and many more which is illegal as per act.
1 0 In my opinion, our country should be beggar free. Please ban all types of begging and rehabilitate these people.  And as far as my understanding,  a big mafia is behind this.According to me,  if a country has beggars means it's the failure of the govt system where it is unable to take care of all types of citizens.  And also there are cases of forcing people to begging.  So a formal ban should be posed and make these people rehabilitated and make them also part and accountable to the system.
1 0 #GoodGovernanceDay, Good Governance is now taking shape in most of the field of the governance, this pace may be accelerated through the involvement of the lower and middle strata of the machinery.
1 0 Dear Sir, In your Independence Day speech, you said that corruption in India is like termite in home & asked for citizens' participation. I have tried to uncover corruption in BSNL, which can single-handedly derail Digital India & Skill India missions. I also wrote to PMO's Grievance Redressal but nothing happened & the matter was closed without any action. It appears that bureaucrats & government officers have mastered the art of delaying & denying. But people expect more from you. Thanks.
0 0 Good Governance cannot b achieved without Good Public Partnership Need of hour is 2 recognise our responsibilities & Bring home SuRajya & its Benefits for betterment of coming generations As teacher: educating students in concerned subject should b accompanied by their proper Behaviour & Attitude Disapproving malpractices in Examination & Jobs is also part of my job Imparting Skills so that they remain Confident &Live Dignified is my achievement Cleanliness brings Positivity & SelfRespectRegards
1 0 Our government system divided between administration level of Center, State, District, City, Village and between semi govt, special purpose vehicle, pradhikaran. Common man faces difficulty in dealing with such system where govt departments are loosely connected and lacking integration. #Surajya should change the way system functions in past, it should start new era where “Citizen will deal with government as One Team” #GoodGovernanceDay #MyGov
0 0 Digital India mission must be the top priority to achieve goals of #Surajya. Through Pimpri Chinchwad Citizen Forum (PCCF) we have written consultation paper on Digital City. Digital world is just a supportive factor to make your Real world easy, happy & joyful. Read here https://goo.gl/WpZRSy (language Marathi) #GoodGovernanceDay #MyGov #DigitalIndia #SmartCity
1 0 I is to be noted that despite so much of advertising, there are only 361 responses only. May be people do not want to use this and this is one way communication. There is lot to do, in each field. So much governance vacuum and gap in governance delivery. Little change. Expectations were very high with Modi ji.
1 0 I think solid waste management requires immediate attention. It is an area which can be the golden goose of this era. Waste management is linked to a lot of other fields: Climate change/environment, agriculture, manufacturing, services, households, employment, research & development, Rural & urban development, cheaper resources, Swachh Bharath and what not!#Surajya
2 0 In #Surajya citizen must get four dimensional helpline system consisting 1) Right to Service 2) Right to Information 3) Grievance Redressal 4) Collaboration. System should be accessible through all communication medium, cost effectively and without any discrimination. Good to see Maharastra adopted this model, check here https://aaplesarkar.maharashtra.gov.in #GoodGovernanceDay #MyGov
2 0 #Sugam means hassle free access is essential for #Surajya. If we look at online services then many things has drastically changed at Center & State level but our cities (ULB) are not up to mark. Their online services downgraded in terms of effectiveness, security, look & feel (GUI). It happened due to lack of vision, management skills at ULB level. Center/State should intervene at ULB level to make their all online services simple, user friendly, secure, uniform #GoodGovernanceDay #MyGov
1 0 National Pension Scheme - Is very helpful sir. BUT AGE LIMIT 40 YEARS is a concerns. There are many people in age group of 40-45 yrs who are deprived of secured jobs and they are certainly going to struggle in their old age. So I sincerely request our PM to increase eligibility for NPS Scheme to cover age at least upto 45 yrs.
0 0 If we start listing out govt past success stories then SARATHI helpline system will definitely stand at top. Developed by then commissioner Dr Shrikar Pardeshi (IAS) for Pimpri-Chinchwad city. Dr. Pardeshi currently serving PMO as a director. SARATHI model should be adopted in #Surajya. Click this link to know more about SARATHI http://goo.gl/DpzAZd #GoodGovernanceDay #MyGov
0 0 #Surajya @MyGovIndia Longevity of outputs and sustainability of efforts with respect to the excellent initiatives we are having are the grey areas that India should seriously looked into. It has to be inbuilt into our personal, social and professional lives. It should become the greatest social reform in the 21st century.
3 0 Indian railways that is among worlds largest shud focuss and check more on 'Goods delivery'..and shuld take it seriously..Alongwith this there is an enormous increase in  'passenger looting' even in AC compatment, so do check it too.
0 0 4. Idea 4 of 10 Small ideas (benefit large population with small steps) Issue a circular that all the data entered by citizens through any eGovernance portal or application should data entry in three languages - two other than English. Due to software limitations, large software companies are only providing English labels and data entry only in English. This is a big drawback for citizens who does not know English. Further, government staff encounters challenges of owning translation.
0 0 Modi Sarkar has focused on holistic & long term structural improvements in the sector, with a focus on achieving 24X7 power for all #Surajya Coal India hs produced more coal in 2014-15 then last four yrs combined.As a consequence, imports plummeted 49% in Nov vs last year #Surajya Crisis arising fm cancellation of 214 coal blocks by Hon’ble SC was turned into an opportunity through transparent e-auctions #Surajya
2 0 All the competitive exams should b made mandatorily ONLINE.. And marks of all the candidates shuld b posted online..So that recruitment becomes transparent and much faithful. Thanks for noticing.
1 0 Complete mismatch between demand and supply and lack of long term planning in the sector resulted in acute regional power shortages #Surajya Distribution malice ws spread across the entire power sector, with Power Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) haemorrhaging with losses.#Surajya
0 0 Such darkness engulfed the nation, even as more than 24K MW of generation capacity lay idle due to lack of fuel like coal & gas #Surajya Rs.1.86 lakh crore coal scam virtually froze decision making in the sector. As a result, last yr as many as 2/3 of coal based #Surajya power plants (66 out of 100 coal plants tracked by CEA) were having critical coal stocks meaning less than 7 days of coal stock Surajya

0 0 3. Idea 3 of 10 - small ideas, benefits to large number of people All cooperative societies are required to audit their accounts under cooperative society act. In most cases, accountants are performing this task and then auditor stamps it. In that process, society pays sum of Rs. 6000 with no benefit to society or to state. Introduce software solution (on similar lines as introduced by IT department for individuals) and introduce mandatory audits for societies with budgets exceeding 1 Cr.
0 0 2.	What can we do on global warming?  We should use solar energy(Cochin air port is the world’s 1st air port in this category), why can’t we think of houses in India running with solar energy, and if government is liable to supply power only for institutions, and if we develop more and more precise models of solar panels in India and if LED lights are used for lighting including them(solar panel and LED lights) in the “make in India” programme, we are able to work only with hydel projects.

0 0 Friends what is #Surajya ? In simple terms Surajya means Good Governance Lokmanya Tilak had said "स्वराज्य हा माझा जन्मसिद्ध हक्क आहे आणि तो मी मिळवणारच" ("Swarajya is my birthright, and I shall have it ) #Surajya In 2014 we Indians said सुराज्य हमारा जन्मसिद्ध हक्क है (Good Governance is my birthright) & we elected #MITOA @narendramodi as PM #Surajya What better than Power Sector to discuss #Surajya of this government
0 0 2. Small ideas - idea 2 of 10 (benefiting large population with small improvements) Many railway stations have retiring rooms. While Railways have introduced online bookings for these facilities, it is booked for a day with high charges. Most uneducated never take benefit of these facilities. Instead sell retiring room facilities as ticket on the ticket  counters in a batch of two hours. This period is sufficient for small families to take bath and move forward to pilgrimage.
1 0 According to me POLICE should have a minimum fitness level like ARMY jawans.We often see polices,after getting their job does not bother to maintain their physique at all.So their must be a mandatory phisical ability critrea for them to atleast chase down any snachers or thives without sitting around with their big belly and taking bribes from citizens like us.PLEASE MAKE THEM FIT FROM NOT ONLY BY THEIR  BODY BUT ALSO FROM THEIR MIND.
0 0 I am proposing ten little steps that government can take that will benefit large number of citizens. 1 Idea 1 of 10 Let form 15 submission for bank fixed deposits be one time activity while opening/ renewing fixed deposits for senior citizens/ housewives. Filing form 15H at banks has been a routine ritual practiced in month of April. All bank managers will swear the difficulties faced by senior citizens in understanding, filing the form and making compulsory two trips to bank.

1 0 Need Government Schools Education needs to improved a lot. Payscale of gov teachers are lot better and very good job security then of private schools teacher but the students of government schools are really poor at its education can't even compare with private schools. This need to be improved a lot. If needy/poor get good education then no one ever need to give any thing they by them self lead their life with complete Dignity, Peace and Power. #GoodEducation
0 0 #surajya   The launch of App MERI SADAK will enable people's participation in infrastructural projects, reduce corruption & speed up processes.
0 0 #GoodGovernanceDay  For Education, I suggest the following: The education department should use the Aadhar ID of each student or use a student ID that is used for ever. There will be a portal where each student will have his own page. All the results of the students are uploaded just like we upload Form 16. All certificates of the student during his education are also uploaded here. This will avoid fake certificates, and also enable companies 2 get a validated data.

0 0 #Surajya,#GoodGovernanceDay,#MyGov The GoI encourages give and take of ideas by spending on organizing Symposia, Seminars, Conferences. If this expenditure is cut down to half, the remaining half funds can be diverted to the welfare of farmers and the needy sections of the society. A lot can be done for actual development.
0 0 #GoodGovernanceDay For Women empowerment, I suggest the following: A mobile wallet along with mobile is given by Govt to women and girls. All the funds given to the women and girls such as for education or health are routed through this wallet. For instance if a girl goes to school, she can pay the fees using wallet where she needs to mention the account person the wallet id. By having wallet the fund utilization can be controlled. Only challenge is to see how to provide the smart phone

2 0 #Surajya Thanks for the power provided to us in participating Governments decision making process. True #Surajya will achieved only when every citizen in our country able to participate. Digital India is ideal process to achieve it. #DigitalDivide and teenage cybercrimes are biggest problem our nation facing today. As a Nation we provide least importance to Adult education. People above 30 find difficult learn latest tools , "One Library Per Village" ideal solution for continuous learning #MyGov
2 0 FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR #SURAJYA I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY GOVT SCHEMES AND WORKS SPECIALLY FOR GIRLS AGAIN THANKU,BUT THEIR IS SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO ASK ? YOU ARE SAYING SAVE GIRL CHILD ,EDUCATE THEM BUT IN MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES AFTER THEY GET EDUCATED THEN THESE GIRLS ARE SELLED YES SELLED BY A SO CALLED TRADITION DOWRY AND FROM HERE THE LIFE OF A GIRL STARTS RUNING ,FIRSTLY HIS FATHER HAD TO STRUGGLE FOR 50 LAKHS ,THEN HIS HUSBAND STARTS DEMANDING GIVE IT UP PLZ STOP THIS TRADITION
1 0 #Surajya,#GoodGovernanceDay,#MyGov The GoI gives so much of funds for the running of its various Ministries and their Departments. It is good. What are the returns? To ensure proper utilisation of funds, employees should prove their efficiency. Holding an Officer responsible even when his subordinates are inefficient is wrong. Efficiency should be monitored at every level. Methods must be devised to measure employee efficiency.
0 0 #Surajya For Health , I suggest the following: A mobile application authorized by the govt it launched. During epidemics or for prevention such as Dengue or swine flu, the govt broadcasts the details on this app. The app will give access to patients about the clinics they can visit, once detected with the disease, they can just click " Need Help". There will be a command center which will automatically route the patient to the hospital. Provide him the support he needs. It is a centralized sol
2 0 Sir #Surajya Bharat needs Education for All in Coming Two Years, Establish low cost Primary Schools in all backwards areas,mohallas for improving literacy rate among the indian citizens. We are way back compared to many countries in World literacy percentages , Srilanka 91%, Uruguay,Guana,Brazil,Columbia,Mexico,Suriname etc all 90% above. To achieve 100% literacy with human values, a Swami Vivekananda Primary School System need to be established in all required zones of country.
1 0 Citizens who have given prime time &energy for the country, when faced with post retirement harassment should not feel helpless given PG Redressal. However, without resolving the pensioner’s grievance (P&PW/W/2010/00713)to get pension payment in authorized bank of pensioner’s choice,grievance was arbitrarily closed after 4 years by Dept of Pension & Pensioner’s Welfare. When issue was raised via RTI, a new complaint number was created. Is this effective way to resolve Public Grievance?
0 0 #Surajya For Cleanliness, I suggest the following: Instead of advertisement boards, now companies can take a given area and maintain its cleanliness, by beautifying it like growing grass, waste is kept neatly and closed, the place will have the hoarding of that company. This way both the purposes will be solved. It will also give employment to people. The municipality can decide the areas.This can be further organized by having some companies sponsor for vehicles to take waste etc.
0 0 I wish to suggest our Prime Minister to request all Indian Railways employees to give up their free pass to travel in train with their families. Like give up LPG Subsidy campaign Give Up free Rail pass will help our nation to recover from the loss incurred by Railways Department.When they are willing to charge kids under age 12 for the berth, they must also come forward to pay for their tickets.
0 0 Pranaams #Surajya Bharat Needs Strict Ban on Alcohol consumption in Public places like Parks, Gardens, Bus stations, Driving cabins, Government Secretariats, Police stations,Electricity offices, R&B Ministerial Bunglaws, Beaches etc. A National Level Law should be made in this regard. Any person caught, or complaint came he should be removed from Govt service permanently if proved. The Alcoholism has becoming a National Disease in all sectors. Except Five star Hotels ,all places Ban it.

Please post a message regarding the Activities Points.

1 0 Achieving the mammoth task of constructing 4,25,000 toilets in 2,62,000 toilets across India in one year is a major milestone. Swachh Vidyalaya initiative by Ministry of Human Resource Development has set an example how time-bound targets can be achieved efficiently. Formation of Web Portal with Single Stop Integrated IT Solution for accomplishing the goal of 100% gender-specific toilets in schools has proved how technology combined with efficient ground work pave way for #Surajya.
1 0 If you really have positive attitude towards gov then u can feel the change in terms of cleanliness, railway etc. But we still need strong crime control & timely justice. For this we strongly needa ssystem to complaint against the administrative officials without disclosing identity of complainers to maintain transparency & the investigating officer should also be accountable & in this way complaint should go to higher level even upto PM till full satisfaction of the complainers.
0 0 #Surajya Make Helmets and seat belts/airbags mandatory. No relaxation on the basis of religion. Campaigns like #NohelmetNoInsurance can be launched and police should be asked to issue spot challans without fail. Same for Number plates.. Press vehicles to be registered by media house so that arm wrestling by people having PRESS sticker pasted on their vehicles stop. Ambulances with patients should have more priority than MP/MLA/CM/PM cavalcade and that too withut negligence
2 0 Clause7.3(c)Grievance Redress Mechanism in Government by Department of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances should be strictly followed, specially by  Ministry of Personnel,Public Grievances and Pensions, who responded opposite on 21/12/15 for RTI- “forward to respective ministries we do not have any time limit prescribed the reason being that the grievances are diverse in nature and each may require different time limit and is thus left to the public grievance officer of the ministry.."

0 0 For making Varanasi  a  smart city industrial development should be taken place. young business man who want to grow and take part in corporate social responsibility in VARANASI should be given chance to develop Varanasi. WIFI facility should be provided at reasonable rate. Self employment should be started in VARANASI.
0 0 Surajya can not be come in its real spirit until and unless empowerment of the poor and the last man of the country.the two very good policies and scheme has been given by the government to empower the poor, the two insurance scheme which will give them the social security. but it is unfortunate to say that these schemes is not advertised properly all across through the country and a huge amount of people is still do not know about the policies and schemes.
0 0 #Surajya Please take a relook at the proposed hike in MP salaries. It should be based on the productivity of these MPs. Fixed salary should be reduced and performance based variables like % of funds allocated utilised for public benefit, implementation of central govt schemes, productive attendance in the houses (Upper or lower), key initiatives
1 0 I want discuss about water wastage in India.in our houses,in society water wastage happen in front of us.like while washing hand or face some people keep tap fully open.istead of this we can open tab half or close till face get wash with soap or whatever you are using and open again when you want wash face with water.this the one thing only.walso I will suggest to ban on sencer are getting used in bathrooms of corporate offices and malls This is also big water wastage point.so save water.thanks
0 0 #Surajya Please ensure that the trees are not cut in residential areas and the parks meant for children and the old alike are not not given away as Banquet halls. There is no fresh air or place to relax in these concrete colonies.
2 0 Government must help the citizens to report any crime, illegal activities, corruption related issues through a separate portal.This will help a lot to minimise the impact.Now there is no such feature.Citizens are not aware about complaining to the concerned higher officials directly by mail. An acknowledgement mail must be sent to the sender and  action has to be taken by the officials sincerely. Then only India will become a power nation and grow.
1 0 #Surajya Give the gift of Dual Citizenship to overseas Indians. Former Prime Minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, had promised dual citizenship in 2003 and former Attorney General, Soli Sorabjee, stated in 2005 “If we want to involve the diaspora, then we can’t deny them the right to vote or the right to occupy important office.” Dual citizenship can have a positive impact on remission of funds to the homeland and strengthens ties and commitment to causes in the country of origin. #GoodGovernanceDay
0 0 #surajya railways have made incredible progress and development. i believe through the following below comments that the government has taken many more steps for the development. but more than half of them is unknown to the general public. pls do something so that all the steps is made known to the public.
0 0 I would like to suggest to scrap free pass system for Railways employees and their families. Charging kids to travel in train is not a good initiative. When the Railways employees get good salary why they need free travel pass?All students must be allowed to travel freely in trains throughout India.The executives who suggested to charge children must come forward to scrap the free pass scheme to its employees immediately. This will only help to save the loss.
1 0 I am very enthusiastic about the my gov portal and participate regularly in the competitions, open discussion and polls . But the acceptance of entries and results of all these competitions are delayed and are not announced in a transparent manner . And grievances in this regard are also not addressed properly. All this should be fixed so that citizens are encouraged to participate.
0 0 #Surajya Which type of Surajya we want ? Public is paying Tax for Public welfare but what Government does with this money ? A big game of taxation and subsidy is there. Now everything is being taxed and afterwards subsidized Why not directly Tax Free where ever subsidy is provided like fuel. Let common public know how much tax they are paying for the comfort of VIPs. They are working hard to make rich politicians, industrialists, intelectuals, beurocrates and so called Media Personnels
1 0 Recently, I traveled in the train, Cleaning toilets with compressed air and water was implemented in the coaches.Nice initiative. Suggestion: During the cleaning with high pressure, the water splashes on to the seats and people around including children. If they use any barricade that would stop the splashes. Problem in train: Maintenance:Switches are missing,the fans are dirty,some are not working.A/C coach Bed sheets, pillow covers are covered with papers, these are thrown down.Need Bins.
0 0 Continue..the process within 15 months. Some corrupted officer are arrested in passport office in Assam when someone write it to Pm.This kind of attitude close government and common people and it's defined as surajya.
2 0 my suggestions are 1-elimination of corruption at basic level will give relief to a common man, which can be substantially reduced by surprise visit of highly powered team of very unconcerned fellows. This team has right to take which is not questionable-at court.
0 0 One of the most important issue in my mind is to aware common people so that civic sense may be promoted in the society. Government may polarize through advertisements (using actors/cricketers/.. and country is first and later all other boundaries.
0 0 #Surajya: I was happy that many of the suggestions given by me in the Railways group on MyGov portal were taken up by the government. The launching of Young Professionals program by the NITI Ayog for professionals from different streams of education to work on various policies and programs of Government of India including research work was also laudable. It should by launched again at the earliest. However, the age limit should be increased from 32 to 35 years.
2 0 #Surajya Now a days there is too much crime mostly on women. It cant be decrease only putting criminals in jail only. For that we have to try to give better education with social and cultural values too. If today's children got good education and belief than we will sure that future India definitely  very good. For that in schools from 1 to 12th there must be a subject which teach our child how to take care of our country how respect girls, how a good country became all good points we have teach
0 0 sir,to achieve the #Surajya first thing we will have to do is - to separate the development from politics, until we do it ,we can't even imagine surajya.
1 0 #Surajya: Year 2015 was a milestone year for the Indian Railways. A lot was achieved in terms of cleanliness of railway stations, providing many types of information through SMS, induction of new coaches with swanky and user friendly design and CCTV Cameras, food on demand etc. Many projects announced by the Railway Minister in Railway Budget 2015 is yet to take shape e.g. providing Tablets to TTE's, sattelite based monitoring of unmanned railway crossings etc. I hope these are launched in 2016.
0 0 #surajya. We often hear man ki bat of our "kings"(policy maker of government) in radio,television and it reflects on their policy's,but I believe surajya is that when man ki bat of common people hear the policy makers and act.Example.. I am an innovator from Assam ,my innovation is applied for patent from NIF in 2008 and request for examination in 2011. I notice that to grant a patent in India its take a long period of 6-8 years and I so I wrote to pmo,they take the step and decided to complete

0 0 #Surajya In the medical sector we need stricter medical laws which will hold Doctors or medical personnel responsible for any failure in treatment of the patient and in case of the death of the patient the entire money spend on the treatment of the patient would be refunded back to the patient party.

0 0 Respected Sir, to ensure proper quality, the quality control of the construction projects of both central and state governments and public institutions may be entrusted to institutions like I.I.T.s, I.I.M.s etc. Up to 1% of the project cost may be spent for quality control. The details of scope, entrustment, compliance etc. of the quality control mechanism may be worked out by a team of experts. I am suggesting this as the already existing mechanism for quality control seems ineffective.
0 0 #Surajya It has been found that many big corporate companies have huge Cash in Hand under the head Cash balance if Government can introduce the restriction of making Cash payments for big corporate houses then they will no longer need to maintain huge Cash balance which will result in inflow of un utilized cash into banks and eventually increased the GDP GROWTH.It will increase money flow in the systems resulting in cheaper interest rates.

This will encourage more people to surrender the subsidy,as the availing or non-availing of the subsidy will become visible and noticeable to all,playing on both moral and snob values of the society.

0 0 Dear sir,the best initiatives are usually the ones taken keeping the poorest beneficiaries in mind.So,an important step to be taken by the government for the coming years is the implementation of a SERVICE GUARANTEE ACT in all government departments which ensures delivery of services within 15 days at the least and 25 days at the maximum.If services are not delivered,a penalty amount would be deducted from the concerned official until it is done.This one step can single-handedly change India.

1 0 #surajya Sir I suggest to make a national platform for missing persons. Generally the attitude of the police for first few days are non cooperative, considering that the missing person will come back on his own. Whereas this time is very crucial. On this platform, the information of missing persons can be updated by the relatives on realtime basis. The police stations/ Public can update the details of missing persons found in their area. This will be of great help for the grieved family.

So it is very important that it is ensured that changes are evident on ground. And as I said in past, perception is becoming negative about the government. Platform like Mann Ki Baat should be used to send correct messages. Currently it appears to be lost in normal chit chat. I understand that is how PM Modi has envisaged it, but when the media is so dead against and are spreading negative news, government will have to ensure a counter.

If such platform is provided a voter would be more empowered while selecting their MP. It will increase the accountability and create a healthy competition among the MP and would help in nation building.
0 0 Sad to see parliament session being washed out and GST not being passed. Do we need to relook at democracy as a form of Govt ? Will the people of India see their dreams being fulfilled ?
0 0 One of the important premise of GST; is avoiding double taxation, by giving input tax credit to intermediate dealers. However the Sales Tax departments view it as a concession given to the dealer at the discretion of the department; rather than his right. They simply disallow the credit, with retrospective effect, if the dealer at previous stage is defaulter. This is most unfair practice and should be avoided in administration of GST. Penalty for defaulters only, should be the norm.

This mentality is most prevalent in Police department. When they deal with public; their view is unless proved otherwise, the person in front of them is a crook. other departments carry same view at varying degrees. All of them have to understand that they are 'Service providers' paid by public.

I have written to authorities on various issues but only very few have been taken to logical conclusion. Most of the complaints are not moving from central repository. I request the ministry to check the way of working & bring professional people to run the department with daily reports of backlogs & statistics. #Surajya

There are poor sanitation and no electricity in Bhowara-malahtoli Kantahi -Madhubani . A hemlate dominated by lower caste.. Lalu and Nitish just cheated them.

Tribal Sub-Plan should be implemented in letter and spirit for the tribals to develop along with their counterparts in rural and urban areas. Lack of Transparency and Information is dampening the spirit of empowering tribals leading to internal wars with its own people.

0 0 To achieve Surajya, we have to follow transparency and accountability, I am quoting here an example ,application of Dr Sheetal Malhotra MD Transfusion Medicine was not entertained under  OPH category against Post of Asstt.

Health Ministry    and UPSE consider it as suitable post other the identified post for PWD.PGIMER Chandigarh lacks transparent mechanism which is a hurdle in achieving SURAJYA.

1 0 #Surajya The Black money law aims at only curbing the huge sums. What about the day-to-day transactions like payment to cabbies etc.? All the money is unaccounted for. The concept of digital wallet must receive solid backing by the Government; it can include most day-to-day transactions which will account every rupee spent. This will ensure that black money is curbed at the individual level too. The Government may provide special schemes / incentives to start-ups which focus on digital wallets.
0 0 Look at the number of murders taking place all around, not by terrorist.  In the civil society ,people are not bothered about law  of the land.  Its all set up. Corrupt system of majority of the society being corrupt, police , politician , judiciary nexus. Murderers are noy caught. They surrender  to their choice of police man, get bail in few days, case comes up infront of judge of their choice.and the murderer is not the real one. Its surrogate. Every thing is purchasable in this society.
0 0 #Surajya One of the best initiatives of this current Government has been to launch this portal @MyGovIndia which provides a platform for the current Government to know what the citizens need. The first suggestion is that this portal, though effective has poor outreach. One of the key initiatives must be to popularize this portal. This will ensure that all voices are heard, more innovative ideas are received from citizens themselves etc.

0 0 what about the public servants who are so casual in their work? The suggestions; 1) fix a time limit and watchdog over them, if they do not complete on time, after 2 warnings, fire them & ensure they don't get any govt & private job. (Reason: attitude is that who will ask them if they don't do it). 2)The job must be PERFECT,Eg;they are just laying roads & underground drainage for the sake, but after one month pit and holes, ensure the contractor and the senior authority are punished #surajaya
0 0 Recently i visited my home down, during my discussion with friends, they said where is development happening. This is the impression local news papers are creating in the minds of people who are not connected with social media. They publish the development news in small portion in some corner of the news paper.So if media is not ready to give coverage of development news, Govt. should reserve some portion of front page for "Report card" and give updates on daily basis as an advertisement.#Suraja

If we'r talking good goverance, this is directly involvement of corruption, as highly positioned official takes 20-50 lacs for rich place transfer and employee created wealth by illegal transactions whick cause genuine people opposed to govement.

0 0 As regards to railways I put forwards my suggestions as below 1. Railway lines and areas adjacent to big stations of important stations should be protected from slum dwellers so that theft,unhygienic conditions,unsocials activities can be checked to a considerable level. Suggestion:  This can be done with the co-operation  of Local Urban bodies.Hence, a meeting of all sate Govt and railway Ministry, should be convened soon.
0 0 In the race to increase Gross Enrolment ratio, AICTE have given approval for Engineering courses without examining demand as required under AICTE act , resulting in Gross unemployment and under employment of Engineers.

Make Engineering courses modular with Diploma  exits after each year and allow  re-entry any time
0 0 #Surajya Minimum Educational Qualification (at least) should be mandatory for politicians who wants to represent their constituencies. When minimum Educational Qualification is required for the post of a MTS (Peon) then why not for politicians who controls/runs the ministry and/or legislate or participate to make country developing. Self Governance and good governance will succeed only when the educational qualification should be required for all jobs/service for public service.

0 0 #Surajya To make any service either more effective or more reachable to end people, do practice with genuine feedback from same end people without any force. I recommend feedback practice by online with reference to that service identified-or-searchable by some prefix started by their town/district/state. As well, people should be registered in national public repository like MyGov. By this, Gov. can know effictiveness of service with goods quality/employee behaviour while servicing.
0 0 Please review the PMKVY scheme and allow it to run under NCVT MES scheme were no franchising is allowed and NCVT certificates are recognized world wide.

0 0 #Surajya,For convenience of common citizen and effective public transport, there is a need for well designed Bus Stops every kilometer in cities on either side of road. These Bus stops be linked with overhead bridges for crossing of roads and construct toilets and place dustbins in near vicinity. Expenditure incurred be offset by sponsors or selling space for advertisements. This would facilitate safe crossing of roads, aid in Swatch Bharat Abhiyan,provide toilets and employment to poor.

0 0 #Surajya I remember hearing Modi ji's address in India Today programme before he had come to power. He talked about making every person realise that we are working for the country and not for ourselves so everyone will be highly motivated to work. The people in government offices are lethargic still and have a long way to go in learning proper customer response and people skills. That definitely needs to be looked at.
0 0 #Surajya Less talented candidate corrupt the practise desired by highly professionals, same way people cannot expect more from less talented people in govement positions.

Several months passed but roads were not recovered. Our college uniform used to become dirty due to dust after passing vehicle from such roads.

0 0 We hearthe news of non payment of true min wages to poor people who work as contract employees.  Currently no effective mechanism is available to ensure so .Ensuring min wages to poor people will remove poverty from them.Their children will study in good scools and get good education etc and finally their life style will change. Consider System change of direct payment of wages (from PSU's finance dept )to contract employees of PSU 's contractual works may solve the issue.GCCto be amended so.

0 0 The infrastructure we are provided with are good, but what about maintenance? Eg;When a new road is laid, after two weeks we find dust,sand & garbage consuming half the road.Even cleaning takes place, but it is done with sweepers who keep cleaning it.So when concerned about health, the quality of infrastructure,time it is not acceptable for current scenario. Therefore "WE CAN USE VEHICLES DESIGNED WITH BRUSHES THAT SWEEPS AWAY THE DUST LIKE THEY DO IN OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES"#surajaya

1 0 #SwachchhBharatAbhiyan needs real work on the ground.First pull up agencies responsible for #CleaningUp like #MunicipalCorporations in the entire country, irrespective of their autonomous nature.This is such a wonderful scheme, and we so badly need it. #Surajya #MyGov #GoodGovernanceDay
0 0 #surajya Steps to bring black money is a very good initiative but needs more push in the coming years to close out all gaps that help people/businesses to stash cash without proper reporting to necessary Govt departments. There needs to be constitutional change to make IAS & Police department independent of political influence as such independent departments will help streamline the country quickly irrespective of the Governments in rule.
2 0 For me, #Surajya means my Government available just a click or email or phone call or letter away. A single window for all, I mean, all government services--from birth certificate, to emergency police/medical/fire services, to government documentation, to licences/ approvals, to tax payments, to death certificate--essentially, anything & everything to do with the Government (local, state or central) to be routed through this one toll-free phone number, email address & postal address. Thanks.
2 0 A large amount of PM 2.5 pollution arises due to the dust that is present in the cities. Central govt. must ensure that steps are taken at the local level to increase the green cover and reduce the dust.

1 0 One of the major issues facing this country is civic amenities. Central govt. and state govts. have to empower local bodies to tackle municipal issues of garbage, and cleanliness of streets.
0 0 #surajya Swachh Bharat initiative is excellent and steps/targets should be setup for all regions like metros/sub-urbs/village etc. Without any target, no initiative will become success hence monthly/quarterly/yearly targets should be set for every nook and corner of the country which must be tracked with utmost due diligence. This will help in more Govt-people partnership and once the mindset of everyone is set for cleanliness, then people will ensure our surroundings are always clean.

1 0 It is time for another Green revolution in India. Promote Agriculture across India by the below ways: #surajya - Mandatory basic farming training as part of School/College Curriculum. - Farmers should be given Farmer's ID card based on their revenue levels which must be renewed every year without any hassles. This process must ensure Farmers with low income levels make use of this card to purchase Agri products at subsidized rates and they can travel in all public transports freely

0 0 #Surajya Had raised a request for PCC from passport office.The service for form submission was very smooth,but the tracking of the status was very slow.I got the response from the Passport office after 4 months of my form submission. The status shown via mobile tracking was very generic. It would be nice if the status update is made more precise. The withdrawal of PF amount is made very fast. I received my money in a week or two after submission of PF withdrawal form
0 0 The Internet: The programme aims to provide broadband coverage to 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats by December 2016 and mandate communication infrastructure in new buildings in urban areas.

0 0 Provide all state college & University with high speed free internet facility as nearly all students have smart phone seeking power to unleash creatively #Surajya let local industry connect with local professional school with product, problem, promotion and people as CSR activity annually.
0 0 Straightforward IAS officers like Raju Narayanaswamy (1991 - IAS - Topper - First Rank) are not been given important positions by Kerala Government (be it Congress or Left). He is a very capble officer but dumped by politicians since he exposes corruption. Hon PM Narendra Modiji should avail his services. He can be appointed as director general of Swach Bharat for the implementation of the project.  #Surajya

0 0 Decongestion of urban centres by creating regional rapid rail transit networks like the Australian Vlink system needs to be taken up with urgency. We can only control pollution by decongesting our cities.
0 0 I would like to say that there is no meaning of any policy if you have not considered the last man of the country while making it. There is a MUDRA Loan Scheme.But, i think it's only on Paper and Only on "Mann KI Baat". When u go to any Bank (SBI), they say nothing like this. When you go with nodal officer, they say there is nothing like this. Then I want to ask that then what is like this "MUDRA LOAN". How can we say that it is #Surajya
0 0 #Surajya = remembering Sri Atal Bihari Bajpaee on this day. #Surajya = digital india with internet connectivity to the most remote village of the country. #Surajya = Computer education in the government school located in the villages.#Surajya = Ban on consuming alcohol, cigat, tobacco, gutkha, use of plastic bags. #Surajya = Creating community toilets in every villages and public places, maintanance to be done by the village panchayat.#Surajya = creating awareness for 100% attendence in schools.

1 0 SMALL THOUGHTS FROM MY SMALL MIND
1 0 small thoughts from my small mind
0 0 For the first time, Indian Railway acted so fast, that to only through a Online Complain to Railway Portal. The change is visible and a welcome move. For the first time, Government employees are serious about their job. Most importantly, they came searching for me to my Berth, to tell me that any thing else they can do for me. Just unimaginable in INDIA before. Have to ACCEPT the changes.
0 0 Please let Sadharan aadmi tate major participation through gram panchayats and local bodies and let reatire persons continue to contribute their bit for good governance.
0 0 4.There should be proper centers for Swachch Bharat Mission.People can voluntarily register themselves and then they may be assigned duties to clean a particular place. 5.For Health Care,those doctors who have retired or are not practicing may be asked to come up and adopt a village where they can treat patients 6.For Hygenic drinking water people can voluntery donate their old/used water filters at proper centers set up by government which can be reprocessed and be installed in various places
1 0 #Surajya My Govt.has initiated multiple steps like Jan Dhan Yojna,Digital India and voluntarily giving up gas subsidy with easy international link as well as least importance to subjective interference in lower class jobs,only they need to make system more answerable and all steps positively and not react in anger.
0 0 My Ideas for achieving the goal of Surajya are: 1.There should be various centers across the country where people can donate old clothes and food items which should be properly distributed to the needy. 2.For education of the poor,there should be centers where people can register themselves voluntarily.They should be allocated places where they can teach. 3.Sansad adarsh Gram Yojna should be made mandatory for at least each BJP MP & proper review should be taken of their activities in village
0 0 #Surajya All bio waste is input material for generating compost. The citizens can be encouraged individually or by forming a self help group to compost the wet waste generated in house or by virtue of vegetation adjoining the premises.  The available composting techniques are low cost and easily affordable. This will result in clean and healthy environment. The cost burden for waste disposal on municipality will substantially reduce. Thank you.
0 0 resp sir ...great idea to share citizens thoughts with govt.Thank you ! 1)Maharashtra govt should also have such forum. 2)Ayurveda Medical Officers (doctors)are still facing disparity &deliberate hatred from higher officers(all MBBS) regarding payscale &status (grA)inspire of working successfully on Group A posts since last 8 years. No Ayurveda medicine at PHC level.No security for temporary MOs . Hope to get ATLEAST cognisance of letter &reply.
0 0 #Surajya PM advised devotion of 2 hours per week towards cleanliness. It had some results. The results can be more visible by focusing on exact point of devotion of 2 hours for each citizen. Each citizen is assigned the public space in front of place of stay / work to be kept clean, i.e. the rain water drain, footpath and road up to mid point adjoining to place of stay. Thank you.
0 0 Surajya means self governance.The very Idea of self governance is that its the duty as well as right of every citizen this country to govern it.In the 69th year of the Independence where are we upon it?There is still a big wedge which is increasing day by day between the rich and the poor.why aren't we able to narrow the gap,why aren't we trying to justify the vote of the poor when it has same value as a rich.Until they are brought to mainstream of society we will be never achieving the goal.
2 0 respected prime minister, please declare a national health programme which covers all citizens of India, as the wages of private health care centre are getting higher and worsen so please kindly announce a health care plan where a common man has to pay premium of less money and ensure a quality care for his/her life threatening diseases, as because without improving poors health its not easy to become a wealthy nation
0 0 Honourable Prime Minister My broadband number is 0621-2272098.for last 10 days my phone is not working.i had complaint several times but didn't get reply. You talks about digital india , is this your digital india? I feel shame that we live in such country where our elected gov. Only shows us dream.Digital india is your dream project, is this type of dream you are showing to the people of india. Thanks and regards A harassed common indian man
0 0 whatever central govt. do  to ensure good governance its worthless if its not implemented at grassroot level effectively by state govt. Here i am referring about ration card. Due to lack of effectiveness,lack of expertise lots of people who are deserve to get,not getting ration card. So its needed for centre to address this issue by directly involving with state for effective implementation of not just this issue but all other started by central govt.
