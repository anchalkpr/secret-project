1 0 LPG gas services should be available to all the citizen of India without any control over it. In the rural area, LPG may not be affordable to the people,as they are using fire wood, cow dung, which is available them at free of cost or very nominal at rural area. but, special subsidy for fuel stove should be given to such class of people, so, they can start to use LPG. further, subsidy is the main element to such poor class people, hence, it should be given quickly in bank a/c.,

After reaching I learnt that there is a VIP pass entry is also, which is hurting, my question is why it so necessary? Moreover there was a huge amount of crowd on that day that majority of visitors were not able to go inside the stadium to experience the ceremony and many of us were came from different parts of country. Can't we stop this VIP culture

0 0 In respect to education to people our MHRD department are working very sincerely, there are so many schools and development project implemented, I want to suggest that, education system should be knowledge and skill oriented, having more practical knowledge instead of only books and reading knowledge. further, control over the education for education to all and equal,any school or colleges students must have equall knowledge and calible,skills and tellant which is in private or rich school.

0 0 In respect to pollution control,in the 21st century,it is not possible to restrict the facilities of people, but, there should be proper management to control the pollution, to encourage less polluted vehicle like CNG,elctric,maximum use of solar and hydro electricity,industrial area should be about 25kms from residence area, Industrial area should consume maximum area for greenery to control the carbot from factory.drainage and waste management should be perfect to control the pollution.

If not and necessary, styles of writing be confined to fewer methods for efficient and better recognition. Transliteration keyboard can also be provided, if needed.

We should develop metro airport
0 0 I downloaded the keyboard to my android device.. the classification accuracy is decent but not impressive. I am not sure the learning model used for training the system, even with less samples I would recommend using the writing mechanics to find the geometric invariants, instead of a deep convolutional net currently state of art for MNIST dataset. I would recommend create a similar dataset for all Indian languages for testing character recognition algorithms. http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/acl/H/H94/
0 0 Sir,in view of electricity theft can we sell electricity on board cost and pass the subsidy in consumer account so that we catch up theft . After the successful implementation of jandhan yojna we have opened huge bank accounts . We can start this project from circle level.
1 0 The Tamil tool works fine except when the letters are not tilted towards the left side. Also, when tried with mouse instead of a stylus in a laptop, it fails to recognize. But I think they can be easily rectified with proper efforts. Otherwise, this is a very good initiative taken. All the best. Thanks.

0 0 Dear Modiji, I have a simple suggestion that you open various kiosks at significant locations within the city to spread awareness and apt handling of such systems so that citizens would be able to understand their compatibility with them. Such systems were implemented by M.C.G.M in Mumbai to provide city, tourist, public transport info., navigation info. to visiting tourists as well as localites. Also we can implement such systems on trial basis in Ration shops, postal services etc.

I heartly request to start the SELF HELF FORUM, if not possible to restart, please start on common forum in which any person can share their problems and issues on which they wanted to share.It will also helpful to our mission, because, the participant will write any matter in any irrelated forum, which may not respond properly, Thanks
0 0 The system can be enhanced to "read" Tamil/Hindi scripts using an in-built camera & translate it to any other language. For example, if the camera of a system (laptop/tablet/smartphone) is pointed to a tamil text, the system shall be able to read that text and translate it to desired language like Hindi. This can be achieved by image processing techniques. Such a system will be immensely useful to decipher sign-boards, announcements etc which may be written in a language not understood by user.
0 0 I was trying to use application, but accuracy seems bit less and looks like there is no correlation between words. When i write words at an angle, accuracy drops a lot, some preprocessing  could be done here. Accuracy could be improved, with large scale neural network and deeplearning. Is there a white paper for this? some suggestions could be done if it available.
0 0 This might be a little off topic but if the system is based on voice recognition then it may also help those people who face difficulty in reading or writing. Meaning that, if the user is asked a question verbally and is allowed to input answer verbally then it may benefit more in some scenarios. System can record the voice responses. Just a thought.
0 0 Hello..I like the system that you are planning to design. But since the every person has a unique style of writing comparing with some of the samples of writings might or might not get a good result sometimes. I have one suggestion here. When a user installs this app, or uses the system for the first time a test sentence which covers all the letters of Hindi or Tamil can be given to the user to type. This way, we can capture the style of writing particular letters for that particular user.
0 0 Sir,you are 100% unique, my best wishes are with you-please encourage business women immensely to make them strong enough.
0 0 As an innovation, we can surly go for this features. And later on, based on this achievement, if we can move further ahead, and design any such device, which can recognize steno writing, and converts into words (with as much accuracy as possible), than this will take a lot's of burden off from the stenographer working in courts, and will speed up the process as well ! #DeitY, #OnlineHandwritingRecognitionSystem, #TDIL, #MyGov
0 0 in put-a writing pad vith lines  should be  used,delete option is also included.hand writing itefself may be used.
0 0 Namaste,  i have an idea about transportation security, Its like same as Airport luggage checking security, Highways toll is a place where all four wheeler have to stop for toll at least 3 min.  In every toll govt can put X-ray kind of machine to search all stuff with dog squad and vehicle on auto accelerator ( for people safety by X-rays) and same toll they can check driver drunken test or related to motor  act stuff. It may help to reduce sumggle stuff.
1 0 sir you are doing great work do like this in future also...our best wishes are with you..!!! online recognition is good..sir in india you should made this in-built function in mobile phones..which not only help the peoples but also the government...the system should be  made like this which can recognised all  handwritings.

2 0 Developing Speech to Text applications will be more helpful than hand recognition as most of the smart phones are not using stylus and typing in Tamil is also a huge task as we have lots of alphabets in the qwerty keyboard. I support to have a Speech to Text Option
2 0 Alcohal tabacoo and drugs product is legal but they can hurt lot of people.
0 0 Develop apps for speech to text & text to speech in all Indian Languages. Develop software to convert speech from Major Indian language to English & Vice versa.So a person speaks in Hindi from a mobile converted to English & then person listening mobile device converts English to any Indian languages like Gujarati,Tamil,Telugu,Bengali. This should be done instantaneously & occupy less space.Immediately language barrier in our country is broken. Similarly develop apps for text conversion also.

1 0 There are huge people in India who cannot express their innovative and constructional ideas for the society because only they don't know to write English. This online handwriting system can pull those Smart people into smart India which will aid the success of Digital India and more.
0 0 it would be great to have such a software, it will be even better if it could be provided as a built in feature in most devices. Our notes would pass the language barriers and slowly we could include more languages over the time. we could sign our documents and by text to speech, accessibility for divyang people would improve. #DeitY #OnlineHandwritingRecognitionSystem #TDIL #MyGov
0 0 It is nice idea to having the hand writing recognition software placed for Hindi and Tamil... But many part of India people does not know to write.. Also this only reduced to two language only. if that is basically for form filling then it is better to have one person one identity(aadhar card). Rather put the effort in this area. We can make use aadhar numbers to fill up those forms automatically. But we need to store signature digitally to check the person consciousness. #DeitY

0 0 Sir, from last 6 months Ex Defense Officers are sitting on Dharana for 'One Rank One Pay'. Why they are not participating in gas subsidy surrender movement. They all are drawing at least Rs 25000/- per month. It is my suggession that an appeal should be made to leave claiming their Gas Subsidy by all class 'A' and class 'B' Government officers of the country in 'Man ki Baat' by none other than prime minister himself. Thanks RKU
0 0 Nice concept.As it is mentioned strokes and traces, when the input is given the particular letter has to undergo some stroke of angle which is undefined apart from x and y.In other words what I tend to say is the angle in which each and every word projected as X and Y (in English),so as for Hindi and Tamil going to be unique for each word.Those angle must be under consideration and the high level language must be compiled to low level language as the current Java program.But this level is higher

0 0 To make such system there should be boxes like grid or graph paper inside boxes for both whole name and characters. Like there are boxes for first name and last name inside these boxes there should be gird or boxes like graph paper and in each box of the grid or graph. Zoom facility for each box can be provided while writing. Like write in zoom area. Dictionary and character support should be provided to each number, alphabet, word or line for example....remaining in the image...
1 0 A language moment is required. for example prime minister of the nation giving his speech in a language which is not known by more than 5 state people. All Indians must know 3 languages, 1. concern state's language 2.Hindi 3.English( must, since universal ) At least now the govt should take necessary steps to sort out this issue. is it possible? a big hypothetical question. then only this online recognition conversion,etc.,a blender happened 50 years earlier by splitting states linguistic.
0 0 sir, i am medical officer in primary health center yes collection of data is needed at field level . you have CDAC Multilingual Computing and heritage department they were expert in that and also involve IISC for this project and also develop Machine translation software for 22 indian languages . sir you can use E-INK tablet pc which last for 15 days battery pack.and develop all 22 languages at one time . that will benifit e governance .thank you
0 0 dear sir.I don't think that it is much needed.it can bring conflict between oter laguage as you are giving prefrence to tamil better than giving prefrence to tamil you should give prefrence to hindi more as we krow hindi is compulsory in southern state but they are hardly able to speak so you should do something for that
1 0 It is a nice  Hindi and Tamil Online Handwriting Recognition System.Technologists must try to develop such system in all language so that any indian may not find problem in the use of technology in his own language.Govt should promote such attempts so that all may contribute for Make In India.Such attempts must continue.It is a good attempt to have in Hindi and Tamil.It is easily accessible and user-friendly.

1 0 Now a days Indians are connecting with each other. like helping tendency, food and so many things. But most of the people did not give importance to the Language particularly in Hindi.

0 0 Don't allow telecom operators to change the definition of Net Neutrality. Net Neutrality means access to EVERYTHING on the Internet, without discrimination. Access for everyone is a different goal — universal access. We support universal access, but it must be to the public Internet, not some private walled garden. Don't allow telcos to split the internet and become gatekeepers of what the next 1 billion Indians can access.
0 0 Reduce the fear of Income Tax Department / Police.
2 0 Give inputs for Tamil and Hindi on-line handwriting recognition system is appreciable idea, But there is drawback in it.while recognizing characters,especially in Tamil letters are not correctly translated and spelt.even in Google translation, conversion is worst.So I request Ministry of culture,to look forward in this issue take necessary steps to make necessary steps to inbuilt proper software for each language,just as NHM Tamil typing software so all people can input their view all corner.
0 0 It can be used to digitize legal system's old files. Initially it will have a two pane method to show recognized content vs actual ones. Unrecognized works and characters will be left as it is and highlighted. Plus point here will that a single document will mostly have single hand writing so correcting one letter will correct it at all places in the document. Also, this correction can be done using captchas especially on IRCTC website!! #DeitY, #OnlineHandwritingRecognitionSystem, #TDIL, #MyGov
0 0 i think.will it work...old way of blighting up have no use on ...younger generation asks for innovative ideas...so to attract them we have to use new mathods...just put a comedy jokes on language tamil so people watch it daily...have popularity spread the news.....go on giving new ideas to develop themselves..tech from beginning...put online videos to learn..just start an app..better way
0 0 uselessly trying to create what already exists there. instead, we must focus on leveraging available technology and mediums, create new platforms so that benefits may reach the greater portion of our population.
0 0 placing servers programmed in tamil and hindi only and covert and compress the into chips and then they should be placed in each and every pen so that when the pen is highlighted over a tamil text  the server immediately catches the command and displays it on the paper automatically these pens should be named as translation pens and should be sold in the market ...i hope this will work
