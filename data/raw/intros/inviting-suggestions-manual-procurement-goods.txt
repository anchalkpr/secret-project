The Manuals on Policies and Procedures for Purchase of Goods, Works and Consultancy were issued by this Department in 2006. These Manuals were prepared in conformity with the General Financial Rules, 2005 and contained broad generic Guidelines.  To suit their local/specialized needs, Ministries / Departments were to supplement these manuals by issuing Detailed Operating Instructions; Checklists and customized formats to serve as practical instructions. 
It has been now decided to revise these Manuals. It has been also decided to initiate stakeholdersâ€™ consultation on the Draft Manual. In this context it is requested to review the provisions of the Draft Manual on Policies and Procedures of Goods and send your suggestions / comments within 15 days of the issue of this O.M. i.e. latest by 30th September, 2016.
