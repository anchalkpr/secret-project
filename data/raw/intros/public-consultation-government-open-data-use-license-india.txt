Under 6th pillar of digital India Initiative, Open Government Data Platform is endeavoring share of Government data in open domain to improve openness and transparency between Government and the public, encouraging participation of the community and emphasizing data driven decision making to enable the delivery of integrated services.
Structured data available in open format and open license for public access and use, usually termed as “Open Data,” it allows citizens and businesses to find new ways to use it and to create new innovative products and services. The Open Government Data initiative started in India with the notification of the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP), on 17th March 2012 & in pursuance of the policy, the Open Government Data Platform India (data.gov.in) was launched in 2012.
Data also is one of the most valuable resources of modern governance, sharing of which enables various and non-exclusive usages for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. Associating an Open License with Open Data is necessary to ensure the legal grounding for its potential reuse and also is crucial to ensure that such data is not misused or misinterpreted (for example, by insisting on proper attribution), and that all users have the same and permanent right to use the data. For a data user wishing to use and build on top of public data, they require assurance of what they legally can and can’t do with the data both commercially and non-commercially. To promote access to publicly held information, promoting transparency and enabling wider economic and social gain, need has been felt in the Government that there must be an Open Government Data Use License.
Government Open Data Use License - India has been drafted by the Suresh Chandra (Law Secretary, Department of Legal Affairs) Committee. After several rounds of discussions and deliberations the committee has finalized the draft of the license.
