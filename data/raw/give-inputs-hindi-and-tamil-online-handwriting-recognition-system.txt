In the rural area, LPG may not be affordable to the people,as they are using fire wood, cow dung, which is available them at free of cost or very nominal at rural area. but, special subsidy for fuel stove should be given to such class of people, so, they can start to use LPG. further, subsidy is the main element to such poor class people, hence, it should be given quickly in bank a/c.,

0 0 The system can be enhanced to "read" Tamil/Hindi scripts using an in-built camera & translate it to any other language. For example, if the camera of a system (laptop/tablet/smartphone) is pointed to a tamil text, the system shall be able to read that text and translate it to desired language like Hindi. This can be achieved by image processing techniques. Such a system will be immensely useful to decipher sign-boards, announcements etc which may be written in a language not understood by user.  
0 0 I was trying to use application, but accuracy seems bit less and looks like there is no correlation between words. When i write words at an angle, accuracy drops a lot, some preprocessing  could be done here. Accuracy could be improved, with large scale neural network and deeplearning. Is there a white paper for this? some suggestions could be done if it available.  
0 0 This might be a little off topic but if the system is based on voice recognition then it may also help those people who face difficulty in reading or writing. Meaning that, if the user is asked a question verbally and is allowed to input answer verbally then it may benefit more in some scenarios. System can record the voice responses. Just a thought.

0 0 Hello..I like the system that you are planning to design. But since the every person has a unique style of writing comparing with some of the samples of writings might or might not get a good result sometimes. I have one suggestion here. When a user installs this app, or uses the system for the first time a test sentence which covers all the letters of Hindi or Tamil can be given to the user to type. This way, we can capture the style of writing particular letters for that particular user.

0 0 Don't allow telecom operators to change the definition of Net Neutrality. Net Neutrality means access to EVERYTHING on the Internet, without discrimination. Access for everyone is a different goal — universal access. We support universal access, but it must be to the public Internet, not some private walled garden. Don't allow telcos to split the internet and become gatekeepers of what the next 1 billion Indians can access.  
0 0 Reduce the fear of Income Tax Department / Police.  
2 0 Give inputs for Tamil and Hindi on-line handwriting recognition system is appreciable idea, But there is drawback in it.while recognizing characters,especially in Tamil letters are not correctly translated and spelt.even in Google translation, conversion is worst.So I request Ministry of culture,to look forward in this issue take necessary steps to make necessary steps to inbuilt proper software for each language,just as NHM Tamil typing software so all people can input their view all corner.  
0 0 It can be used to digitize legal system's old files. Initially it will have a two pane method to show recognized content vs actual ones. Unrecognized works and characters will be left as it is and highlighted. Plus point here will that a single document will mostly have single hand writing so correcting one letter will correct it at all places in the document. Also, this correction can be done using captchas especially on IRCTC website!! #DeitY, #OnlineHandwritingRecognitionSystem, #TDIL, #MyGov

0 0 uselessly trying to create what already exists there. instead, we must focus on leveraging available technology and mediums, create new platforms so that benefits may reach the greater portion of our population.  
0 0 placing servers programmed in tamil and hindi only and covert and compress the into chips and then they should be placed in each and every pen so that when the pen is highlighted over a tamil text  the server immediately catches the command and displays it on the paper automatically these pens should be named as translation pens and should be sold in the market ...i hope this will work
