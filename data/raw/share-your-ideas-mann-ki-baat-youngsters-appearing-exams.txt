26 3 Hello to My Gov.& students, First i am pointing out some weaknesses in our edu. System 1. Teachers in gov as well as Private schools & colleges are not upto the mark. 2. Bad condition of Gov.schools they needs proper supervision. 3. Why Caste system in selection for job and admission? For students 1. Set you goal(short and long term) 2. Dont think about the results think about your today's goal. 3. Use visual learning. 4. Be relax during exam. Best wishes for exam. 
5 0 "Understand the meaning" is study or learning. So don't read but study for exam. Bring down in writing in your sentence form. A well understood topic could expressed in simple wordings of yours. Now you think you are teaching someone the topic while writing down. You'll be successful. 
7 0 Dear PM ji,Naman!!!Am Sunanda Jati, Principal of a K-12 school in western Odisha. I extend my whole hearted gratitude for choosing this topic for Maan ki baat.My humble request to you please speak to the parents not to treat their children as score producing machines.Each child is having his potential and area to excel in their lives. Mere failure or success in exam doesn't determined their future prospects. If parents support is there then undoubtedly they can do wonder.They need their parents.

2 0 There are no short cuts in life. Only hard work will pay you desired dividends. Focus on your goal in life and work step by step to achieve it . One time victory is not enough to reach your goal. Honesty to yourself is a must. Competition should always be to do better than last time. When you start realising  your potential than you will start competing to yourself. Only need of the hour is to give your best shot in whatever you do. Success will be definitely yours. Be all rounder in life.

0 0 Regarding exam point of view 1. Eat fresh fruit and protien rich grains during study 2. Play Games or do external activities for 1-2 hour between study to feel free before study 3. Force talented people to come in politics. 
0 0 A student should adopt certain strategies and prepare very thoroughly (with full concentration) in the coming weeks for the Board Exams. The student should now do a review about his/her preparation till date and accordingly proceed. Furthermore, a student should prepare for the Board Exams not just to secure high marks but also to use this knowledge to further their education and to apply that knowledge in the practical life. Lastly, they should keep their cool and give their best. 
1 0 Dear PM, I am feeling glad that govt are thinking for youngsters. 1.Make ground in a school compulsory to take out hidden talent of students. Lacs of schools are still there without a small ground to play in India. 2.Have a motivational courses in schools and colleges to motivate students to join politics to have a bright future of India, thus we  have get some bright minded and talented people in politics. 3.Make a common fully verified consultancy site to get jobs vacancies for students.

0 0 Previous year mci and supreme court of India introduced neet-ug exam for admission in all medical colleges for mbbs course to favour merit. Sir you know in India private sector medical colleges are more than public sector (govt)  medical colleges.there is huge hike in tuition fee in medical colleges even in some colleges more than 20 lakes per annum so how a middle class family afford this. Those colleges whose fee is just 5 lakh increase its fee to 12 to 23 lakh in single year. This is not fair 
1 0 I dont want reservation to be ended i just want ssc to conduct exam fairly without any mismanagement... Pls sir pay heed to ssc. Coz this deprtment can truly help inun achieving ur dream of make in india .. 
2 0 Resp. Prime Minister Sir, The very concept of 'Preparing for Exam' need change to 'Preparing for Gaining Knowledge'. Present scenario is Read Guides instead of Text Books, Join Coaching Classes instead Attending Classes, Solve last 5-10 years exam papers and write answers and Score More so as to get Good Job. This scenario need to change to 'Acquire Knowledge, Understand Its Importance and Use It In Daily Life' How? By changing pattern of Exam More stress on Practicals and Real Life projects 
1 0 This cgl 16 was conducted online but unfortunately it has snatched the real transparency .the server issue is inevitable..students are crying but ssc is happy.chairman is saying student who faved server problem its their bad luck..totally reckless statement .even i am loosing 15 marks in cgl 16 tier 2 and having no prof of it. Thousands of students have worked hard now inefficient server is ruinjng ttheir dreamsdreams.pls sir pay attnetion here.conduct cgl 16 tier 2 again in a fair manner.tnku 
1 0 A very good evening sir I am an ssc cgl we all know ssc is a constitutional body and the second biggest exam conducting body after UPSC for different group B and group C posts. Bt unfortunately in todays scenario it has lost its authenticity in the eyes of students. Cheating malpractices mismanagement etc has touched the sky. And a laborious student is the real sufferer of tthis inefficiency and adding fuel to this fire ssc is paying no heed towards this. It just says everything is ok but no..

0 0 It is necessary to understand topic of subjects, instead of memorizing the topic content. In fact now all profanations courses entries are through entrance tests therefore scoring high in board exam under such a tension is no more required. Off-course we are planning to weed out "Ratta system" of British rule.It is wastage of time,money and energy to memories poems,essay or any content which does not test any skills except memory.

1 0 Respected PM of INDIA, I would like to express my suggestions on G.S.T slab on Telecom services(mainly on mobile bills). I came to know that mobile bills comes under 18% slab,if it comes under 12% slab poor and middle class people will benefited. Now a days mobile is necessary for every purpose, mainly for DIGITAL INDIA which we all are working for. If telecom services become costlier people may deviate from using digital services. They simply switch to other NON-DIGITAL processes. 
0 0 my idea is to first cancel the Quota system in job oriented exams/entrance exams etc because the youth is the building block of the nation.And due to Quota system Unreserved candidate suffers a lots of problems even after scoring good marks in exams he/she not get the job or admission just because of category.For example SSC exam,one student(general) become inspector after getting 400+ marks,SC/ST/OBC become at only 350+.So, at last its a humble request please cancel the Quota system in job exam

0 0 Sir, The engineering education system in india is totally failed because of the business interest of institute rather than providing quality of education and various flaws in engineering program. even we are going for digital india but we are still studying very old syllabus and pattern which is not accordance to current industry demand. the second reason is the we are hiring qualified faculties not passionate faculties and believe me we have great faculties in india. 
0 0 Sir, besides my earlier points requiring serious attention, A. Population explosion, B. Corruption, there are the following equally important issues: 1. Housing rules which permit 85 to 90% of plot covered area, a house/flat is more of a pigeon hole 2. Working of babus in any public utility is horrible, 3. Most of the Govt scheme allocations (funds) target particular group/classes, what about others equally deprived, 4. Slogan is creation of multistory housing, but rules are such there is no lov

0 0 Students and parents should be told that "getting high marks is good, BUT, not getting high marks is *not end of life* ". This will remove the stress out of the students and parents. Moreover, in the long run, value-education should be added which will remove the copying/cheating by students/parents.

0 0 Exams are just an analysis done by third party who calculate only marks..! A student has lot more to do for this Nation than scoring only high marks, So do well and score till you get the key of pass. Do not waste your time by reappearing. Just use the key correctly to open the door of your future and move forward..!

But as usual biggest culprit are most of the gov services, they accept only cash. In last 30 days I have visited 3-4 gov operated offices and all uses cash. 1. Pune ST stand 2. Pune RTO 3. Mumbai ST stand. These all org deals with lakhs and crores daily. Why don't they accept cc/mobile? You have to answer. 
0 0 As per my ( Saatwik Jain ) view , As per my view , Board exams should be done in the same school.....because if we are sending board inspectors to every school that what is the requirement of sending students to different schools...??

0 0 MY REQUEST TO YOU IS THAT IN MAN KI BAAT YOU WILL TELL STUDENTS GETING GOOD MARKS IS NOT GUARANTEE OF SUCCESS.IF YOU GET LESS MARKS THAN IT DOES NOT MEAN YOUR LIFE IS FINISHED.

ANOTHER A GIRL WHO WAS A TOPPER OF IIT BOMBAY UPTO 7 SEMESTERS IN B.TECH.SHE WAS HIGHEST MARKS SCORERER.BEFORE THE FINAL EXAM SHE FELT THAT WHAT IF SHE DIDNOT GET GOLD MEDAL.ON THATDAY SHE COMMITED SUICIDE 
0 0 Some major problems faced by students giving exams at various stages of life esp. those giving competitive exams like engineering, medical , other graduation entrance exams, non availability of important dates regarding exams, sample papers , proper guidance to enter various Indian Institutes at one place. Recently I came across an application on Google play store “ ALL ABOUT EXAMS”  which has very sincerely overcome the above issues and guide the students in all aspects. 
0 0 Children appearing for examination should not concentrate only on the mark scoring or percentile but they should understand that examination is nothing but a translation of their hard effort in study/learning which is to be converted into words in the answer sheets. It is none other than their confidence which will bring good marks. Keep believing in yourselves. ये लक्ष्य कठिन, पर अभेद्य नहीं। चल राह पकड़, दृढ़ कर नयन।। अनमोल बडा, तेरा विद्याधन। हे किशोर मन, उठ, कर प्रण।। 
0 0 Dear sir, the exams of many young students are around the corner. We should support the 21st century generation. No matter how well their grades are in the board exams, their future cannot be decided by these exams!  Edison once quoted" A single sheet of paper cannot decide my future". The greatest minds on this globe were never good at grades. 
1 0 Dear Sir, humble request behalf of all real Indian talents that please cancel reservation in education. Every student study from same books, same teacher teaches him and all of them solves same exam paper then why system should makes difference of category and cast for future admission. •When all students are studying at same level it means opportunity has given to everybody then admission for future education should be given on merit basis. •Even financial background of open or general catego

0 0 SIR I AM A STUDENT PREPARING FOR NEET MEDICAL ENTRANCE EXAM 2017. NOTIFICATION FOR  NEET HAS NOT BEEN COME OUT TILL DATE. BUT, IT IS KNOWN FROM NEWSPAPER THAT ONLY 3 CHANCES WILL BE ALLOWED FOR APPEARING THE EXAM. I AM COMING FROM A BACKWARD PLACE IN KERALA AND I HUMBLY REQUEST THAT THIS CHANGE MAY BE EFFECTED IN NEXT YEAR ONWARDS OTHERWISE THE UNEXPECTED DECISION WILL AFFECT THE CHANCE OF POOR STUDENTS STUDYING FOR THE NEET EXAM FOR THE LAST YEARS. 
1 0 sir, students are mostly wasting their time in writing unnecessary assignments and its time to change the education practices. Young students are carrying burdens in the form of bags and their creative levels are suppressed and they are taught to give more importance to ranks and grades than the actual knowledge. It's better to bring students under one roof which enhances their creativity. In Andhra Pradesh there are factories which are brain washing students to concentrate only on ranks. 
0 0 Passionate teachers can serve the nation & produce lot of talent for the country. All factors patents , teachers, students all played very important role to clear the exam in my opinion hence if hardwork & passion is there than definitely we all get the success. 
0 0 Whole year students work Hard near about 15 Hrs/ Day (08 Hrs. in school,04 Hrs in tuition classes,03 Hrs at home)Parents should behave friendly with their children during exam time. Help in studies like at study time make a tea & coffee for our children. Don't give extra burden of result (Percentage). Bye a small-small gift like chocolate, sweets etc. for your children give . Do not discussed at home on percentage or admission for higher study. Maintain a positive atmosphere of home. 
0 0 For exams, students should understand that exam is similar to a performance art, like you act or sing or dance on stage or draw a stroke of ink on canvas i.e. once done, you can hardly revert and you would make yourself miserable to make it up. What professional artists in performance art do is that they practise the same thing for thousand times before they appear in front of the audience. To do good in exam, students need to do the same. All the best to all who will appear in exams this year. 
0 0 Sir, I would like to suggest that in our schools Yoga and Vaidik education like Vaidik Math and Physics must be taught to give our kids the same education which was in practice before Britishers spoiled our education system. Thank you.

0 0 Sir Its very unfortunate that the intelligence in my country is judged by the numbers/grades on a piece of paper.Let higher secondary education be compulsory for all citizens.There should be no fails.Students below the percentile of average should be given option of skill development programme at tender age of 14-16 yrs partially sponsored by the Government.Every citizen has a birth right to contribute towards nation's development."Har haath ek kaam"Jai Hind #PMonRadio,#AIR,#MannKiBaat,#MyGov

1 0 ‘Mann Ki Baat’ for students Since, this is Exam time means a very crucial phase of a student's life as the result will determine the destiny and future path of his life. But, the most important thing which matters is that "Hard Work always pays." & Education doesn't merely implies marks or grades. True Education is something which stays with us always and need not be revised again & again. The Knowledge & the Values we imbibe in ourselves make us educated. So, work hard & value time. 
0 0 Students work very hard round the year and lose their confidence at such a crucial time.All you need to do is just believe that you are best and you will crack it whether it is JEE or boards, you have done enough preparations needed to do so..!Start solving as many practice papers you can with setting alarm clock at the same hours of the day as of your final examinations.To concentrate and increase brains`efficiency by having 6hr sleep, meditating, following time table,listen white noise,relax

0 0 Reservation according to cast is politically  motivated  hurting a lot of students . General category students scoring 80%-90%  don't get admission in any good institutes while reservation category scoring 30-40% get through top universities . we request a fair chance for all with subsidies for bright students from economically weaker section 
0 0 Sir, heartening to see Dubai's tallest tower with tricolor decoration by digital beaming on the eve of republic day. Let us do that in India in all the tallest tower or building of each city during ind day/rep day. All industrial high rise chimneys can be put to use.  Central IT ministry should find means to encourage and implement. The spirit will enlighten the inner feelings of fellow citizens like never before. 
1 0 In my view students going to face board exams should not take load of study they should set their goals and accordingly study their storng zone and weak zones and revision is must .Do not take lot of tension study with enjoyment and do little meditation and feel from inside that i want to acheive this not for my parents but for myself do or die is old fashion do it before you die is new one.All the students hope you all do well 
0 0 Sir many of youngsters are studying day and night to do better in the exams. Though all will not get 99%. The problem with many a students is their career. Surely each one has exceptional quality where they can do better. With many a students problem lies in proper counselling in this period. You will do a historical decision,should you announce formation of counselling camps headed by well known experts particularly in small towns and rural areas headed by district or state level officials 
0 0 Teaching Profession ha sbecome the Last Option of Youth now.Government must see that Capable Youth take up Teaching profession at all levels more particularly at Elementary and High School Level Education. 
0 0 practice yogic breathing to concentrate and relax. Avoid outside play during exam days to avoid finger injury and immobility  . Take help of internet for fundamental clarification in the absence of immediate counselling. Do not leave any topic untouched. Selective reading make students jittery and low in confidence . Lastly take blessing of parents before exam.

0 0 CPGRAMS, the grievances redressal forum is not sensitive to the grievances fed into the portal. The officials pass on the buck and there is no accountability. And as such the mechanisim is not people friendly and is not sensitve to the genuine peoples problems made as such by the insensitive  and irresponsible officials who should be made personally accountable and time frame  for redressal of grievances should be  strictly adhered to. 
0 0 Use maximum time to preperations for their exams with social works.they should organise a group including educationally backward students and join their hands to uplift all.priovide little time to such students.while someone shares the subjects it will helps both to remember it forever.its much better then byheart learning.study with criticism.scoring is not important try best to built intellectuals n society.Be bold always.

0 0 Students who are of same calibre do not stand at the same level. It is observed that Students from autonomous or private colleges secure more marks than others. This results in unjust for the students at platforms like SSB selection for army etc, where basic criteria of selection are graduation Percentage.

Information Technology, Economics, Environmental science, Religious Studies, Art and Culture could be few to suggest. It shall relieve the students from the stress of studying the subject of not their choice at the same time there would be depth in studies. Further, Country needs world class universities to tap its human capital.Civility and studies of religion should also form part of syllabus.

0 0 Recently a TV channel conducted a programme and asked youth why we are celebrating Republic day. Out of hundred only 2 given correct answer. I feel it is due to present education system which is concerned about the core subjects. It is required to insist on the Institutions to have at least one period a week to have General knowledge. This is leading to public not having respect to the system or Constitution. Immediate steps shall be taken to educate youth for taking system in curriculum.

0 0 you must suggest students that they should not use facebook instagram twitter and other social networking sites during exam time as they distract the focus of students. one may discard this but this is true. 
1 0 An issue that seriously needs to be addressed is the  importance we give to scores. Education does not begin or end with scores and we need to keep reiterating this. I am a working professional who appeared for CAT this year and scored 95 percentile.I got no IIM calls as they dont consider anything less than 99 and its educating students for management positions but because of this a student aims for top score to get into these colleges instead of actually getting a job and relevant experience

Many of the private schools just keeping study limited to mind scores of exam only. I am in view that to study must be affordable to all even in private schools also. Limited or cap must be fix to private schools fees to help parents / students to get affordable and valuable education for batter life.

Even sir i observed that till 12th standard lots of student doesn't know about the sports stadiums in their respective Tehsil or Districts.

They shouldnt eat anything that may increase the risk of an upset tummy.... and never skip a meal... as skipping meals would only cause severe stomach ulcers.

In 8th NCERT covered the syllabus of How do we do transaction at bank via cheque etc. Bt I'm100% sure no single school teach this thing practically so govt shld tke steps in real manner nt in dcmnts only

0 0 Dear Modiji, Since this is an open forum for students, i feel, first and foremost, they need to be relaxed and feel good about themselves when they go to write their exams!!! If one isnt relaxed or is not comfortable with themselves, how can they give their best, especially during times like exams??? Students ,for a right frame of mind, need to unwind regularly, talk to their parents and close relatives other than just their friends who themselves are appearing for exams.They must have faith! 
0 0 Dear Shri Modi Ji, Exams are just a part of the student's academic career which will not decide the success or failure of a person's life. Students should study to acquire knowledge and not for the sake of passing exams. It is also important to study for their sake and not to compete with their friends or negibours. Learning should be a joyous venture and not a sickening process. My best wishes to all the students.

I'm Preeti Singh from Lucknow and pursuing B.tech from SRMCEM and till now my parents have paid 5-6 lacs and above, and we belong to middle class family, so there should be some scheme which offer girls to get higher education at low money.

0 0 Dear Sir, my another point which is not related to exam, is for economic equality given by Indian constitution, that why Govt. is not looking for Income tax return filed by Private doctors and Advocates practicing in different courts in whole country, who (both Advocates & Pvt. Doctors) are charging huge fees from their clients or patients, but not issuing any proper recipts and only few of them are filing ITR & only for 20-30% of their actual income. But we R paying IT on salary& pension both. 
0 0 sir i just want to tell you that please do something for education system,1-please close the Hindi medium school,do provide education in only one language English,not both bcoz its confusing to all ,first we done study in Hindi medium school after that for competition we should have to knowledge about English,bcoz of that many students not succeed in exams & interview.please convert all (primary & G.I.C.) Hindi medium school in English only,now a days everyone wants English speaking employee 
0 0 Dear students, Plz be away from mobile and other sites like games,computer games, facebook, what's app at least for 2-3 months before exam and normally also u should give more than half an hour on such sites on mobile or PC. Instead of this u go to open ground and give one hour over there, which will help you to maintain ur health and feel fresh for furthur study. Also do YOGA/meditation everyday to increase your concentration in studies. MY SUGGESTION IS THAT-DO NOT DO ANYTHING IN EXCESS. 
0 0 only imp. that i want to said that the children must study in morning from 4am to 7am which is most energyable time to study. for concentration in our study to meditation. show that ur mind is free from other thin and do study. peace fully and before exam only revise the matter not learn and before 1 hour of exam. just keep ur mind silent. and does not  talk to anyone. best of luck to children.. 
0 0 children are good at academics at present provided they avoid social network sites.. as on an average they loose 3 hours a day only in this unproductive networks. It is bad part of the generation.they have to avoid this till the exams are completed & the power supply authority at each state cut off power supply for atleast 90 minutes per day it is bad for the studens.I hope this should be taken care by respective one now.with best wishes for all students. 
0 0 Like IIT  the educational videos are available please give orders to record the school lectures of good educational institutions like kendriya vidyalaya, DPS ,donbosco etc to upload their lectures sothat easily every where one can get this knowledge. As technology has increased so please use the technology to crash the exam. 
0 0 1.Donot mugup any subject try to understand the subject. After reading ask your self what you have understood read a paragraph close the book and try to think and repeat it by closing the book. Book reading will make you understand 30% but watching an educational videos on the same subject matter will increase the efficiency fasten the understanding. For example if ur reading history book regarding tipusultan or British Empire just watch a educational videos in you tube/any site will grasp 
0 0 i would say rather then focusing anything else please focus on population . the law should be imply in India that you cant have more then 2 children like it was in china few years back Chinese govt allowed only one child at home so then they took care of population still they are no 1 in terms of population . i believe by this we can work and focus remaining people and make them educated or literate and also provided good education. education is biggest challenge and Indian peeps learn frm japan

0 0 Sir, One nation one education policy must be implemented like GST one nation one tax, this will not only enhance better education and will also unite us as one country. As children are messengers of tomorrow & carry all thoughts & teachings of yesterday to shape up their present & hence make their believe & thoughts. If we incorporate right teachings at primary & secondary level into minds of children about their leaders & country in early stages of life that ideas & believes remain till end.

2 0 Hello Sir, I think, to make our education system better, we must introduce 'One Nation, One Education' policy in India. We can start it by having a central authority in India, a platform where diff. state boards can share information and which could make sure that every student of India is being delivered the 'SAME and STANDARD' education in every part of our nation. We should make sure that our talent remain in our nation to contribute in our progress. To know more, open the PDF....... 
0 0 Education- -children must realise their passion and persue it, its extremely wrong with today's parenting that they impose their aspirations for difficult exams, doctory and engineering, irrespective of children's potential in some particular field. -schools must teach something for children's spiritual awakening. -India must have equal oppurtunities for sportsmen, artists and all. 
0 0 Dear Students !!! Before going to the Examination, you have already put your best effort to cover the syllabus. The Questions are already fixed, sealed and ready for distribution. Thus, your preparation as well as the questions both are fixed. So you must feel positive with sufficient confidence while sitting in the Exam Hall. Your positive attitude will surely make you steady as well as confident while writing Exam Paper. Your will power to do the best will bring you success. ALL THE BEST !!! 
0 0 Hello sir, Well i think our Board of Education should put more focus on practical work in school and colleges rather than theory, passing marks should determine by one knowledge about the practical things because that is what matters. Theory Knowledge is valid upto a few days or months, but once you do it in reality, reality of real education reveals. #PMonRadio #Air #MannKiBaat #MyGov 
0 0 Honourable PM, Digital India is on its way,but IT Engineers hav to migrate all over country to get jobs.

Pls implement it. 
0 0 I think OC(open category) students are being effected badly in various competitive exams due to following 5 reasons.. 1.Age criteria 2.Fees structure 3.Language problem 4.Reservations 5.Scams in exams : my experience: I am born in a poor vysya (open caste) farmer family.. Studied at govt. school in Telugu medium (Andhra Pradesh) from childhood in a small village (rural area). I am badly effected in various competitive exams due to above reasons. Hon'ble Modi Sir ,please save us. 
0 0 Dear Modiji, When you encourage students to bravely appear for exams. Then tell them to study for knowledge and not marks. Its the knowledge that will take the individual and country ahead and not marks. Ask them not to cheat in exam. Tell them to write whatever they know instead of copying from their friends or classmates. If stundents want to help in fighting corruption then they should themselves avoid corrupt practices.

0 0 Respected, i just want to suggest u that make control on Fee structure of Competitive Exam because all open category students are not belongs to rich or middle class family That's why they unable to pay Bank exams conducted through IBPS because there is too much difference between fee structure for other community students & open category students. as like for minority fee is 100Rs & for open category it was 600 or 700Rs So,it is not affordable to all. Requested to you to reduce fee. 
0 0 Sir very recently we celebrated our Republic day. This time during our Republic Day celebration at Kalpna Foundation, an organisation founded by me to educate poor children organised preamble reading program at our teaching venue in Durgakund. We find preamble on the very first page of NCERT books but students are of the habit of reading everything except the preamble. It's impoatant for all of us to know our constitution because it reminds us that along with rights we have responsibilities too 
0 0 Hon'ble PM, I would suggest that there should be an increase in number of centres for exams like NDA Exam, CDSE, etc. where only capital cities are chosen as centres. Myself being a student from a small city, can understand the pain that village students have to suffer, when they attend such exams. Pain of travelling, waking all night, locating centres, etc. I would suggest that main cities be set as centres, e.g. in Maharashtra, we can have Pune, Aurangabad, Nanded, etc. as centres. #mannkibaat 
0 0 "The sizes and shapes of REFILLs of BALL POINT PENs vary from pen to pen; Company to Company. As a result, when students visit shops to buy a new REFILL, the students find difficulty to get a matching one. The shop might have many varieties of REFILLs, but, sometimes none of those are matching with the students' PEN. The students may have many such PENs without proper availability of matching REFILL. This will lead to wastage of money and material. This problem is also causing displeasure." 
0 0 Respected sir,, My Suggestions are like this 1. First to change the learning method from school level,, so there the Teacher should be committed to deliver his knowledge with high level of interest and energy,, it will leads to built sincerity in youngsters brain.. 2. The students parents help to students in completion of specific portion of lessons in each subject in a friendly environment 3. Every student should feel free before exams and during examinations,, teaches has to motivate them. 
0 0 Respected Sir In each of my student's batch the final sentence I give them is "If u have studied no need 2 panic & if u haven't no use 2 panic" Through this forum Request Parents Not 2 compare Children Each child Is Unique Let It remain unique Need of hour is to make them follow rules by our example Give them faith, self-respect, understand them & their problems. They will Never let us down. This is my way of bringing them 2 normal & socialize them Let's Join Hands to Secure Our Future AMEN

0 0 Greetings from my side sir. Sir, there is no loan scheme available for the students who wish to gap a year for preparation of medical/engineering entrance examination to get coaching in any coaching institute. As the coaching they provide is not a course. And the fees of such coaching institute is too high for a lower middle class man to pay. Please do something in this regard. 
0 0 Respected Sir, Promote for Ph.D. to our engineers. A faculty could not get benefit of it directly. We say, a Teacher is a key person in education, but teacher is not getting respected in Engineering Education in terms of seniority, salary, as per experience.

0 0 Respected Sir, many issues regarding out Indian Education. I will talk about Engineering Education. 1.Schooling to Engineering Education (Diploma,UG,PG & Ph.D.) should be in a flow. We see that 11th-12th std. & Diploma are difficult than B.E./B.Tech. & M.Tech/M.E. is easier than B.E./B.Tech.2.Industrial Experience of a faculty should be counted in terms of salary, as many universities are not counting industrial experience in teaching.3.Outcome based education is good but not 100% for India. 
0 0 Please remove caste based reservation on marks from competitve exams. In IITJEE, ST and SC's need only 45-55/360 and general needs above 105 marks. If you want to help them then give free education and facilities. But why these inequality regarding marks is there. 
0 0 The most important thing to practice before any exam is a peace and calm . What troubles and spoils exams is the pressure and fear , not the exam itself. A student can answer the same questions in a relaxed environment but when he is expected to perform under restrictions of time and stress of competition , mind finds it hard to focus and nervousness results in poor performance A balance between study and games will result in greater confidence and improve performance

0 0 In Indian philosophy every sanskar is defines to achieve some change, Education or Shiksha is also a SANSKAR and meant for changes.

It’s the Health, happiness, self-acceptance etc. are also consider as important ingredient for an educated person.

0 0 Sir There is a problem with our education system. Most of our study is based on craming our books and then reproducing it in our exams rather than understanding. We need our studies to be more vocational. They need to be more application based. We need them to boost our talents and interests right from the starting. It is difficult to have entire course changed but I think we can start by having one period every day for every class in which we can learn how to boost our talents and interest.

1 0 Sir,The existing exam oriented learning system in schools should replace with a system to evaluate/identify  the interest/potential/skills of a stud't from lower classes.Interactive sections with stud'ts/teachers/parents will help to get an outcome.The stud'ts can be routed/guided according to their performance basis,from H.S classes onwards.Average/LD students should give options to select subjects for the final exams,ac'dg to their talent.Aim the overall develop't of stud'ts with diff IQ/EQ.

0 0 All Private Schools must be brought under Right to Information Act.

1 0 Sir, it is common to see students having to apply for re-evaluation in the CBSE board exams,and most of the times their requests are also genuine. So don't you think at some point it could be the fault of the examiner as well. Some examiners only give the average marks, that too BLINDLY. We as students are quite confident on ourselves and we know how much we can score in these examinations. Therefore I request you as a STUDENT myself to please reinitiate the re-evaluation scheme in CBSE.

0 0 One of the reason for tax evasion is people not asking for receipts/bill for their purchase in stores/shops and which opens window for shopowners to evade tax.

0 0 Respected Narendra Modi ji, In my view our education system should stress on overall development of the child. In the sense, our educations should make our students Physically ( through Yoga), Intellectually ( through Studies ), Morally and spiritually strong through education. Intellectually one can gain knowledge through various information sources but what I feel more important in the present scenario is moral and spiritual education which changes the mindset of the students. 
0 0 Dear PM Modi Ji, Namaste, Please emphasize students -To be a part of our nation's Growth story in the years to come. -Please ask them to be positive towards nation ( not to listen to " kuch bhi chalta he " attitide) -Please  lay foundation  in their mind to inculcate  " India first, India our nation " thinking and Constitution is the ultimate guideline. -Please request students to be innovative  and achieve something for Country's Growth.

Education will give u the knowledge of books where one must be prepare to face the life exam .Marks & grades cannot be judge any student caliber.

0 0 For Students, 1. As the examination date is near the students should refrain themselves from studying new topics. They should rather 'Revise by practicing extensively'(ROPE) what they have studied. 2. Practice Past year Ques Papers. For teachers, They should avoid making statements which can loose the moral of students. For Parents, They should tell the importance of education without stressing what could happen if they fail. The psychology should be to be optimistic yet conveying message.

A little anxiousness is indeed common for every student having his boards for the first time but with patience hard work and concentration the goal becomes much easy to achieve. Keeping these things in mind i wrote my exams and i scored a 10CGPA. Another important thing is to keep ourselves away from negative people and thoughts and even if the marks are not good one should not lose hope

I was of course very happy go lucky through the year and would cram last minute for the exams.

It always worked, I would get just the right questions :)  However, it is important to study throughout the year and also pray to God for guidance.

0 0 Dear PMji: As you know, an English proverb says"Justice to be done and it should be seen to be done"  Similarly, the govt. is doing lot of developmental works in India since assuming office. Most of the medias don't these for their own reasons.   There should be a TV [from party] to showcase the developments being done and people should really see those! Doordarshan is not sufficient.  Our own TV called Kamal[Hindi]Lotus[Eng] Thamarai [Tamil] should do this to highlight achievements! Namaskar! 
0 0 Sir, I live in New Zealand but my heart is always work for India 24 hrs. Every year I see many students commit suicide after exam or after the results.

If it will be from you then it's impact will be more and atleast some of the young lives we can save. As exams are always stressful in India but when I came here children enjoy schools more than holidays.

0 0 There are three main ways to face any examinations: Prepare prayerfully, Proceed positively, Pursue persistently. I took CBSE 10th & 12th finals in 2014 & 2016 respectively. Neither was it extremely challenging nor was it extremely easy for me to earn CGPA 10 & then 96.8%. Avoid memorizing without understanding the content. Understanding what you learn aids better recollection. Ask for help at the earliest. Eat & sleep well; health is wealth, especially during exam time. You can do it!

Our system gives little window to practical and even practicals are to be memorized the way they are written there is no room for inovation. Students should see implementation of concepts on platforms like youtube to supplement their preparation. CTET's result is worrying, it shows the burden on students and why Tution system is increasing

Today fees for Toddlers are higher than MBA /Diploma fees .

0 0 Sir,  I think we should teach in our schools about how great our philosophy was than the western philosophy. How everything we achieved earlier in civilization, about which people are still researching. I really think our syllabus has to be redrawn. Since childhood a child should know about greatness of civilization he/she is a part of. Secondly i think knowledge is best learned in the language of his/her mother tongue. I request you to apply this at all stages of education both school & college

0 0 For Class XII English, I would like  to advice the students to prepare the  very long composition questions of the writing section by going through The Hindu- Open Page, and Essays from CSR and for value based answers they may read the editorial of CSR. Every student taking the board exam must go through the text books chapters at least 7 times with understanding as it is psychologically believed that to remember words for longer time let that pass before your eyes at least for 7 times.

0 0 Respected sir, Firstly I would like to thank you for the great step like demonetisation. I am a teacher appointed under sarva shiksha abhiyan. I m thankful to SSA for reviving education system through fee less education, mid day meal and other grants. I work at my level best to educate my students. But a teacher's effort is disturbed when he does not get salary for 7 months. My state is Manipur. SSA teachers r even looked down by other staff of the same department. Plz do the needful 
0 0 Hello sir, please reply my message 
2 0 Dear Prime Minister, As a student in the past & parent now, I gist below few critical points with my exeprience reqd just BEFORE examinations: AA) FOR PARENTS: 1. Never COMPARE your children progress in studies for the examination with other children's progress/method. 2. Never force children to score 100% in every subject & get First Class always. 3. Every student has his own talent. BB) FOR STUDENTS: 1. Give your best to your ability. 2. Keep cool, clam & steady 3. Don't panic. 
0 0 Must Read those appearing for any exams: One more thing wants to add that is Emotional Intelligence. One of the most important parameters for all the students. Control their emotions through intelligence like Nervousness during exam hours, anxiety before the exam and more... Please talk to your Parents/Teachers about this. They may guide you in a better way. Regards, 
0 0 Hello Sir, I would like you to discuss the problems aspirants are facing now a days. Name an exam which is fairly conducted from JEE,PMT exams, SSC exams and many more. We have seen similar issues with CAT exams this year. Associations like SSC have made mockery of job exams.True aspirants are unemployed because merit of exams like SSC-CGL is touching the sky. I would like to know sir what steps are being taken to protect the interest of young, frustrated,unemployed and hardworking aspirants.

0 0 society and family should not put more stress on student expecting more than what they deliver. School/ college should live in realities of competitive world where performance of students are much below what they get in School. school education should make more practical orientation where they learn how to earn and live dignified life in future.

1 0 If we have a universal basic income for all, the value of currency will get offset by that much amount. It's all demand and supply game which determines the value of currency and even exchange rates. Schemes like MNREGA provide for security to citizens. Humans must move to high value work. Automation machines are also made by companies which in turn are run by high paid humans. 
0 0 Respected Sir, the students should have holistic approach while preparing for examinations. 
0 0 Sir I suggest an online examination system for goverment school children. Schools have to be equipped with WiFi and TABs. Student can download a question paper from central server into his TAB for a scheduled examination with MCQs. Examinations may be three types. Class subjects, Psychology and IQ. Student can be assessed over a period. Even Teacher's and School performance can also be assessed. District Education Officer can be given the admin role to prepare the question papers. 
0 0 I believe for getting admission into IITs/NITs coaching doesn't play the crucial role. It is not difficult for those, who really score outstanding in school exams. Knowledge is more important than anything. Guidance is required to prepared for IITs & NITs. Govt has started a forum with the help of IITs to help & support those students. Regards, Som Shekhar 
1 0 Aadarniya Pradhan Mantriji, I am a special educator and teacher and writing to you for the second time.Sir,it gives me great enthusiasm to know your involvement in the future of our children.I suggest the following for our students taking exams. Firstly - Believe in yourself.You need not score the best of marks to achieve in life. Secondly - Don't think of getting into only blue collared jobs after college.Join our armed forces or Govt jobs where there are too many vacancies to make a change. 
0 0 Sir, We are faced with a problem about encroachments on the common land of our coop society which though very simple, is not getting solved. We have wasted nearly 20 years with civil adm and 15 years with courts. If I am permitted, I will send it in letter form. 
0 0 Respected Prime Minister Today every student dream of getting into IIT'S and NIT'S. But it is really very difficult to get into these institutions without Coaching classes. This is not possible for every Indian student as they can't afford these classes. In fact according to my opinion the board marks must play some significant role for admission in this institutes as at least a poor student id capable of giving his best in boards.

0 0 Hey there.... Subjective exams have become so outdated nowadays because of their lack of actual intelligence-measuring capacity. Rather than measuring intelligence, it measures one's ability to mug-up the book and write the answers. Objective exams, on the other hand, measures the intelligence and the hard work done by him/her. You may argue that the student who may not have prepared may get lucky with the options. But the probability is very very less. #PMonRadio #AIR #MannKiBaat #MyGov

0 0 1.Exams at early stages like Nursery, KG should be given less importance and more emphasis must be placed on inculcating the right moral values like cleanliness, punctuality, discipline, honesty and inculcating a sense of belongingness for the country. 2.Special sessions should be organised for introducing kids to the freedom fighters and drawing inspiration from the life of great men like Swami Vivekanand, Rabindranath Tagore, to name a few. 3.Innovation should be encouraged. 
0 0 cont'd, Sir kindly look into this matter, one suggestion is ,make some arrangements to monitor MBBS doctors preparing for PG entrance, console those who not get selected for the seats,by opening enough chances to work them for the people of the nation ,so that skilled human resource in one of  essential services will not get spoiled..like opening special recruitment office of that kind ,with efficient HR managers and social workers .looking forward as I myself one MBBS graduate in such situation 
0 0 Honorable PM Narendra Modi, As we are witnessing heavy snowfall in J&K and near LOC area, we are facing challenges and life risks for our soldiers protecting our borders. In recent times, many soldiers KIA due to avalanches. So, I would like to suggest that these soldiers must be provided by GPS unit for each individual specially one who are in Avalanche-prone areas, so that timely rescue is possible. 
0 0 Instead of visiting foreign countries if you have visited the small towns of India and seen the problems faced by students,teachers,schools and common man and tried to instruct the authorities to improve it then it would have been more fruitful.Our children are still appearing for the exam with a fear in their mind to pass in the exam and not to excel in life. 
0 0 Modiji we are talking about big promises.But do you think are we making our roots strong .No all the political parties keep on blaming each other just to prove that they are superior than others.But these parties are fighting for themselves and not for the people for whom they are got elected.You also try to prove that Kejriwal or Rahul Gandhi is like this or that but now you are elected the head of this nation by people then why do you represent any political party and why not INDIA only 
0 0 1] The exam preparation is not only for 3 Hours of final exam.Read and forget type preparation.Please remember you are preparing for your life. 2] Short cut in preparation / keeping some optional is not right way. 3] Use Text book for syllabus and not guides just questions and answers. If you know/understand the subject No question remains question for you. 4] The exam system is foolish in nature for judging entire year in just few hours. Marks foes not matter , problem solving in real life

0 0 My daughter is class 1 studying in one of the best schools in the city..She appeared for an exam conducted by some external body in the school.But I was shocked to hear from her that the teachers(belonged to school itself) who was invigilating the class during the exam told many answers to the children.My daughter told me that our teachers made us CHEAT in the exam.Shocking! A 6 year old child is learning this from school.and the senior teachers refused to accept that this has happened

0 0 Being Tension free while going for exams is very important. Four hours before start of the exam no studying the answers. Being tensed, you will forget to recall the answer and can get panicky. In these four hours, closing your eyes, quickly go through images of pages you have studied, recall where you have scored good marks for which answer, one sentence answers etc. But in no way try to recall full big answers. Parents should not set expectations while child going for exams. 
0 0 Being a teacher for the past 30 years, I would like to share my ideas on the study environment at home or hostels.Just I request the parents/in-charges to introspect are they giving a calm, peaceful study environment to their wards? Observe ,the children maintain dignity themselves at Our temples,mosques, churches and other holy places because the environment influences and control their minds.In a same way, their study room or place also should be maintained and self motivated.

0 0 I think Primeminister should ask students to prepare for exams with confidence and dont run behind marks. Today Youngsters run behind marks and loose all the energy and motivation in race. Instead they should focus on innovation and learning #LearnAndInnovate. Parents force their child to get good marks by mugging up. Instead they should force their child to use book knowledge and try something new. Such child focussed on Innovation will be more successfully even with low marks.

Please sir Remove these Lords for History.

0 0 Every student and parent must think about exam as a test to the knowledge on a subject matter a kid posses rather than comparing themselves with other students , based on these result students and parents must have a healthier discussions on the interest and future of students. because of the stress on scoring higher marks we most often produce more machines with mechanical behaviors than Dr.Abdulkalam, Aryabhatta who were free mind thinkers with eagerness of knowledge not forced upon knowledge.

0 0 Sir, private tutions have become unavoidable for HSSCE. Even teachers advise students to join tuitions. But even after attending HSSCE lectures in addition to private tutions, students do not get enough time to study on their own and in the tests that are conducted their performance becomes very bad so that they become very unsure and insecure for the  final exams. 
0 0 I was a student in St. Joseph's High School Thalassery and later I worked as a teacher in Maharashtra Udaygiri College Udgir. Both these institutions produced good results in exams. The secret is they made students write exams every month and half a dozen times just before the final exams. You have to practice writing skills because exams are based on them. Instead of saying walking is good for health say there are only two good doctors in the world - your right leg and your left leg. 
0 0 Respected PM Narendra Modi Sir, The admission process in medical colleges is faulty if entrance is on national level which consists of same paper on same date&time so why there is regional division of states In Maharashtra Rest of Maharashtra region which have more colleges students from that region secure more seats in less marks and students from other region that is Vidarbha&Marathwada secure less seats even having higher marks so please remove region quota #PMonRadio #AIR #MannKiBaat #MyGov

0 0 Dear Prime Minister Ji I am Jayapal from Dharmapuri in Tamilnadu.  In my opinion conduct of examinations are required for a student to get graduated.  However it has become a nightmare for most of the students and those appearing for the competitive examinations because the examination results determine their future. Therefore a craft class is needed from the primary school level for the purpose of identifying the real talent a student is having.  He should be groomed in that particular skill. 
0 0 sir myself Damodar sahoo from odisha,My opinion upon the exam preparation is,student should know their syllabus before the start of preparation,they need to have the particular talent for the exam,if they don't have it,then perpare for it before to prepare for the exam.after being prepare for the exam thoroughly.they need to, before sometime of the exam,revise all what they have learn don't try to study early before the exam only revise what u have learn.........thats the key to be successfull.

Refer notes & textbook and take time to write long answers to score 100% instead trying to beat the clock. Write well during preparation.

0 0 Respected Prime Minister. Board examinations are fast approaching and children are under tremendous tension. Is it not because of weightage given to certain courses especially science courses. The child who studies Arts or Commerce is less tensed. Therefore I suggest that in the school level itself children should be taught about various avenues with respect to each course of study. And parents too to be given knowledge about each course.This reduces parents worry & make children tension free.

We studied, but we are still jobless. We can't move to private sectors because they are just ready to make harassment of us(By low salary/work overload). Please provide us lots of opportunity in govt sector. We are ready to fight competition.

That is wrong. I am the citizen of India, I must be free to apply to any state's vacancy. You should do something for it. As all students can understand english language. A state should not divide on the basis of language.

0 0 Honorable PM, My suggestions are Make all studies application-based and based on creative and logical ability. Allow children to specialize in a subject from the fifth grade itself. Give a variety of options that can be studied, and not only Science, Commerce or Humanities. Make education compulsory till the age of 17. Place more emphasis on entrepreneurial and innovative abilities. Make special provisions for children who are differently abled.

0 0 *   Stop tuition system and increase the teachers salary.  Because of the tuition system 80% of teachers don't teach in school.  Students get hard time from teacher when students don't go tuition. *   Take the test of teacher every year - Teachers must have to give exam of the area what they going to teach.  If teacher fail the exam then they can not teach that level. 
0 0 it should be make sure that all the people working in private sector and in contactor labour must be paid D C rate or govt rate of there salary it should be stickly implemated 
0 0 *Change system-A. In our county, when student get less in one subject they can get ATKT and allow to go next level.  By giving them ATKT student never improve that area and students stay weak for the lifetime.B if students are not good in 2-3 subjects, do not let students to repeat hole standard again.  Students can move up on other subject but they have to take same subject in next semester which they are weak.  Fox example in USA, in same Math class they have different standard of students. 
0 0 Sir this is important. I am attaching a pdf file. 
0 0 Dear PM Sir, As per study Recall after 72 hours of learning we remember just 10% Hear, 20% See,50% See & Hear,70% Verbal Participation,80% Physical Participation and 90% See, Hear and Practice. In short we remember 90% of the things If we learn by doing.This important aspect needs to be shared to all the students in #MannKiBaat# 
0 0 HON PM ModiJi my suggestion is that during the board exams students feel the exam pressure and tension.With students parents get more tensed so my suggestion is that Government should do some workshop or arrange seminar for both parents and students so that the students and parents feel less pressure and students can groom better. 
0 0 Respected Sir, You are doing really good job.  I have some suggestion regarding education. *   Please make two semester system.  Students get less stress and also they can focus more on study. *   Tell parents to not compare your kids with other.  Every students has different types of skills.  Try to understand your kids interest, weak area and give them right guidance.

Learning by doing and Group Learning are the best thing to enhance our knowledge and skills. My Idea is to encourage students for learning by doing and Group Learning. 
0 0 Dear PM Sir. Learning by doing is the best way to remember any subject. I personally have developed low cost home made training kits for science and Mathematics student for conducting various experiment and learn themselves by doing as we remember 90% of things which we hear, see and do with our own hands,

My idea is to promote such initiatives and fund the people with small amount so that talent can be developed locally and at faster rate. 
0 0 I have developed many small useful training kits like learn basic electricity, automation, machining, computer programming, repairing etc. which are low cost and I train local persons free of cost. My idea is to invite such people and fund them with small amount of Rs5000-10,000/- pm. for continuing skill up-gradation of local people.

0 0 Respected Modi Ji. Thank you so much for starting this forum for us to communicate direct with you. We truly appreciate the efforts being put to get this done. In regards to youngsters appearing for exams. First of all, Why do we have to judge kids capability in earlier age. Why can't we remove the exam for child who studies from Jr K.G. to 3rd or 4th standard. Make them first aware of how to be discipline and educate on all basic aspects. Make Sports important subject.

In spite of so many good visionary initiatives  and thoughts the things are not happening with a speed and common citizen is not able to witness rapid changes. Few initiatives like Jan Dhan, Jan Suraksha,Gas Subsidy/ Ujjawala Yojna has bought real and remarkable and good changes in our lives. The initiatives like Digital India/Skill India are going too slow.

0 0 our Honorable PM is requested to give hope on "in future -  Indian way of Traditional education system will be insisted where experiences of a student is very much important than examinations." The language about the subject becomes difficult because of the language of the subject for our students even in PG and Research level. Therefore the language which serves as medium of instruction must be taught and learnt very well... Then surely all Bharath Putra  will conquer the world. 
0 0 Namaskar Mr PM Sir in olden time our country provide free education with the help of Aashram  When the person is free from all responsbilities then he give back their knowledge with experiences to the socity . Now the education is the type of bussiness and thats why our culture which says (vidya dadati vinyam ) is disappeared from the caracter of people .We must take care of our sanskar , sanskrity,culture alive through education to the next generation .

1 0 We are spending a fortune of tax money in Govt.schools and colleges.The system has degenerated and teachers do not teach. They are in look out for private coaching.

1 0 Dear Narendra Modiji, When i used debit card to pay utility bills i also had to pay an extra amount as service tax for using card. When our idea is to  try and move to less cash economy and when i saw people still using cash then i think this may be the one of the reason. If digital payments are going to attract taxes and if anybody will have to pay more than the prescribed bill amount then very less people will use it. Hence please act upon it to encourage digital payment. 
0 0 Respected sir, This is with respect to the Change in evaluation pattern of The CBSE board. The attached PDF contains some of my observations as a parent of two children who are studying in a private school affiliated to the CBSE. 
0 0 Examination preparation is a phycological pressure on students as well as parents also....but in examination time parents role become very important. Parents should take care of their proper diet and to support to boost their confidence. It is  the revision time only and student should solve board questions papers only. 
0 0 Making LEARNING centered education. Making Skill centered education my thought for meaningful exam.. EXPLORE-EXPERIENCE-EXPERIMENT-UNDERSTAND-LEARN 
0 0 Sir, Examinations are important as they evaluate the skill levels of the individuals. But i would very much like the Government to evaluate on the portion being taught in schools. Is it in standards with the standards followed in other countries. Exams should be fun rather than overload. Most important is remove all reservations in grading/passing marks so that we can produce more meritorious students.Impartial grading system is need of the hour. 
0 0 #PMonRadio, #AIR, #MannKiBaat, #MyGov Respected Modiji, To improve our education system please take steps to stop internal assessment marks from all examinations.  Please conduct Common examinations or common entrance examinations after each higher education course with unified syllabus. This will create best youngsters. Give  chance to select 3 or 4 subjects with an vocational subject  of their interest after eighth standard. 
0 0 for those student who are preparing for competitive exam , i just want to say that now its time for revision not studying more new topics. so, keep revising your notes and do practice of pravious years papers to get the knowledge of important topic and learn from your 'MISTAKES' that u commit in solving papers and the important things is to time management both for day and exam so make your shedule and work according to it. and eat health food to stay healthy.#AIR,#MannKiBaat. 
0 0 Exams ka Bhoot Bhagao 1. Be effort oriented and not result oriented 2. Don't compare your preparations with others 3. Prepare a realistic study schedule 4. Do not study for more than 45 minutes in a single stretch 5. Start exam preparations well in advance as last minute preparations increases anxiety 6. Make positive affirmations such as "My memory is good, I have studied well, I will achieve my targeted goals in advance etc" 7. Visualize your goal 8. Remain relaxed all the time 
0 0 Nothing has changed 
0 0 I would request my P.M that please share little story of Swami Vivekananda on power of concentration "when he had remembered not only every topic but the page no also" it will inspire our students to study with more concentration.Also give example of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose "who got 99 marks in maths but his Acharyaji was not happy, his Acharyaji told that I had taught you for 100 marks.You have stolen my 1 mark".Thanking You your's Faithfully. HAPPY REPUBLIC DAY TO EVERY SINGLE INDIAN. 
2 0 i just want to say to the student who are preparing for their exam that don't take stress of anything and make short note of every subject and keep revising them , and for parents i would  like to say that don't force your children to do hard work and never compare your child with any other student because it will hurt your child internaly instead parent's should motivate their child. 
0 0 Should there be a debate to conduct USA SAT like exams in India for college education instead of giving much importance to board exams and entrances? Why the creativity of students is not at all considered for college education except through the entrance or board exams marks? There is no proper measure for determining the skills, talent, and natural skills of a student all over India. Jai Shiva Jai Shri Ram. 
1 0 Modi sir I am Rajendra Kr Hembram studying in BHU Varanasi being a poor santhal tribe I am challenging you that our nation can't bring Olympic medal, Oscar award and development of village without involvement of village talent and skill and village participants.so we should respect the talent and skill.so I want to add one more Jay jawan Jay kisan Jay bigyan and Jay kaushal Jay Bharat

We gave our 3years on college now they are saying you have to leave the college. We dont know what to do We have lost all our hopes. It seems like we dont have any future. Please help us 
0 0 The stress in Education system from childhood should be totally eliminated. Top students may perform well in three language formula and to deal with more and more subjects. How about average students who can't compete out of many subjects at high school level and becoming useless though they may have skills, talent in one particular domain. Education system needs to improve to track the talent,skills gifts at very early age without partiality in the national interest. Jai Shiva Jai shri Ram. 
1 0 We are Indian Citizens, went outside India for few years for job opportunity. Came back fe years ago for good. We work in India, pay taxes here. Our children are born outside India and hence OCI. But they have studied here from 1st standard. These kids after completing 12th education in India need to take admission under the 'NRI Quota' at higher Tuition Fees. We urge the Government to treat our children as Indian Resident to promote equality. 
1 0 Sir, Being a student of class 11 and an aspirant of IIT-JEE it is my keen request to reduce the burden on calss 11 and class 12 students. Despite of reducing burden and shorting syllabus new subjects and rules are being introduce which lefts students in DILEMA. Another major point is vote-bank basedbon reservation system,Being a class 11 student I am not much into it. The result of reservation is breaking moral of GEN category and a speed breaker in pace of country's development.-Vedant N.S. 
1 0 Our nation gives lot of importance to education and skills. But we have to question ourselves why our professionals like scientists, engineers, doctors,writers,leaders are not competing at the international levels? Why we depend on Russian, American,European technologies and even for city planning and relating any complex projects. We have to thankful for the developed nations for their technology,talent and skills and there is an urgent need to improve the standards in Indian education system. 
0 0 respected PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI SIR, nowadays education system is becoming the money based system which was value based earlier. I can not understand why the system has changing in such a way. coming to the examination system frankly speaking that the exam system is also based on rich and poor because the so called rich colleges get the easy of getting out in exams compared to a normal government schools/colleges. just before some days back one MP of AP proved EDU' IS FAKE. 
1 0 "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy". The central hypothesis of the Fueling Learning Through Exercise (FLEX) study is that two innovative school-based physical activity programs will demonstrate improved cognitive functioning, academic achievement, and attendance, relative to controls. Children studying for examinations should continue to play and allot time for physical exercise. 
2 0 Dear PM, I am an engineering graduate from Karnataka,I want to discuss the actual condition of an Engineering graduates in many states of India. 1)The syllabus taught for BE,B.tech etc in most of Indian university's are outdated and Industry's outside the college campus expect a skilled engineer. 2)People born in poor,rural background and born in General cast are the worst sufferers we don't have fees exemption for applying Govt job, We don't have age relaxation etc 
1 0 Dear sir, I would like to bring in notice below point which I feel should be addressed in the education policy eventually it will reduce the exam pressure on the students. 1. Standardise the syllabus across the education boards. Focus should be on what's required TO LIVE THE LIFE. Presently, 90% of education goes on waste in real life. 2. Fix the limit for the weight of the bags for primary kids. Due to school's lust the no. of books are being increased year by year.

0 0 Respected sir, Now a days exams are not the real knowledge test but answering without knowing its relevance & meaning. Most of the teachers and the parents are just interested in scoring the marks but not the knowledge & understanding. Coaching classes and schools coaching for the exams should be prevented. Children should be taught to answer all the questions on their own by understanding. For that mere coaching should be prevented. Most of the schools are just marking the question &answers

More the difference more the young talented back.

Give importance to all the subjects. 4. After each exam don't evaluate, plan for the next.

0 0 Respected Sir, One main point some students miss during the preparation of the examination is the exam orientation. Their preparation must be oriented according to the exam. It is correct that we must explore a topic which we are reading and go deep into it. But during exam preparation also , some students go so deep into the topic that they forget the exam orientation and the importance  of that topic in the examination, hence they have less time for other important topics. 
1 0 Dear Sir, For Teachers- Teachers should treat, support, be warm be sincere towards students,they should help them prepare for exams just as if they are preparing their own child for the exam.

Parents and Students- Weather is changing students to take care by avoiding outside food and cold drinks, stick to healthy diet.

0 0 Sir, Schools need to teach and guide students to face Board exams and other exams like NEET, JEE etc. I suggest Private coaching centers/tution centers are not needed. It is 1.Extra burden to students 2.lack of time to take care health (less sleep, no physical exercises, always pressure) 3. Extra expenses to parents. At present, because of tutions, many schools are not  teaching. Tution going students get good marks compared to others. This trend needs to change.

Go early to the bed, have sufficient sleep, and get up early in the  morning. Before starting studies, a few minutes of deep breathing Pranayam would be of great help. 2. Take regular breaks in between studies. 3. Be regular with studies to avoid last minute rush 4. Relax your mind with some physical exercise/ game everyday. 5. Have limited access of social media.

First of all, the examinations like IIT-JEE, Board exams etc. should be conducted in such a way that it should examine the 'Knowledge' of a candidate rather than his/her physical competence with other students. This can be done in the form of relaxations given to divyangs like more quota in computer science in IIT, writer for more than 80% disabled in all the  exams. #MannKiBaat

0 0 Sir, I request you, for single exam in Philosophy of Doctorate admission, like in Medical(NEET) and in Engineering(AIEEE etc.). Because many times students have keen interest in research do not know how to engaged with an research organisation or university of their interest, due to different admission criteria everywhere. Some institute wants GATE/NET qualified candidates while some some conducted their own written examination, these things creates problems to the students. 
0 0 Respected Sir; Agreeing to the suggestions given by others , I would like to add that , finding suitable job is the biggest hurdle every youngster is facing . The term 'suitable' relates to job opportunity to the person for what he is qualified to and salary based on his qualification. Today me being an engineer, have under gone this phase and have seen many such engineers who work in other jobs for a petty amount. Even if the person gets job in right domin, the growth is limited. 
2 0 Respected sir, as all of us are aware of harsh truth that the cases of suicide among students are increasing. Students can't share their feelings with their parents as in most of cases the pressure to get high marks is from parents only. There is a desi,authentic and affective way to deal with these pressure from our culture that is gita,kuran,bible. Reading them can cure all problem. Also government should make compulsory in schools to teach students about these holy books. 
0 0 Sir During examinations time as a parent should support their wards in a positive manner.They must encourage them and move with friendly aspects. As a student,understand the importance of exam and prepare well. They should not waste time. As a teacher,they must motivate their students and especially they must take care of weak students and give attention to them.

0 0 Good afternoon PM sir, Iam from Bangalore and very proud to share my thought with a man who has always with a lot of strong messages, decisions and is restless to do more & more for our nation. Sir Iam a father of 12 th std student and with forthcoming board exam. My thought is that 'the time has come to take strong step to control/stop the growing tuition system as parallel running with upperclass school edn'. Parents, Students and Teachers are in confusion & unable to achieve good results. 
0 0 I have of course written a lot of exams and now , my children do. While exams, do help students learn, the way they are constructed, sometimes it seems your luck is tested as much as your knowledge. I have also found teachers not encouraging originality.It is a stressful time, for all.  I hope something can be done to make education seem like something to help people learn and grow rather than just acquire certificates. 
0 0 very good. 
0 0 Hello ! Some time back I was trying to find educational videos on youtube to teach my younger brother some concepts of mathematics and that's when I came across ExamFear.com They have all the CBSE content for free available on their website and youtube channel. I think it will help many other students :) 
0 0 Dear Hon. Modi sir Season's Greetings & happy republic day well in advance, just wish to attached news cutting message in addition to my previous e-mail, kindly consider the same pertain to reservation system in Indian education at present with warm regards pawan kumar kotiyal 
0 0 Dear Sir, Your emphasis for the Public sector research institutions to encourage students have been complied only on paper, with their sites putting encouraging messages for internship but nil response is there on application by students. Need to transform this into actionable reality. Sir,student fee subsidy/reservation on caste basis even by financial sound parents needs to be appealed to voluntarily give up the subsidy for better channelising of funds. P S Rao, Gandhinagar 
0 0 At this age most of the children’s loosing concentrations, distracted from milestones  & mentally imbalanced due to unusual (porn, anti national videos, anti social activities) material seen by him or her on internet or social media & this leads to increasing IN CRIME RATE BY CHILD’S.. So my suggestion is “SOME KIND OF AGE CONTROL, PARENTAL CONTROL & FILTERS ARE REQUIRED ON WEBSITES, SEARCH ENGINES AND OPEN INTERNET SOURCES” SAVE FUTURE & INDIAN CULTURE 
0 0 Hon. Sir Please see attachment. 
7 0 We urge the Government to treat our Children, who are Resident OCI, after their Higher Secondary Board Exams, at par with Indian Nationals, in the process of admission to the professional graduation and post-graduation courses offered by all the national, state level government aided and privately run Institutes, uniformly. This will promote equality and will encourage the aspiring professionals to serve building our nation dutifully. 
1 0 Dear Sir,  Education is becoming very costly and all our thoughts/energy are getting wasted on constantly thinking this.  Kindly look into this matter and bring a system in place where there is a restriction and regulation on private schools charging high fees in schools and colleges.  No question of saving some money for the future if we have two kids studying in a private school.  Thanks. 
0 0 Respected Sir, Kindly consider to change our educational system and timing as well. also private institutes charges on students. 
0 0 sir, they are trying to detain children who had learning disability though the board accepts them with concessions, the schools in order to get a 100% first class result , trying to keep them in 9th or 11th itself so that their results will not be affected. This demoralizes the child and many commit suicide or go into depression, hence the school managements are to be warned against this kind of discrimination 
0 0 Sir Please see the attachment 
0 0 Namaskaar Respected PM ji, Youngesters.... 1. Set your target cautiously. Wrong target will result n wrong result. 2. Don't read selective, cover entire syllabus. 3. NCERT books/ books recommended by State board are must read. Board papers are always set from these books only. 4. Must read examples given in books. 5. Practice by writing only. 6. For a paper of 3 hrs. duration, practice to sit and write continuously for at least 4 hrs. 7.Must have breakfast/light food before exam. Thanks

0 0 Entire Education System is in shambles since the Ministry of Human Resources (Department of Education) is unable to monitor and control either the corrupt University Grants Commission or the Universities or the affiliated Colleges, etc. There is rampant corruption and nepotism in Admission procedures, and also in the Examination systems. Our adorable Prime Minister has failed on his Promise "naa hi khane doonga" --due to lack of administrative experience, qualifications and vision of Ministers 
0 0 Hon. PM Sir, The biggest issue which students must tackle during exam time is fear. It has direct bearing not only to performance in exams but also self-worth. Every student is much more concerned about his/her future than parents know of. They not only want to be part of nation building in future but also need recognition. Some students can cope with this fears but others find it difficult. Those who cannot, a word of encouragement and assurance that they will not be left behind will help. 
0 0 Sir, It is required to be free in education current system bind us. We are just passed with questions which are never solved. There are some terms which should be changed. So we can study free to help country,instead of just passing exams for job.

0 0 Teachers must act as Lord Krishan in lives of their students and motivate Arjuns ( Students ) to work without tension of results of success or failure. To students - I would like to suggest , be hard-workers and honest. Do not copy or imitate others , try to create something in any field. Observe , learn , listen , read , play , contemplate as much as you can. Respect time , respect elders. Albert Einstein had said that "A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new". 
0 0 Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi sir namaskar my name is Hithesh T V from Mekeri village Madikeri Taluk Kodagu district Karnataka I'm studying Engineering in kvg college of engineering Dakshina Kannada district Karnataka Sir I have made a project which is based on problem arising from Technology the whole world is in under this problem.This problem is mainly found in telecommunication sector and India is in 114 place.so I want to meet you to discuss about this problem & I have solution 
0 0 Teachers must always teach the students the lessons of hard-work and honesty. The life of a student with the wheels of hard-work and honesty will surely reach to the expected goals of the life. Be fair to all students , share your experiences. Keep broad options of career in their lives. Do not stick to limited options in career-making. Tell them that the world is an ocean of opportunities , just be confident and grab the best opportunity. 
0 0 Exams are stressful times for students,  when competition is increasing and demands from parents are also high. I would suggest schools should have extra tution provisions for clearing doubts even if it is with some fee. Secondly,  the carrer counselling should start in school from pre HSC levels to give direction to individual aspirations. 
0 0 Just provoke your kids to work hard. In Sri MadBhagwad Geeta - The Karam is considered the best irrespective of the result of the Karams done. All players in a game , do not win , only one wins , it does not indicate that other players should not play. Try for better. If your kids will prepare for exams with free minds , they will certainly do better. For the teachers -- I would like to suggest that they should teach lessons of hard-work and honesty to your students. 
0 0 respected sir i witnessed suggestions pour in however discarded requested to the gov that reduce the prevailing inequalities and corrupt practices in the following fields which are divided into several underground layers of social economic divisions education ---no unique system has been found i though an ignou student thus unemployed. people --divide and rule policy. i could suggest to remove prevailing inequalities and bring development in the field concerned.call me! 
0 0 Higher Education should be subsidised completely to enhance the intellectual capital of our country. Presently only the rich can afford top institutions and become richer. Skills are a must, but should come with a degree to enhance employment opportunities. The disparity in income may reduce when higher education becomes completely subsidised for all i.e no tuition fee. Economically weak may send their children to school when higher education is also free. 
0 0 The examination days are drawing near - some students are excited and some are in fear. As a parent - I would like to advise the parents/guardians of the students that never pressurize your wards to bring high percentage in exams. Just motivate them to do good and try for better but never expect high performance from your wards. It will mentally tease the students and if you do not get expected results , you too will be depressed. in depression , you will scold your child and spoil your image 
0 0 Respected Pm you are working proper and very good 
0 0 The PM shall try to elucidate on focusing and dedicating one's psyche entirely to education. Examinations are taken or given to catch the exceptions,anomalies or loopholes in one's knowledge.It makes us know the areas where we are fallacious and that which most necessarily needs care and attention.Examinations should be taken in a spirit of finding the erroneous points in our knowledge and not simply in a materialist light i.e. simply with an intention to get good grades . 
0 0 Education shapes a nation. Strenuous study reveals where we are especially weak at.When the examinations come very close, we get tensed and this makes us all the more focused at work.However,deviations from study play the most vital role in deciding one's fate.During this period ,it is greatly difficult to acclimatize our mind to the environs that seem precarious and perilous.Time seems to fleet bit by bit.With hardly a month left behind the board exams , it is becoming obsessing ,to cope up.

0 0 Respected PM of India, Why can't we bring in best practices of educational system across the world? In Singapore, board examinations are evaluated by whole staff by providing one week holidays to the whole children in that school. Written examination have only ~50% scoring, Student's communicational skills, behaviour, sports, general knowledge, current affairs etc are being evaluated. Can we adapt the below actions as a start.... Till 7 years no written exam in any schools 
0 0 There must be a kind of self assessment test every year mandatory for every teacher. Very often we come to know that a teacher is not able to answer the basic questions related to their subject. If they don't know these basic thing what they will teach to their students. So it must be mandatory for teacher to pass that performance test every year to make sure that they know what they are supposed to teach their student. Also please remove caste based reservation at least from education system.

1 0 The first thing each and every parent may like to know is that the parents are the best judge of the capabilities and working methods, and  the biggest well wishers of  their respective children.

I am sure, the youngsters will 
1 0 Our Lovely PM Sir, Most Important point to be taken care by candidate is " No fear of failure". Most of the students have fear of failure while appearing for exams. They should forget about their past failure and have faith on themselves. I will my example in this case : Even though I have got 39% marks in Higher Secondary, I have cleared Chartered Accountancy Final Exams. 
1 0 sir we should take steps towards quality education and removal of reservation based on cast 50% reservation does not make any sense. And  it is not good for the developing India.teachers must use some creativity while teaching if the teaching is creative than only the students are creative. teachers have to pay attention on very individual student.Our education system need some instant changes like to make education interesting and creative. our primary classes need improvement and focus. 
2 0 Dear PM, Please give the examples like of Einstein [a great scientist] was never class topper, then successful person like Bill Gate was university dropout but many such peoples are successful in their real life.

So dear students please be pressure free, and try to succeed in life real examinations than in class examinations. Sincerely Anurag 
0 0 Honorable Prime Minister, As a teacher and a paper evaluator, I wish to put forth the following comment to the students. Please convey the same on my behalf As far as possible, write answers to questions in chronological sequence only. For e.g. write Ans. 2 after Ans. 1, then Ans 3, so on and so forth. Leave some space for Ans. 2 if you don't know. Then come back later and answer it. If you write answers in random order, you are confusing the evaluator, who may forget to add up some marks.

Every morning when I drive to my work, I see most of the school bus drivers and private school cab drivers very rashly and jumping red lights.I think if we will teach/educate our children to ask them to stop their driver to jump red lights.I also have 2 children and really felt about Etawah school bus accident. Thank for all you are doing for our Nation. Jai Hind 
0 0 Dear sir, First thing  you changed the system of education by starting with practical and then come to theory  and not reverse . Also education should  make student self dependent , whcih is not happening right now , Remove all  reservation for marks for getting admission , in  todays world does it really make sense . Education minister should be from IITian with  IIM background , who understand the education need with management skills . Teach for India can give good inputs here. 
0 0 प्रधानमंत्रीजी मेरा ये सुझाव है कि शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में हमें सबसे ज्यादा सुधार की जरूरत बेसिक और मध्यमिक स्तर पर है। मुझे ये लगता है कि इस समय इस स्तर पर रटने पर ही कक्षाओं में ज़ोर दिया जाता है न कि उनके तार्किक ज्ञान पर। हमें आज आवश्यकता है कि उनका व्यावहारिक ज्ञान भी बढ़ाया जाय और इसके लिए आवश्यकता है कि इस स्तर पर प्रयोगसाला और पुस्तकालयों की भी स्थापना भी स्कूलों में की जाय। गिरिजा शंकर (B.Ed., M.Sc., M.Tech.) ग्रा.- जफरपुर पो.-सुरहुरपुर जिला-अंबेडकरनगर पिन -224159 उत्तर प्रदेश 
0 0 Sir.. I have seen many little students very early dressed in their school uniform waiting for their school buses. please make the school timing at prime time throughout the year i.e. 9 AM to 3 PM.

1 0 My sister got AIR 716 in Aipmt2015 and secured admission in BYL Nair Hospital, Mumbai. Her friend who got AIR~1000 couldn't get admission due to lack of seats. However a 'reserved category' candidate (not economically backward) whose marks are worse than an AIR10000 student and whose basic concepts of biology are also not clear secured admission easily. Is this fair? What kind of doctor is he gonna be? Aren't you compromising health of citizens? Does 51% caste based reservation make any sense? 
0 0 Must talk topics- 1. Government schools quality- if all high level bureaucrats are made to send their wards in KV and central school then their quality will automatically get better. 2.

The activites, which are giving to the children are in a way that they should be helpfull to develop the child's overall personality develepment 
0 0 Dear Sir, I have few suggestions and concerns w.r.t to education system. 1. Schooling should start only after age of 5, focusing on health, self defence and moral values. 2. There should be only one Board for all schools " one country one school". 3. Nursery,UKG, LKG etc should be scraped. 4. school should not be allowed to take original birth certificate. 5. Fees, book, uniform should be one for all govt schools. 6. Teachers should be well payed so they can focus on education.

This is  what your best new year gift to Students and Parents. Thank you, I remain. 
0 0 Honourable Prime Minister! It is not outcome based education the youth needed but it is value and ethical based education.   What I strongly believe is that one subject ought to be introduced on value-ethical based along with an hour a week for sports and an hour for arts where the student experiences the joy of hardworking, creative thinking and learns winning strategies and implements in his own life. and the above said subject shapes his overall attitude which  develops a dreamed nation.

1 0 Respected sir, I am in the final year of my graduation and want to pursue LLB after it; so I could help in building a crime free India. But there is a problem cause I belong to a middle class family and the college is nearly 25-26 km far away from my village. I can't go there regularly,not because it is too far but because it s not safe.Tell me what should I do? And my parents aren't allowing me to take Education Loan(they think it's waste of money) but in my Marriage they surely would.

0 0 Res Sir, This is regarding JEE advance exam. I followed your office and HRD office for providing ladies quota for admissions in Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) through JEE advance exam. Just few days back we come to know that there will be 20% reservation for the ladies for the admissions in IIT. Thank you. However, this year it will be implemented in IIT Delhi only. I request you to provide ladies quota from this year only in all IITs for the betterment of girls as it was long due.

0 0 For CBSE exam of class 10, there are three sets of questions for each exam with varying index of difficulty. The set of question a student gets is based on luck. This has to be changed into uniform set. Will it not be wise to have a uniform syllabus throughout India giving every child an opportunity to learn the same content Education should better be under the purview of government alone and teachers be recruited through competitive exams as they aare moulding the pillars of this country 
0 0 Respected Prime Minister, sir I am a Private teacher. In my opinion . agar hum student ko piratical shikha dea saktea to acha hota. like if we want to measure a cube then only we calculate it mathematically but we did not measure it piratically therefor students are forgot it in the exam. In history we only Reade past things which we never seen but if we seen this we rememberer it. how to seen ? we seen it as a movie or like a serial in the class room. as a result student a more attactive

0 0 Respected PM We all are thankful to you that you have taken this topic of discussion in "Man ki Baat".I have a humble request to you more & more attentions should be given on the grass root level of education.At present scenario the students don't have enough basic knowledge about the practical fields of life,all the students are just running in race,no one is worried about the knowledge,they all are only running for win,that's it. Make aware the school education about the concepts of study 
0 0 My observation is on Food distribution system under Food Securities Act of Government of India in our state West Bengal, North 24 Parganas is worst. Maximum number of Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) Ration Card holders are not poor as they pretend to be. The quality of food is very poor, so they are using this food for their pets, as they are not in (BPL).AAY Ration Card provided to this group of People by the Political influence because they will cast vote and provide advantages to the ruling party 
0 0 Dear Sir, You are doing a great job.But lets talk about the youngsters.Today's youth are getting distracted and we are terrorizing ourselves.The number of crimes are actually increasing.Sir ,I request you to take certain steps for the betterment of our nation by focusing on youths.Today's Youth must not only be educated by formal Education but also by Moral education.I think the Books written by Shree Swami Vivekananda must be distributed in Educational institutes for INDIA's betterment. 
0 0 1. Students should not take stress about the exam and should do meditation 2 to 3 times a day to relax mind. This will also help to improve their graspping power. 2. Regular study throughout the year helps them to achieve good percentile in exam. They should understand the subject instead of just memorizing it. 3. They should take light food, drink plenty of water and also do other activities like playing, gossiping, watiching TV etc. apart from study to relax mind.

1 0 Pradhan Mantri ji ko hamaara Namashkaar, Mera yeh aap se vinti hai ki Shiksha ko competetion ka bazar na banaaya jaaye balki Gyan ka Bhandaar banaya jaaye. Bacchon ko exams men ananad mehssos hona chahiye naa ki ghabraahat. Shiksha Vyastha aisi banaayi jaaye ki Vidyarthi school jaane ke liye betaab ho. Fees adhik naa ho, Donation ka sanskaar samaapt ho, tutions classes band ho. Teachers qualified ho jo acchhi shiksha de paayen jinpar Students Garva kar sake aur exams dene mein unhe anand aaye. 
1 0 Respected PM Sri. Narendra Modiji, Kindly tell students that exams are not so important. Children should learn in a very peaceful manner. All these exams are bringing stress in the minds of children. We have reached a situation where children are focusing only exam not on improving the knowledge. We have hear lot of children/students commit suicides because of failed in the exams. Exams are not important for child. We need to change the old British way of dealing every thing. 
0 0 Respected Prime Minister, We know the sunlight scatters in all the directions. The scattered light cannot burn a piece of paper. But the same light when we made it pass through a convex lens, it burns a piece of paper. Because the total energy of light is converged at a point. The student should focus on academics. A cow has a good quality called rumination. The student should recall the academic content all the time except while sleeping. perseverance is the secret of success. 
0 0 Respected Modiji, Project given by school need to be completed in schools only and school want it to get done at home .  It lost children's play time. There should be a Sports school from std I like koria, Japan and china to have a healthy generation of India. 
0 0 I am delighted that our beloved Prime Minister, who is thinking 24 X 7 about all of us in the country has chosen examination about children very aptly and timely.  Sir, examination/competition creates discrimination among children.  Every children is unique and our present exam system does not follow a pattern to identify the uniqueness of each child.  Hence my suggestion is to please follow a process where we can be able to identify those potentials with each individual and feel proud. Biren

0 0 First we should focus on education system which is completely british , this system focused on Degree not for education , so this would create the tension for student and their parents .  the education system should be such " which not disturb parents "   mind please no scientist in the world can focused on all subject ..........  so first we should focused on system 
0 0 Being a Parent I want to share my problem. For student of Std. IV to VIII schools assigns many projects which students can not complete of their own. Some topics are so hard and students can not complete it and parents has to complete the  whole things.  Being a working parents it's difficult to arrange time in working days.  School also expect projects to be done with attractive presentation along with quality contain. Please give surprise visit and see whether students can do project alone. 
0 0 Private owned schools force parents to buy uniform, books and stationary from school itself that on Maximum Retail Price (MRP). Its not a hidden fact but still no action from government has been taken. Also, all private schools are free to decide fees amounts, annual charges etc. Is it allowed under some law of government of India?? Schools have published that each pupil has to pay fees under this law but what about deciding fees amounts???

0 0 Before making entrance exams such as NEET/JEE mandatory, please ensure that all state board curriculums and syllabuses have been upgraded. This will remove the anxiety of thousands of aspiring students studying in state board schools, as the students will not have to join any extra classes or private coaching centres to prepare for the examinations. 
0 0 up to 3 standard maximum subject regarding nation love, good manners , duty to the nation, duty to the society. 
0 0 Dear All, Exam time is the best time of education, To most of the students Firstly I Congratulate and wish them All the Best In Advance, Just like our Gurukul Culture I would first advice students to avoid oily & Heavy foods which will slow down digestive system, Remember if the digestive system is under load the brain will concentrate more on digestive system, Have Plenty of water to have proper ionic and free blood flow, this helps you in memorising Secondly Avoid late night studies. 
0 0 Government Schools all over India needs dedicated attention and focus. Central schools owned by government have better facilities than other government schools due to reason that government employees children get education but what about general public of country because of whom government is there. Education in society will transform our society and way of living. 
0 0 In developed countries like USA and UK, they conduct common test for all students those who clear either 10th/12th standard, if they clear the exam, they can join with the universities they like most irrespective of their basis studies, for example a commerce student can study science/engineering course, similarly a science student can study any commerce, cost accounting,company secretary and LAW courses, but it is not a case in India, why don't we think of that sort and implement in India. 
0 0 Sir,I am very happy because sir I never seen like our priminister and lthink now our country more progress and developed.I thanked from my heart to our priminister. 
0 0 To release our youth of stress of exams Syllabus should made more flexible and multi choice questions should be there like do any 10 questions out of 20. 
0 0 The present education system lack civic sense and character building. Syllabus up to VIII standard contain tough study material. Which confuse students as to for what they are getting this education. Education should relate to knowledge which we need in our day to  day routine life and not like that we want to be specialized in all fields. Then a Cardiologist will not be a cardiologist rather he will not be able to treat cardiac patients nor ortho patients. Our educated youth violate rules. 
0 0 Sir, Somewhere our schools are losing the ability to motivate the children for education and preps for the exams. especially the Board exams. Result is a phobia for the Boards amongst the students. I suggest that curriculums for Std X and XII should be amended to have more participation of school in Board exam preparation, guidance, encouragment, which will be part of Board exam internal marks also. This way Students would be motivated and we also reduce the cases of depressive incidents. 
0 0 Sir, Please ask the students not to take tension. Our teachers used to say ""Exams are not Kumbh Ka Mela Jo 12 Saal me ek Baar Aayega"", it will come on every year. If something wrong happens this year; don't worry give it (exam) next year. There is nothing great will happen if you loose one year in life. Life it beautiful enjoy it. Don't worry about exams. Do your work and don't take tension of result. God will do justice with every body. 
1 0 Students appearing academic exams should think that they are only answering questions as per their course curriculum and not taking exams for the very good values which they have.Always errors/failures are part of real life and these can be solved by your real good qualities that you have built up within you during your young/childhood period.So parent should not be very much worried academic failure of their children, rather they should always give more emphasis on developing noble values 
0 0 Exams are meant to test the overall development of a person. But it is never a measure to actually see the true potential, rather it is just a measure for how can one react in the situation when you know something and you can do it or not, which is again dependent on the situation and hence it is just a common perspective. The overall development is a personal task and hence it does not need to be shown off for just the world but it should be done to gain knowledge, rest of things will follow. 
0 0 Students who have been preparing for the exam through out the year will have to increase their effort during this last phase of the academic year.Success will be theirs.Students who have NOT prepared for their exams so far and have wasted their precious time through out the year,such students should understand that it is still NOT too late.There is a Proverb in English "If you TRY you might, but if you DON'T you won't".Take up tough subjects first and do better time management.Its still not too 
0 0 for students - "Once you entered the exam hall, take a long breath and relax.  When you get the paper in your hand don't be panic.  Read all the paper first and start writing whichever question you can answer quickly and once you settled down after writing the answer of first question you selected, then automatically you will get a spirit to write/solve all the remaining paper.  All the very Best." Thank you Sir for sharing with you. Rekha Vaidya 
0 0 Time management is one of the major factor in Examinations. Students should understand on how to manage time properly. For this, the teachers should guide them from the beginning of the year. Teachers should show them what kind of questions they have to write first how much time they have to spend for that and how to write precisely and clearly. They have to students in Time management. Attached are few more tips for students from my view point. 
1 0 sir,preparation for exam is a continuous process not just a time being exercise, hence it should be  adopted by students that repeat your learning of the day in evening every day without failure, it will build up confidence and clarity in all text and basic concept.

0 0 Hello Sir, I will take this opportunity to share the thoughts of medical students, as I have been a part of it and now, though I have crossed all those entrance exams and working as a Doctor in Kolhapur city, I always wonder, that how can a 90 or 120 minutes' exam, with 200 or 300 multiple choice questions (MCQs), which are based on 4.5 years of 14 subjects syllabus, judge a Medical student's capability if they are eligible for further studies? Infact,India needs more and more specialist Doctors
