14 1 their are many layers of job. Consider a point, we have a ore extracting area in a region and we sell ores to foreign countries and make some money. What if we  introduce some plants that purifies these ores as per the foreign demands. we will make more money then previous and also create more job opportunities. what if we can add more industries like industries that can make those raw materials which are being made by other industries in foreign countries we can help in their demands and earn. 
3 1 This way if we setup these plants as mentioned in my previous discussion we can have the skills, technology and money for our growth. We can create more opportunities for Indians. their are people who would oppose the Idea. Its because they think their monopoly over their field is being taken away. But, till when they want to be under government protection policies. They should compete in their field fair and square. It is better to have more layers of job then a single layer. continue... 
3 1 For making the foreign companies to setup their plants India we should reduce our custom duty rates a little and ask them to setup their plants in India with r and d department. We can ask them to create cars in Indian taste low maintainance and high effecieny and green going. If they Can sell cars to comman Indian folks at cheaper rates to its a great idea. They can also have the right to sell their car to other countries by giving extra duty on the cars they sell outside. 
2 0 I think We should attract more of the foreign industries to setup their plants in India. For Example, Take a company mercedez benz is opening a plant in India. A lot of Job scope is made for people not only in the assembly area but also in the area for producing the raw material for the car. These company will bring new technology and help providing new skills to the Indian people on various fields including increasing the opportunities for other companies to fill their raw product demands. 
1 1 If one shop is opened in a city like coimbatore it would gives at least a job for many directly and indirectly. example wood work, electrical work, glass work, transport, and counter sales men and women, accounts officer, electrocnic gadgets, advertisement and so on. It will give business to ele, wood, electr, industries too. BUT IF THE SAME TRADE IS TAKING PLACE ONLINE IT WOULD SWALLOW THOSE EMPLOYMENT CHANCES. eXCEPT GOVT TRANSACTION EVERY DISTRIBUTION MUST BE OFFLINE. 
2 1 can we make the Yoga/Meditation/Pranayama… certification as a mandatory for all the government sectors jobs (at entry level and each promotion level). If possible private sector Jobs as well…especially IT related Jobs Benefits: This will create a new employment for thousands of people (Yoga Trainers) It creates a healthy environment and Helps to overcome many physical/mental diseases. By This process we can spreads the awareness about yoga and we can support to our Ancient Indian Art. 
2 0 Dear sir An initiative large scale should made on curbing  polythene covers/bags  and research and funding should made on emergency basis to  clear and decomposting of existing bags thrown as a garbage.

8 2 Respected Sir, Here I would like to request to encourage citizen in Mann ki Baat program to use Chukkad in place of Plastic Glass for drinking of water & tea. In marriages and tea stall there is lots of consumption of Plastic Glasses and it causes huge ammount of harm to our mother earth. If people will use Chukkad in place of plastic glass it will not be only environment friendly but it will also strenthen the pity economical condition of Kumhar Comunity. A step towars Sustainable Develpment.

1 1 2/2- Basic guideline books published by DGS&D continued to be main procurement guide. After a stage auction of services both purcahse by GOvt or sales (such as RF spectrum, coal blocks etc)has proped in.  As such, the way government buys or sells goods or services or resources is different. Only rate contract may be required, which can be merged with BIS ( a new commercial wing can be created) so that both quality & price aspects can be taken care. DGS&D can be closed, in my opinion. 
0 0 DGS&D: Dte Gen of Supply & Disposal. I starting interacting with it when, I think son-in-law of former PM LB Sastri was its DG. It used to be the central agency for acquisition of stores within India and abroad. It had a office in UK and a strong office in Calcutta. Only Rly & defence were outside its procurement ambit. Soon in 1980's, all other central departments also started procuring directly. It was more or less reduced to Rate Approval agency so that off hand purchase can  be done. 1/2

0 0 Respected Modi Sir, Congress (Center and State) Involved in falsely branding a HINDU as a TERRORIST (highly suspecting, as the lie used for this is "I Hate Muslims", I suspect, this is vote bank politics played by Congress)to conceal GE's involvement. When Congress was in Center,aMNC IT company by name GE had raised false complaints, during 2011-12, in the center through which they were able to involve central police in my life. Sir, please help me! please make this victim fight for justice. 
0 0 Dear Modiji, There are so many people in the country who struggle for a one-time meal. France has established a rule wherein all leftover food/food not sold should be given to the needy. We can start a similar system here in India and apply this on FMCG not sold in retail stores! This will put pressure on retailers to sell their goods at very low rates! 
1 0 Plz see....JI 
0 0 Implement a quota system, wherein at least 35% of commodities are sourced from within the country, 35% from either of Brazil, Russia, South Africa (friendly nations within BRICS). This will ensure Tenders are NOT large sized, ensuring issues like over dependency upon few big suppliers is removed, improve transparency and trust, as big tender can influence pricing and may give rise to Conflict of Interest. Further, entrepreneurs can benefit as everyone's invited to support the supply chain system 
0 0 DGSD: All standard chemicals,Spares & fittings like electrical,mechanical,instruments etc can be fixed as a rate contract which will give cost reduction as well as to improve the timely procurement like Just in time, or to avoid the stock out situation. Simplifies the procurement process, but improves the timely material need. 
0 0 DGS&D: Direct import of chemicals may give price advantage than indg. supply. DGSD may focus the prices of standard chemicals procurement from direct import and fix the prices as rate contract, may give price  advance when considering all govt. purchase which can save more cost. DGS&D can focus on foreign procurement also,which turn simplify the lead time of procurement  with the price advantage. The DGSD chemicals also well informed to the Excise and custom dept.by DGSD which help to clearance. 
0 0 DGS&D:Fixing of Rate Contract by DGS&D, simply the ordering procedure and enhance the timely delivery of materials to institute will help the timely requirement of research institutes which in result improve the focus on research, with the material availability. Help the scientific group to show the result or invention in the faster way. 
0 0 By fixing the Rate Contract centrally by DGS&D, Price benefit,ie more  discount can be obtained from price list by considering the all govt. purchase all over India.Advantage: Reduces the cost (cost benefit),reduced the process time, tendering,etc, reducing the lead time of procurement, easy ordering by referring the rate contract,timely delivery, reduces the lead time of procurement,supplier can not offer different different prices to different different org(org. to org) etc. 
0 0 DGS&D:All Research Institutes are using Branded Chemicals. Rate contract can be fixed by DGS&D for all branded chemicals based on  standard discount structure from the suppliers price list every financial year. The same centrally fixed DGSD discount structure along with the price list,other commercial terms and conditions to be posted and circulated thru the portal which can be used by all govt. org.purchase. 
0 0 It should be tender based. 
0 0 Dgs&d   implement  for   agriculture  field.Dgs&d implement  for  farmers. 
1 0 DGS&D has the best domain expertise and should use marketplace approach and not a software led approach. DGS&D should a. Become a preferred partner for facilitating buy/sale of goods under rate contract for all the government and government enterprises b. Follow principles of efficient price setting of rate contracts c. Should create a membership database of its empanelled suppliers/ buyers like any other marketplace d. Ensure : membership dev,risk mgt, price discovery & trade fulfillment 
0 0 DGS&D should use existing expertise in e-markets available with institutions like NeML to create a easily accessible efficient e-marketplace hvaing national reach based on true market principles of transparency, real-time, online, verifiable and auditable market. 
0 0 government departments Should start using ERP system for inventory the actual quantity of goods received should tally with the quantity billed. People secure tender by quoting less price per kg/tonne and then supply less quantity and take full payment. There is a need to make a change in this mechanism where in the special ERP system. Eg use of bar code system for purchase or goods inward. 
0 0 Sir, I think the yearly budget should be broken down to quarterly buckets for departments as per their needs. And the departments will loose the money of they don't spend in that quarter. To get the money back there should be approval process for the departments. This can ensure the speed we are looking forward to for development. This combined with transparent procurement can do wonders. Regards Bharat Thosar 
1 0 The entire proceedings should be web based, the localisation of the same should be accessible in the public domain. The stakeholder will be accountable. 4th March 2016 
1 0 Perpetually the Department of Supplies and Disposal has earned a bad name all these years. Most of the suppliers complain about prompt payment. It both hurts the quality and promptness of the products agreed to be supplied. During the Financial year the expenditure is 10%,20%,30% and 40% per cent in the four quarters of the year. It needs to be regulated. Rushing purchases at the fag end of the year is disastrous. Strict quality control from experts is necessary. 
0 0 Further to my comment on ERP System (SAP Ariba), Suppliers can see the status of Goods Delivered and status of initiated payment as per the agreed payment terms in the Contract/Purchase Order.  Implementing automated payment processing system will help in crediting the payment to supplier's account as per payment terms thereby having transparency in all transactions.  All transaction right from Purchase Requisition/Quotation from supplier to payment are done online. 
0 0 In my opinion Government of India can explore options of implementing an ERP System (Eg. SAP Ariba) for taking care of procurement needs.  This application provides excellent collaboration between Customers and Suppliers and can be operated with minimum or no training. Can be accessed from anywhere on Mobile/Tablets.  Items can be maintained in Centralized database, Centralized contracts can be created by DGS&D, the same can be used to place Purchase Orders. We get real time status of delivery.

This country needs very strong leader to grow and to change. pleaee do not get influenced by other party else you are counted in one of the failure goverment. People can digest price hikes bt deshdroh...never.......jai hind 
0 0 Sir . I dont understand under what pressure the goverment has released the jnu defaulters. You should have dismissed the jnu administration and should have given authority to police to rule jnu untill things are in control. This might give a clear idea to all school nd university to know their limits. Why nd how these guys are released , is not acceptable as responsible goverment. 
0 0 Dear sir, the design of current wesite do not allow to directly share the thoughts on current affairs going in india. I suggest to have something where we should not consider title of ghe foruM but it should have direct flexibility provide ideas. 
0 0 A few days back I wrote to the Commerce Secretary, madam, who in turn had forwarded my offer to design and implement the Procurement Portal. This email was forwarded to the concerned JS, who was very kind to forward to the DG(DGS&D)and undersigned a email in which I must meet the DG DGS&D. I immediately wrote back that appointment may be given. I sent him this email on 15th February, 2016. Today is 3rd march 2016. I have yet to get an appointment. very sad. i await the appointment. 
0 0 It will be more efficient if we can implement this process along with one of the process (I have already shared couple of times on blog but no luck) if some one responsible or reading my blog from concern person, I have already drafted an IDEA to implement along with DGS&D. Please let me know if I need to share my IDEA. I will prefer to share on private blog.

Babus are ruthless as they pay "Protection Money" to......? for Posting/ Promotion/ Permit... Administrations Reform is a Must, 2)Farmers suicide can get reduced, by encouraging them to sell their farm products on Railways to commuter & roads to motorists, also we need more Passenger Train, to help farmers to sell farm products, to nearby Towns. 
0 0 It’s time to change things, as per my view it’s time to take some decision towards it & let we ask Government to make Doordarshan as a regulatory body for all Television Media. Since Doordarshan is autonomous, and India's Central Government founded public service broadcaster, a division of Prasar Bharati. They will become the regulatory body for all Private Channels, this will not only make centralize control on contents of the Programs, as per nation interest but generate more revenue for Govt. 
0 0 I HAVE SUGGESTION FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. PLEASE START PUTTING UP DESALINATION PLANTS AROUND ALL THE COASTAL AREAS FOR IMPROVING DRINKING WATER SUPPLY. MAY BE LITTLE COSTLY BUT WATER WILL BE AVAILABLE AT LEAST FOR DRINKING. MORE OVER THROUGH THE DESALINATION PROCESS, WE CAN GET GOOD SEA SALT AND SEA MINARALS. IN MAHARASHTRA AND OTHER DROUGHT PRONE REGIONS, WE CAN SUPPLY WATER TO THEM THROUGH PIPELINES. WE SHOULD NOT DIG WELLS WHEN THERE IS FIRE. PLEASE SEE THE EXAMPLE OF GULF COUNTRIES. 
0 0 MSME UNITS MUST BE GIVEN MORE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS MEETINGS OF DGS&D ON VARIOUS PROCUREMENTS IN ALL GOVT. DEPT. 
0 0 full transparency to be brought. also, Accountability of each and every officer be introduced. 
0 0 I agree that you would set up e Procurement portal which would bring in transparency mostly to the interested parties. But for common people it is important to know where and how much have been procured and used. 
0 0 Govt.take total control of goods movement raw and finished by electronics (terminals).Build a network for purchase, sales, manufacturing. 
1 0 Dear Sir, I wish to suggest that all housing societies in Delhi NCR must adopt Solar Energy system for the lights and lift operations. Usually the residents pay for the use of lights in the common area and the electricity consumed by the lifts/elevators. This could be eliminated if the government issues a mandate that all housing societies and residential complexes adopt solar system for energy saving. This will be a big relief for the salaried middle class people. Looking forward to it Sir. 
0 0 The biggest blunder in union budget is ignoring Solar n wind energy sector which needed much awaited boost for carbon-free energy as spoken by bill gates in his blog. Still have time if FM can consider FDI in this greenhouse project that can help institutions to be self-sufficient, provided Govt policy opens up and provide at least 50% subsidy in this sector, specifically for ON-GRID installation that will supply power to Marketing COs.

Ask the apaproved vendor to give declaration that they are  not related to any Bureaucrat/ Minister/ MP or MLA and they will not give subcontract to these if awarded the Govt contract. The registration must be reviewed every three years. Apply KYC norms 
0 0 Our prime minister is a visionary who is trying his best to take India to new highs in spite of all false criticisms from opposition parties and bad press. Sir, I have two suggestions:- 1)A national campaign is needed to prevent the adulteration of food stuffs and ensure consumers get unadulterated food. 2)Initiate steps to end commercialisation of education especially medical education So that quality doctors come out of medical colleges.

0 0 Indian manufacturing suffers a disadvantage of 21% based on account of higher cost of finance & cascaded duty structure. Our ICT industry bases has been eroded over the last few years since India signed the ITA 1 agreement. New products & Indian designs need hand-holding & support if we expect them to resurrect. Least the Government can do is to define DGS&D as a vehicle to promote domestic manufactured & designed products. especially where Technology & capacity exists.

0 0 60 years of rule has only increased and entrenched these fools in our society. You are doing a good job Sir. Please keep it up irrespective of what these fools shout. History will judge you on the basis of your work. 
1 0 We as people are habitual of expecting everything of free. We all want rights, but don't want to shoulder any responsibility. This mentality has its legacy in the times of kings as well as our scriptures. people who work hard are considered fools in our society since ages. We have to change this mentality. People demanding rights and privileges on the basis of their birth and not their skill is the biggest social problem that we face.

Similarly, freight corridors other that eastern and western corridors sud be started.

The present govt isnot making any kind of scheme to improve our agriculture  and irregation system. Thats why the development is completely stopped and labor problem is increasing rappidly.My suggation is to stop giving rice to the BPL person and give the market value of price of rice to that BPL account.Put pressure on Odisha Govt.

0 0 1.Rate contract and suppliers licence should contracted for 11 months only.2.New supplier should be entertained always.3. Timely payment of goods and services leads towards high quality goods and services.4.Rates should be competitive towards price rise.5.Strong vigilance on store of every individual department.6. There should be one procurement head over all department to quote and sanction the requirements.7.Strong transparency at the departmental store level should be strongly followed. 
0 0 India Post has deep reach and well established though not perfectly maintained network/delivery channel. Why India Post cannot/should not partner with the e-commerce companies to come up with an "India Post Logistic Services" wing leveraging or improving upon the existing infrastructure to create an outreach to million more Indians settled in our rural India. It will be an win-win for e-commerce companies to significantly expand their outreach as well as for India Post to reinvent itself.

0 0 All govt department /ministries waste lot of time by doing time consuming procedures in public procurements related tasks mainly to save their skin from vigilance angle . To save precious time and cost it is better to use Procurement Software which should contain Audit feature .The Audit feature can be useful in detecting lapses by the Officers and vendors . 
0 0 Bulk Supply to all Govt Department/Ministry should be directly from Manufacturer /Traders on 25% discount as offered to any whole sale market dealers without any agent/sub agent in commercial transactions . Such a step may be useful in reducing expenditure considerably.

0 1 Dear There, Few ponts; - 1st this dept should not act as enforcement agency rather should work as facilatator. - we have seen that one product is being ordered by the different depts at different rate - 1st task of this role should be developed a homogenous rate cards and specification of the common supplies and services. - if any requirements come from the comman list, dept should be exeempted from few existing processes, which wl expedite the whole procurement processes.

0 0 DGSD should work for supply as well as service contracts as a large number of govt. contracts are service contracts and maximum possibility for malpractices exist in the filed of service contracts. Further, DGSD rates must be applicable to the state govt. departments also to minimize the possibility of malpractices in the various state govt. dealings.

The using of small vehicles will face the problem of the water storage capacity in tanks.

0 0 Sir This is regarding esi social security scheme. Medical education by esic should be handed over to mohfw or state govt. Esic mat set 30 to 50 bed hospital in every 50 to 100 km radius across India.  Chennai KK Nagar esic medical college may be handed over to state Govt and chennai ayanavaram esi hospital may be converted esic model hospital cum occupat disease centre.Esic staff may be shifted from KK Nagar to ayanavaram to overcome staff issues. Esic money also need not b wasted on education. 
0 0 In respect to income tax,The procedure and law should be simplified and genuine and justified, e.i.section 14A deemed income,92 Transfer price applied to local transaction,income of NGO sec.11/12,other deduction u/s. 80 related to NGO, etc. deemed provision have given large discretion to assessing officer, which is the base of corruption or illegal addition of income largely effected to innocent assesse,hence,it should be simplified in favour of assesse and justice to fair taxation system,thanks 
1 0 changing technical parameters and technical qualifications at last stage is nothing more then corruption changing at last stage is basically favouring cronies and sabotaging transparency. In book Gas Wars its author Pranonjoy Guha Thakurda has written very clearly how transparent tendering process is rigged to favour cronies. 
2 0 tendering process needs to be made more transparent. Open tenders are tilted in favour of cronies by changing technical qualification at last stage. If such stuff happens then that tender should be cancelled for public good. This cancelling process should apply to all government procurements. 
0 0 quality control mechanism of products under rate contract is very poor. it requires attention. 
0 0 Purchase manual of state departments and autonomous bodies under government should be updated including the provision to procure materials online through dgs&d website 
1 0 All government departments should be made compulsory to buy only through DGS&D and not from local dealers for all items and if any department is found violation, the concerned department head and officers involved should take  responsiblity  for that  and the entire amount should be collected from them, this will remove corruption.

0 3 Dear Mr. Ravi shankar Parsad, i am having an idea for our govt. & i hope you will discuses the same with Mr. Narendra Modi. & my idea is that we should initiate a campaign under the name GHAR GHAR PHOOL KHILE. Under this campaign every home must have a pink or white flower bail on the outer wall of their home & if any home found without flower bail their should be fine upto 500 rs/- & Also govt should provide this flower bail to Poor families. 
0 0 Dear Mr Ravi Shankar Prasad, Telcos tell us that since the Govt of India did not give them permissions, they are not able to improve the quality of mobile network provided in the Delhi Metro. Students are not able to study while travelling, banking transactions cannot be successfully finished, call drops-be it any operator continues, 3g internet signals are hardly available. Lakhs of passengers travel in the Delhi metro everyday. Could you please look into this case? Regards, Partha Basu 
0 0 भारत के सभी दुकानदारों को जो ऑनलाइन बिलिंग करते हैं DGS&D के सर्वर से इस प्रकार जोड़ा जाना चाहिये कि जब भी वह बिलिंग करता है तो वह रेट और स्थान DGS&D के सर्वर पर संगत सामान के आगे अंकित हो जाय। इस तरह से DGS&D को अपडेट रखा जा सकता है और सही रेट का पता चल सकता है। 
0 0 For better dates it is advised to connect all the billers with DGS&D so that any billing done to any one should entered in the particular material rates. 
0 0 rates of DGS&D should be revised every year and it should be on the basis of current prices e.g. a computer cost for bulk order is Rs.26000/- while DGS&D rate for same is Rs.45000/- it shows huge corruption in rate deciding factors and huge leakage of revenue

0 0 There should be enough transparency in all transactions, approved by the concerned authorities. Should get into e-procurement platform for procurement of commodities to ensure transparency and efficency. 
0 0 Ration materials are theft or saled for cost. To avoid this we Can create one application for this so that it will call the family and they have to press 1 for yes( Bought) and 2 for no. This application must me accessible for the details only when any case filed against it by employee. That too kept secret. So employee dont know who gave complaint won't be able to punish or threat him. Take action if only more than five members didn't buy. Otherwise employee may threat the person. 
0 0 sir reduce human intervention as much as possible for procurement of commodities and you will find less corruption. in this regard make mobile apps. and that will help a lot. 
0 0 sir make paperless office and cash less/cash free India (i.e. minimize cash transaction about 5%) and then it will be easy to combat corruption significantly. 
0 0 sir for transparency of procurement of commodity go online tender/quotation and made payment via ECS ONLY to the seller's account.

0 0 The role DGS&D becomes of prime importance so as to ensure transparent procurement as well as to ensure the quality of the procured goods. The organisation can develop a portal for the same and train its dedicated staff in the direction of using digital techniques for carrying out tasks. A code of standards must be prepared and adhering to it the required goods must be procured.

0 0 Positive potential of revamping and restructuring DGSD role is huge for delivering savings, efficiency, transparency and accountability in the system. Simply put, it is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY. Having twenty plus years of experience in optimising, rationalising and relaying "procurement to pay' policies and processes by leveraging technology and automation (taking help of ERP / Procure to pay systems) across verticals & MNCs-both here in India and inUSA,I will be more than happy to help if required.

0 0 Great initiative as regards optimising quality and procurement of goods and services by the Government. It's a monumental area of opportunity for GOI in terms of 1. cost savings  - 15-20% on an average, 2. improving quality of products / services, 3. automation of procure to pay cycle, 4. reducing ordering, approvals and delivery time 5. plugging in process gaps 6. removing duplicacy, frauds, etc. 6. reducing waste and idle inventory 7. making full procure to pay cycle visible and transparent.

0 0 As per our tradition all the development would along with the farming nature preserving construcit0ns. So we must emcourage the rubber industry for the development works . 
0 0 We must encourage the rubber plantation industry through out the nation. Because we destructing the mountains for the crush stones for laying roads and other construction works. If we continue the same for another 2 or 3 decades we will in problem of mansoon less years . because mountains are major factor for the season rains. so must preserve the mountains and we must use agri products like rubber to fulfill our road and construction works. it will create huge rural employment. please take step 
1 0 For Cheque bounce if someone makes default max 5 times, his/her use of cheque right should be withdrawn. As he/she can not cheat any new person.

I am complainant in Cheque bounce case after 2 years also case has not got stand in court. Instead of paper put email. Everything should be done max thru on-line. Other sectors are making headway but Legal Sector is lacking in big way. JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED.

1 0 DGS&D should be the chief of operating who will command the basic commodities while state Director will be appointed as to check the commodities which is essential for farming like Urea, etc. also give them the power to arrest them and for 1 month no bail will be granted by the any court whether session/district court. 
0 0 Subsidy for PDS supply be made corruption free by closing down Fair Price Ration shops with direct transfer of money to individual bank accounts and buy atleast 72 Rafales or Gripen NGs to boost the diminishing IAF combat aircraft squadrons due to retirement of Mig 21s! JNU & Hyderabad University be saved from traitor anti-nationals by arresting Afzal Guru supporters & Yaqub Memon supporter Rohith Vemula's mates respectively. 
2 0 #DGS&D, #MyGov, Modiji, Before procuring commodities please make necessary provisions to check adulteration in each & every commodity including food materials, cosmetics, medicines etc. If found adulterated ban the commodity & supplier forever & make provisions to give capital punishment. If any officer found corrupt remove them from the service forever. Give suitable directions to change our law. 
0 0 Sir if each and every state or central government department is doing e-procurement then what DGS&D  will do? Since e-procurement takes time so in case of calamity like flood,earthquake,sunami,cyclone DGS&D will be useful for the emergency requirements like Medicine,clothes,food,bleaching powder Make a list of these items as required and DGS&D should make rate contracts on these item only. So that in case of emergency these can be procured without e-tendering system 
0 0 Suggestions-(a)rename DGSD as Common-Housekeeping-Organization(CHO)(b)abolish all general administration in all central ministries and divert their staff to core functions of their ministry(c) all common use items of all ministries to be obtained directly from CHO, online by user officers of all central ministries (d)make all procurement from CPPP created by D/O Expenditure, which is not being used by general sections of various departments only to facilitate financial corruption in procurements

0 0 Dgs&d rate should also take in consideration current market price while orders placed. 
0 0 Sir, to decrease favouritism & corruption, e-procurement is the way forward. The process should involve open tendering/bidding with timeline for supply, penalty for delay & faulty or damaged or below specified standard products. Those found compromising on quality need to be blacklisted immediately with a lag period of atleast three years before they can reapply for review. Centralised procurement with adequate store/ware houses need to be created or can be outsourced to separate logistics arm.

0 0 sir, my humble suggestion to the indian government, state governments and all local governing body's must use indian brand company vehicles only, including president, prime minister, central ministers, chief ministers, state ministers, district collectors, revenue, judiciary, police, army, navy, air force officials and their convoy's. it reflects a huge growth in GDP and indian economy where foreign vehicles import will come down. kindly implement this idea without any propaganda. 
0 0 if you really wants to develop india ask your minister to call all the vendor related to his ministry from all over the world and see their presentation and commit on their proposal. Give target to your minister at least see 100 vendor proposal in one week and at least commit 10 proposal in week. Assign this task to all minister and ask them to air this proposal on News channel. this should be must to air so people can see progress each ministry doing in a day 
0 0 All the District Industries Centre (DIC) should register their production units on DGS&D vendor registration website and mail tenders related to items manufactured by the concerned unit.  so that MSME units will get ready made data for items manufactured by the unit. 
0 0 It should be made mandatory to stop production of Edison bulbs and LED lights to be brought under a system same as for Medicine Price Controller (NDP). 
0 0 Plz take licence from pharma companies directly for INSULIN and CANCER DRUGS and it should be produced by govt pharma companies.It will decrease the price greatly.For example Human Mixtard 50 is produced by Torrent,Licensed from Lilly and Marketed by Abott. Surely these three company will keep huge profit. Secondly for LED lights fix the price with definite profit margin for manufacturer,stockist,retailer, this will reduce the price dramatically.Actually production cost is very low. 
0 0 Dear Prime Minister I request you to supply medicine to the govt hospitals from the govt pharma companies like Karnataka Pharmaceuticals Limited.This will bring transparency in buying medicine as medical supply are not up to the mark and randomly u can collect medicine from different hospital and ask for quality test.U wl find for 500mg Azithromycin only 300mg may be there.It wl avoid corruption cases like Rat Poison Tablets in Chattisgarh.Even KPA medicines need quality control/random check.

1 0 Respected Sir, I fails to find a proper place to share my views, so type here for your kind consideration. 1. I like to suggest that the toys(looks like Arms Gun, bullet etc) should be totally banned in the markets. Because firstly they attracts the children towarda use of weapons and build a ease of having a real gun. Secondly culprit people use them in Robbery etc because of more similarities of these toys with original guns , weapons etc

1 0 1) Faster Quality Control & release of payment to supplier. 2) Even a small vendor from village should be eligible to supply goods, irrespective of quantity, if the quality & price is good. This will boost SME. 3) Creating mobile app if possible for same 4) All coordination between vendor & govt should be online (email etc). 5) In board exam, how teacher doesn't know which students exam paper she is checking, same way, QC shouldn't know who is the supplier which test as he may do some fraud.
