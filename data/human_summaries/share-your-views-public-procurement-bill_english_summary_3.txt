The present system of procurement from L1 through tendering is poor and a major rason for poor quality and delay in work.
Land procurement should not only be for private projects but should also be done for national projects where the governments stake is more than 60%.
It is clear that transparency and competitive pricing is an important aspect of public produrement therefore, the bill should have provision from transparency, availability on the internet and complaint of malpractices.
Supplier Selection should be done on the basis of: 1. Quality Norms Fulfillment, if not there should be penalty/recovery 2. Compliance to Indian safety standards with extra safety margin 3. Matching with fair value of product price, but need not be lowest price unless justifying with reduced costs due to use of new technology/innovative ideas 4. Reward for innovation and/or significant cost reduction without compromising quality 5. Long term validity 6. Revision of acceptance criteria
