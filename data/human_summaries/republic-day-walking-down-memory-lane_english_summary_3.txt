This Republic Day let us remember the sacrifices of our great soldiers who protected us and the farmers who provide us with food.
We are proud that you have been trying to abolish corruption and black money and I believe it has been helping the middle and lower middle class.
Please uplift the ban on Jallikattu and cancel PETA and support the native breeds.
It is also needed to abolish caste based reservation and if needed the reservation should be based on the economic conditions of the people.
