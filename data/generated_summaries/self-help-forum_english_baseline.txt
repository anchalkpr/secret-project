Presently physically disabled people booking tickets are not getting lower berths sometimes.Co passengers doesn't co operate or come forward to swap their seats to help a physically disabled passenger.While booking train tickets there should be an option to allot lower berth automatically by the computer.Even in AC Chair Car those who cannot travel without an escort must be given the next seat.I had bitter experience in this regard.Hope Railway Ministry will consider this suggestion.Thanks.
Prime Minister, is this a form of systematic slow murder of lawabiding learned citizen by PM & Govt.?

Dear Sri Modi Ji, Many talented youngsters across various fields are not able to find a right platform to show their skills.Government must encourage them by giving needed support.
