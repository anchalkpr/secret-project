No one owns the internet so internet should be free for everyone and I don't want any telecom company's to control what we access on the internet!
 We want to access all of the internet, for all of the people, all of the time.
 We want everyone to get access, but to all of the Internet.
 Access to everything on internet and not just select parts of the internet.
