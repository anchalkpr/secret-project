please let the net independent so every site and every category content on the internet is real (yes I just quoted the real definition of net neutrality not the fake one that our govt.
I strongly request the govt.to safe guard net netrually in real safe and reject like Facebook and other organisations which indirectly want to control our net traffic while giving free for few months and later they will charge for any site we browse.
I strongly support net neutrality in the true sense with service providers having no say in guiding the end users or customers through zero rated applications.
True Net neutrality gives me the freedom and means to do whatever I want.
