Build a comprehensive online database of Anti-social elements who are involved in any kind of human trafficking to shame them publicly duly linked with their Aadhaar Card as well as extended families Aadhaar Card's as well.
Appropriate legislations and national / state policy through peoples participation is needed to handle / fighting this problem.
I MY VIEW IF GOVERNMENT PROMOTE CONTEST AMONG NGOS' AND GIVE THEM AWARD, CERTIFICATE , LEGAL SUPPORT TO THE BEST ACHIEVING NGO/SOCIETIES, THEN THERE WILL BE MUCH PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THIS FIELD AND TRAFFICKING CAN BE REDUCE AND PUBLIC AWARENESS CAN DEVELOP.
It will reduce women and child trafficking.
