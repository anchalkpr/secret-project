We do not need telcos dictating what we can view on Internet.
 we dont want telcos controlling what we access on the internet.we want to access all of the internet for all of the people, all of the time and access to everything and not some select parts of the internet.
 We do not want liscenses for watsapp, viber etc.
 That's the real meaning of Net Neutrality and not what telcos or Internet.org defines it.
