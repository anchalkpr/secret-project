In digital india why not make a system of digital street lights which litup automatically depending on the daylight sensors.
 In whole of india there may be thousands of street lights which are not switched off on time and remain on during some hours of the day and sometimes even the whole day.
 Thus causing wastage of electricity and municipal funds which can then be used for other purposes like swacch bharat.I live in Moga punjab and see the lights on in streets during daytime but can't do much.
 More importantly India is set to shell out an additional Rs.
