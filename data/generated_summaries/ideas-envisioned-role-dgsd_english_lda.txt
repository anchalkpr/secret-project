We must encourage the rubber plantation industry through out the nation.
 Since e-procurement takes time so in case of calamity like flood,earthquake,sunami,cyclone DGS&D will be useful for the emergency requirements like Medicine,clothes,food,bleaching powder Make a list of these items as required and DGS&D should make rate contracts on these item only.
 Secondly for LED lights fix the price with definite profit margin for manufacturer,stockist,retailer, this will reduce the price dramatically.Actually production cost is very low.
 Least the Government can do is to define DGS&D as a vehicle to promote domestic manufactured & designed products.
