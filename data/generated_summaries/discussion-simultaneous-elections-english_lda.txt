LS elections can be done separately and  All Rajya Sabha Elections separately with 6mnths gaps Pros: less election time, expenditure control on black money more working days for govt as less days wasted in Model Code of Conduct.
A free and fair election helps to have a better government and its performance.
I do agree that we will save money and minimise corruption.
#SimultaneousElections, #ElectionCommission, #MyGov The holding of simultaneous elections of state assemblies and lok sabha with fixed term is a very good idea and I support the same.
