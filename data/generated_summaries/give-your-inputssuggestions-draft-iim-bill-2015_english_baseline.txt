IN my view IIT, IIM, AIMS & IISc should be their in each state & should be 50-50%supported in setup for center & state govs.It should be part of support co operative federalism system.
If fees for IITs are comparatively quite lower, even IIMs should folllow similar fee structures.
Other than that the student has to pay the EMI of more than 15K for the next 10-12 years,compromising everything due to it.
Government should have a say in fixing the fees of the institutes.
