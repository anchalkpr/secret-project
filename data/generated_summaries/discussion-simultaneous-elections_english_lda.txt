I go with the simultaneous elections for rajyasaba and state legislative assembly.
 In order to achieve the possibility of simultaneous election, extend some assemblies and dissolve some, extend those where remaining tenure is around one to two years and dissolve those where one to two years has been completed.
 It will help dissociate elections from development for some time.
 In case of hung assembly in any state, there can be re-elections after one year.
