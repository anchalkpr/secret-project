Dear PM, for this republic day my humble request with you is merge both Independence day & Republic Day and celebrate only once, thus save the tax payers money.
 This will make every Indian become tax assessee linkage to Aadhaar.
 And we ppl will easily ignore oppositions disturbing reaction.
 The reporters also conveniently mentioned that India has 80% Hindus is the very next line.
