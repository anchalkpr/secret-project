Dear PM Sir, What, I would like to say is it better to have a one single Bank Account Number for each person like we have one PAN Number and Adhare Number for unique people.
Respected sir, In our patriarchal system women employment is disliked.
It is the saddest thing in our country that farmers do not get paid for the effort they put at field for the crops/veggies etc.
Now days human values are decreasing in day by day from all.
