0 0 Friends Keep giving your suggestions to develop Tiruchirappalli into a Smart City at https://mygov.in/group-issue/smart-city-tiruchirappalli/
0 0 Make Aadhaar Card compulsory as much as possible for any transaction whether related to daily commutation, accommodation, billing, purchasing of gadgets or goods etc. Build a comprehensive online database of Anti-social elements who are involved in any kind of human trafficking to shame them publicly duly linked with their Aadhaar Card as well as extended families Aadhaar Card's as well. I hope a we will see a sharp fall in the cases.
0 0 Modenize Indian Police forces, train them like professionals, not cunning sarkari thullas. Tie-up with NYPD, City of London Police, etc. to modernize Indian Police forces. Do audit of all unregulated brothels. Check whether any illegal activities are happening there or not such as underage minors getting abused and forcibly detained, etc. and then take appropriate and swift legal action.
0 0 i am very surprised that our police is not able to stop such a inhuman activity.
0 0 I MY VIEW IF GOVERNMENT PROMOTE CONTEST AMONG NGOS' AND GIVE THEM AWARD, CERTIFICATE , LEGAL SUPPORT TO THE BEST ACHIEVING NGO/SOCIETIES, THEN THERE WILL BE MUCH PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THIS FIELD AND TRAFFICKING CAN BE REDUCE AND PUBLIC AWARENESS CAN DEVELOP.
0 0 Assured food and social security is the key to stop human trafficking. The Human Resource Ministry or a new Union ministry may undertake this responsibility to take up the issue with all the State governments on priority. Appropriate legislations and national / state policy through peoples participation is needed to handle / fighting this problem.
1 0 Please make it mandatory for the police to put the missing people in a centralized portal(Someting Like Khoya Paya).  This is help to trace the origin of the people who are being traficked.
1 0 According to labour law the maximum working hour is 8 hour. where many company working its all employee is 12 hour daily and not even giving them a minimum wages. Please take some action against such companies.
0 0 why all porn site is not get banned? Please ban it completely. It will reduce women and child trafficking. http://bolindiabol.jagran.com/mudda/%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6-%E0%A4%A...
0 0 Sharpen law and order and punishment.
1 0 This problem along with dowry (main) leads to female feticide in Haryana. Police Thana dedicated to women started by HR Govt., beti padhao beti padhao are great initiates. More such initiatives on safety of girls and awareness among society to treat girls equal to boys are needs of hour to curb the trafficking from demand side.
0 0 Mr. PM, I want to thank you for the steps like appraising the selfie with daughter by a village sarpanch in Haryana. These small steps can really help to improve the conditions and status of girls in Haryana. One more problem is the eve teasing with girls and it has to be faced both by girl and her family. If you want to see some example, please visit to any college in Haryana, you will find group of boys at each step towards college passing comments on girls.
0 0 Human trafficking is a concept of economics. It has both demand and supply side. I want to start with Haryana (my state), the state with lowest sex ratio in India. Demand for a wife in Haryana is the biggest factor for girls’ trafficking from other states like Assam, Tripura, Bengal, Odisha, and Bihar. We purchase wives for ourselves. The two-facedness of us is that we purchase girl from other states without any discrimination on caste and GAUTRA, yet we are no. 1 in honour killing.
0 0 There should be non bailable offense for these crimes and highest number of imprisonment. Until unless laws wont be strict, Crime will be happen every single second.
0 0 Teach every one how to deal if you are in a situation like this. there must be a help line number where people can call and infirm in case there is any doubt or possibility of trafficking. even a message service to inform help line will do so that, a victim can also send a message to inform. Missing case of Children and young girls need to post in a govt portal and every police station public should have access to it, which will help to track the victims.
0 0 this is the most sensetive problem  in our country.question first is why the less activity to solve the human trafficking problem in our country.i suggest that in country the human right commission right to take activity on HT problem. on the big issue make in UNO.and contribute the legal SIT to taken on charge under the human rights commission to face them guilty people whose crime to be doing their.20.9 million are trafficked in india.
0 0 This may not be that much easy for us at this point of time. But at one point may be after 50-60 years this will defently happen in Developed countrys. This bio-chip helps us to track each human, which will be helpfull for us to track missing people and even criminals
0 0 How about creation of a bio-micro chip?? This bio-micro ship, is to be  injected into humans. For example, for every new born or for every child below 1 yr are to be given with bio-micro ship, which is not harmful but it always produce some signals. Each bio-chip will have a unique code, which always produces signals thru this signals we can identify the missing persons across the globe.
1 0 Human trafficking can only be reduced with the help of technology as below. 1)	Make aadhaar card mandatory for everybody. 2)	If person is missing, police just need to mark hi aadhaar card for tracking. 3)	Make passage through Railway station/bus stands/airport/taxi/state border only after verifying aadhaar and biometric. It hardy take few seconds to reconcile with missing person’s aadhar card. 4)	Track and destroy the begging mafia abducting children for begging.
1 0 Human Trafficking is Man Made. It thrives just because of the greediness of our society and Main contributor to this cause is the Near and Dear ones of the People Trafficked. Until unless strong laws are implemented on ground with minimal litigation, fixing the accountability and punishing them with harsh punishments, Trafficking will continue to thrive. Views and Pain of the Trafficked people must be considered while bringing in a Law than by considering views of Privileged and Academics.
0 0 Introduce People Relationship Management System which can give multi directinal benifit including human traffcking prventation a.	Family Management chain creation & approval with linking to Social Security b.	Marriage & Child Policy iv.	Spouse rights v.	Adopted Child rights d.	National Population theory based on land & resource availability e.	Birth Registration f.	Family Tree i.	Education Management j.	Financial Management k.	Service Management
0 0 Awareness between children and non educated people that something wrong is happening with them. Need national level toll free number to rescue.
0 0 To prevent human trafficking we should have provide Good skill based education, awareness, developed road-rail , shelter, transparency, innovative technology(IT). People learn more and more developed there own idea and views to change the mankind. Work together with one-another so relationship should be more valuable and healthy.
0 0 I am feeling very sad by seeing the child beggar with there mom asking for money basically in railway station and Train. They are working like a job everyday I don't know whether that money will used for good being or worth. But the issue is very big day by day this type of beggar increases. People facing problems during the journey because one after one coming for asking money. Although not only begging also chance of misleading faced by traveler. So gov kindly take action about it. Jai Hind..
0 0 Human trafficking is a menace which should be taken as a challenge by the government.it is Making India as a HUB for Trafficking in the world. Strict vigilance at all points of Travelling i.e....Railways stations and Bus stands at rural India should be manned by the police or intelligence officials. But the opposite is seen done by those who are posted at the Indian Railways stations the RPF . if the RPF does the 51% of it's duty it could bring a Halt in this menace of INDIA.
1 0 Overseas working is one way of human trafficking. House maids working in Gulf are one of human trafficking. In the name maids mostly are engaged in sex trade.  Even countries that are poorer than us (Egypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and many more) Don’t send any single women abroad or No maids from these countries. These house maids are subjected to sexual abuse, mostly are subjected to conversion of religion, then radicalized. This is a very serious problem for our the security of the country
1 0 1)To Stop Human Trafficking, we have to first make some strict law against, Prostitution and Child beggars. These 2 area are the main reason for human trafficking. Once we control these two area, trafficking will automatically control. 2) Need keep strict eye on Sea and boarder area, through which human trafficking possible for out side of India.
1 0 law enforcement agencies shall get results and they can further investigate on the basis of the clues so received from face detection software. also the family members of the lost person can also be intimated through sms about possible match so that the can verify and confirm further details.
1 0 while designing the web based mobile app the simplicity and speed be main criteria for maximum participation from citizens in uploading the pics of vulnerable persons. the requirement of registration for persons loading pic of vulnerable person should not be there. I on seeing a vulnerable person/ child should able to upload the pic/details of the person/location without much of time, my mobile no. shall act as reference.....matching with missing persons be done by FACE DETECTION SOFTWARE.
1 0 To prevent Human trafficking a web portal similar to Khoya Paya can act as boon. The methodology has to be simple and user friendly. The missing person details are to be uploaded by the family members directly or by law enforcement agencies. FACE DETECTION TECHNOLOGY can be used to find such missing persons. The mobile users all over india be prodded to upload photo of persons whom they think as vulnerable in their city/locality. location & brief physical features be loaded on mobile app.
1 0 I would like to propose very strategic plan to find out child who have been part of the human trafficking and/or missing/lost for whatever reason. I request active response in order to figure out whether the proposal required further enhancement or it's practically feasible enough to implement. Thanks, Ankit Kotak
1 0 Sir, skilled people could not start their own business due to power problem hours long power cuts. So Un interputted power supply is the only solution for progress of the country More business activities more jobs more home and cottage industry will develop.Thamks
1 0 To stop the human traffic, jobs are created on large scale so that every person can feed their family. creat awareness among peoples about frauds who provide a good opportunity of work. Close all prostitution spots.make a system in which all factories and companies uploaded the details of worker on internet.
0 0 Many of the girls r kidnapped only because of prostitution.u r planning to stop pornography ,we knw this is not easily possible task..but u can stop prostitution insake of girls child..
0 0 After making site ...tell people to upload pics with their area where u saw the lost child or a unknown child or a people who u think is lost. With details in that forum ----- afterall people also have something to do Broken msg ....
0 0 Its important to stop this, some thoughts are coming .which I am sharing 1. Why don't we make a online site in which we make two forums ..one is upload pics of people who is lost ..& in another forum upload pics of people who have found by police . Or in 1 forum upload pics of child who begs at every signal.because at d end this is also a business right. 2. After making the. Inform people to use it. Tell police stations to use site on daily basis.upload pics  survey your near area
0 0 this is about improving our justice delivery system. justice delayed is injustice delivered. there is an urgent need to speed up our justice system. here are a few suggestions 1. courts should not accept complaints below certain grade in financial as well criminal terms 2. these disputes could compulsorily go to an arbitration agency set up specially for this purpose. appeals only should go the normal courts. 3. compulsory time limit for disposal of cases by courts.
0 0 My government should open a portal where all the crimes and corruptions are reported through mobile app. At least government would have a data and public opinion on the same. Government will come to know what is wrong and what is right. And Government will get all information of Crime and Corruption at the lowest level.
0 0 How we can stop this act we cannot know. Because there are laws in India which penalizes is some body does wrong (knowingly or unknowingly). But anybody (Politicians, bureaucrat, Public)who so ever knowingly does not perform and do not do anything then there is no law to take care about. Therefore all suggestion will pay nothing if doing non are also not penalized.
0 0 Human trafficking is really slave trade in disguise. Police alone can't solve it because often criminals grease their palms. NGOs do track them and inform police often leading to arrest. Parents and locals should suspect any boys or girls when they are lured jobs far away. Poor and unsuspecting people often fall victims to their greed.
0 0 adoption  is  used  as  a  tool  by  child  traffickers . TRAFFICKER  knows  that  ADOPTING  does  not  arouse  immediate  suspicion , please  see  attachment  pdf  ,  P D F  ATTACHMENT , this  is  spclly  true  in  bengal  where  a  number  of  incidents  have  been  reported  forcing  even  the  SUPREME  COURT  to  take  steps . children  trafficked  from  villages  of  WB  are  found  across  the  country , many  from  these  village  hav  gone  miss
0 0 every prostitute/child bagger has to produce her/his indentity with parent verification with DNA test done, so all noncompliance will give us list of girls who are victim ..government can immediately implement this so resourceful prostitution/baggers market  using human trafiking  will stop
0 0 prevention from human trafficking is we can educate the girls in 10th standard itself regarding various possibility  human trafficking so they can save them self..like by sharing various incident shown by Savdhan India series on TV (boyfriend sale girl to people running prostitution racket )
0 0 most of human trafficking rackets are run by political leaders of various parties as its not possible that such huge network can be managed by political and government support, as we can see only small fishes are being punished in almost all cases but police never arrest the mastermind...
0 0 To eradicate it, there is need of employment opportunity in village level, so that nobody will be attracted to become rich overnight and nobody trafficked. An incident happened in Odisha recently. We (MEA, DM and indian high commission) care struggling to release a group of 11persons from physical, mental torture, harassment of a company of Malaysia who were trafficked to there. At the same time, another 8 people goes there 10 days back and facing same torture from another company knowing facts.
0 0 New portal shall be introduced to children below 18 years to have active participation of their views with the government in any forms.This will improve the intellectual skills and motivate the parents to involve and participate their children in these forums. Also, children should have rights to post their comments on child labours if they happen to see anywhere.  Nowadays children are more talented than youth making several achievements in small ages.
0 0 to stop human trafficking, there should be annual or biennial practice where the children below 18 register themselves as students or something, to gazetted officers.any child failing to do so should be investigated by local police.this data shall be centrally audited to avoid local corruption.this might save the minorsand force the parents to educate them.their should be real time data sharing with nations.i.d of kidnapped people should reach to foreign coast guards, border patrols, for tracing
0 0 Police always keep record of these beggars., How??? Well its a basic reality becoz policemen takes small bribes from them on daily basis otherwise they r not allowed to beg.. """AND MOST IMPORTANTLY""" ((EVERY BEGGAR AREA IS FIXED)) SO THEY BASICALLY KNOW THE AREA FROM IN & OUT... IF EVEN 1% OF POLICE TAKE HELP OF BEGGARS BY INCENTIVISING THEM..CHILD TRAFFICKING CAN BE STOPPED WITH SURETY..
0 0 The BEST WAY TO FIGHT IT IS BY ENGAGING ""BEGGARS"" THEMSELVES. ITS OLD SAYING THAT ""LOHA LOHE KO KAATKA H"".. A PARTICULAR AREA BEGGAR WILL DEFINITELY KNOW THAT IF ANY CHILD IS KIDNAPPED, he/she will first be made to beg or will be kept at a place where only a beggar sleeps.. QUES IS???  ##"""HOW TO TAKE HELP OF THESE BEGGARS""##???? ANS: THESE BEGGARS CAN BE LURED WITH CASH REWARDS,,PETTY AMTS BY POLICE DEPTT.. POLICE ALWAYS KEEP RECORD OF THESE BEGGARS..
0 0 pgportal ,  ministry  of  women  and  child  development , REFER  :  DOWCD/E/2015/00292 , reference  :  D O W C D  /  E  /  2 0 1 5  /  0 0 2 9 1  , DOWCD / E / 2015 / 00293 , DOWCD/E/2015/00294 , please  look  into  these  complaints
0 0 SIR I HAVE SOME VIEWS IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF RESERVATION IN GOVERNMENT JOBS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES. SIR NOW SOME BACK WARD CASTS GETTING RESERVATION FOR ALL KINDS OF GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES. BUT SIR SOME FINANCIALLY BETTER PERSONS GETTING IT NOW.BUT IN FACT 40 PERCENTAGE OF UPPER CAST PEOPLE',THEY ARE ON VERY BACK IN FINANCIAL SITUATION HAVEN'T GET ANY RESERVATION IN GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES.IN THIS OCCASION SIR PLEASE MAKE A FINANCIAL RESERVATION FOR UPPER CAST FINANCIALLY BACK.
0 0 At Grass root level people have to be educated and awareness has to be created among them also regarding the menace of human trafficking as many poor illiterate people are involved in some or other way in the business out of poverty, compulsions and lack of awareness. So, at that level people needs to sensitized through  skits, plays and short dramas the menace of human trafficking and some of them may even be used as informers to police for information on the gangs working in the business.
0 0 India !....never b surprised if some day it will cum to limelight tat for hefty 3rd grade money earning resource some unscrupulous politicians or police or beaurocrates have strong nexus wit d typical anti-socials, traffickers, terrorists etc. IF HUMAN  OR  ANY  OTHER  KIND  OF  TRAFFICKING  HAS  TO  B  SERIOUSLY  STOPPED  FOREVER  THEN  CLEAN  AND REFORMED  GOVT.  IS  REQUIRED  AND  CORRUPT,  ANTI-NATIONAL  POLITICIANS,  POLICE  AND BEAUROCRATES  MUST B   DWARFED AT  ANY  COST !!
1 0 Create smart police stations and Make Aadhaar compulsory for everyone, Update our national database server with each and every citizen's profile and supply the data to the smart police stations. seal Indian borders with tight security to stop teenagers being exported to arab nations for prostitution. Every hospital in India should be monitored, transplant surgeries should be cross checked thoroughly with details of donors and receptors case file.
0 0 Please update our law to stop the Human Trafficking
1 0 Ban prostitution in India completely and Strictly... Half of the problem will get solve dramatically. If possible ban all the free porn websites. Secondly make the registration mandatory for servants;Home service staff with aadhar no, permanent address proof, bank account details,PAN card no. & birth certificate. Agents and companies must get registered and defaulters must be prosecucated with at least 30 years in jail.
1 0 Human Trafficking = Terrorism. When nations all over the world especially the Countries with so called Veto Power do not get serious about the sanctity of human life than we can not hope for better future. Human Traffickers are Terrorist & they should tried for capital punishment. Strong Laws needed for all Trafficking related Cases(Rapes, Slavery, Prostitution, Drugs etc). No Exception. We can not let them to take our liberty. Human Life is priceless not to be sold. Once gone, can't come back.
1 0 hello sir my self Aman and doing research on Human Trafficking from Banaras Hindu University Varanasi and i just want to say one thing that this HT could not be stop until and unless academicians do something for this because at present demand and supply is going on in the market, more the demand more will be supply and one of the most important thing is that demand is mostly comes from youth for sex exploitation business families for the laboures etc. you can read my views in attached file.
0 0 Sir , Main issue is rehalibtation of the poor..like  in cities, we need domestic help , whom we can send to schoool and take care ..  like i can take one boy or girl  with me to dubai and take care of the same .. we dont have easy and accountable way to do this , pl have soem system with embassy , like i  can adopt a child via  embassy and help giving a good life  to one country man to start with , ogvt to link NRI to develop prog  to control cost  like traing in foreigh .. any govt sponsored
0 0 A Whats app number for every state /Police station/Any other body who can track through GPS   needs to be created as well as a helpline number on which any person who have slightest of doubt that anyone is being  trafficked He/she can reach the Police or dial that number share in the information so that action can be taken
1 0 1. Make a web site where we can upload snaps of beggars (child used in trafficking). 2. Microwave imaging to look inside large truck near Toll Plaza and National Highway. To prevent human trafficking. 3. Dual tracking and monitoring at road and Highways from two different agencies e.g. Army and NIA. 4. Add Prevention of Human Trafficking in Corporate Social Reform, and allow/support NGOs to work in these field.
1 0 Most of Human Trafficking Cases are classified into three category 1. Employment at Low Wage 2. Taking their Biological Organ like Kidney, Liver etc by Five Star Hospitals and giving money for this. 3. Sexual Abuse For first two points generally men/boy trafficked and last point is reason of girl to be trafficked. U just need to crack nexus boldly and once you start this on serious note. Everything will be fall in place.Bring a strong legislation for this first,Then Implement it.
0 0 The laws should be draconian enough and it should NOT differentiate between Poor and Rich and people have absolutely no faith in judiciary now until draconian measures are taken. It should be on lines of POCSA so that whether it is a Big media house pimp or NGO they should be incarcerated for long for these horrendous crimes. It should not happen that a Teesta,gets bail on phone, a Salman gets bail for murder, a Tejpal,gets bail for rape while Poor Colonel Purohit is incarcerated
0 0 are not handed over to their relatives for two three days, and many times the organs are found removed. A SIT enquiry needs to be set to break this nexus of Media-NGO-Child traffickers-Organ Traders
0 0 When ABP=Anand Bazaar Patrika is involved in human trafficking, and mostly these poor tribal women and girls are being sexually exploited,including the so called "Top media seculars". Big Hospitals Corporate chains, which have these media nazis in their payrolls are deliberately allowing Poor to die, or are being killed to harvest their organs. The big MNC hospitals specially are indulging in this full time, including so called "Top Notch media advertised", even people who die
0 0 Hon'able Prime Minister The Organ Trafficking and Child Trafficking is a big business not of small time players BUT BIG so called Respectable people in the media and NGOs. I have been working in premier MNCs in India and abroad as an Engineer, and I have seen the so called NGOs (one of them by a ex NAC member and a media house based in Kolkatta the ABP, Anand Bazar Patrika which is placing poor tribals from Jharkhand and openly criminal Bangladeshi criminals as support services
0 0 such children as mentioned above provide a hot bed for traffickers.A special government cell must be created to take care of such children ,in every city,to take care of their food and education.
0 0 We come accross large numbers of children begging on the streets and even sometimes found feeding themselves from the thrown and rotten food in the heaps of garbage. I often find little girls and boys in the vicinity of temples , one place is the lane of Kalibari in Mutthiganj Allahabad. They present a very dismal and painful sight. and the indifference of the people visiting such places makes one ashamed of being called a civilised person with a sense of social responsibility.
0 0 There r three physical need 1 food 2 excretions 3 Sex. A person in extreme need of any of these three need, can go down at any level.Its continuing since ages in every country, society & community. Strictest rule,humiliation or execution of punishment will not cure it. Even Legalising the prostitution will not solve. Few country has done this but it still exists. Only Solution lies with in ourselves thru proper enlightenment & sex education.So get into the route of the problem is imp.
0 0 It is mainly because of the taboo we have in the system. Even govt officials are afraid to talk about it when PM and Ministers don't even touch on the topic if forceful prostitution on young children. Govt should legalise prostitution, make sure everyone enjoys equal rights and protection(even prostitutes and their children). And punish people involving in human traficking.
0 0 It is mainly because of the taboo we have in the system. Even govt officials are afraid to talk about it when PM and Ministers don't even touch on the topic if forceful prostitution on young children. Prostitution has to be regularised and govt should give limited permissions and have a track on people involved in it. Unauthorised forms must be severely curbed and laws similar to anti-black money law have to be created and passed specially focusing on the problem.
0 0 Only aggressive spying in such areas would able to stop human trafficking .Need feedbacks from very poor communities.obviously its not e savvy.so need modules in investigative agencies to report such.For should be allowed in 2 days by emode.Guilty estate should be seized.He sshould be punished.Sir terrorism is not the single thing on which intelligence required .And after being PM n having everything at u r disposal your intelligence system is corrupt or some weak link.
0 0 How can it exist at large without the knowledge of top notch officials or ministers? Redeem the system first.
0 0 Fill the loopholes in education system and generate jobs, if people are able to earn well, nobody would resort to unfair means.
0 0 Dear PM We notice everyday that there are murders by firearms at various corners of India. Where from are these unauthorized weapons sourced & why these elements are protected by political parties? Cant we stop/minimize this menace for a better standard? Can’t we make a law to curb this internal terrorism with iron hands? Are we that docile and ineffective? Do you want we, the normal people, take law in our hand and counter this menace? Please act NOW to stop India from becoming a lawless land
0 0 its also the duty of public to be aware of such incidents n perform their duties by infoming the police n must help to stop such kinds of this
0 0 People involved in human trafficking should be severely punished.every one should inform police if they know any child who is being victim of this.more orphanages should be built were government & NGOs should look after these children also suffered(victims) children should get scholarships for education.I am specifically keeping my view on topic of child trafficking.
0 0 the human trafficking is rampant because the pimps can get the customers via the internet for example: http://delhi.craigslist.co.in/search/bts and many more so i suggest that the special police officers appointed under immoral traffic prevention act be trained in the cyber crime or these officers be assisted by trained individuals in cyber crime....
1 0 modi sir, apne government ko to ek nayi revolution de di hai, but sir ham public ko kab milegi sir, m aabi Bangalore me hu or aaj mera reservation tha jisme meri reservation ki waiting list 6 thi,but mai jab station pe phucha to meri waiting 6 hi thi or mera tickit cancel ho gya tha, ab mene socha ki mai yhi reservation counter se waiting tickit le lu to mai kisi tarah ja sakta hu, or phir jab mai reservation counter phucha to wha bhot lambi line lagi hui thi logo ki,....
0 0 Orphans are vulnerable to become anti social elements. I suggest government take care of them during their childhood, educate them. Part of them can be inducted into armed forces  and for policing.
1 0 Today the goal of our life has become mere materialistic gains. The technology advancement has been misused by few selfish persons to misguide the common public as if we are going to live in this world for ever. In this process the normal human relationships like husband-wife, father-son, teacher-student, wife-mother-in-law and so on are damaged. The significance of these relations should be well understood. Everything should be based on "Give & Take" policy. Proper agreement should be signed.
0 0 Rescued Children should be given to Kailash satyarthi kind of social workers. Child support organizations should be supported and children should be made inspired and motivated to work against bad practices in country like human trafficking. Buddha teachings important here too.
0 0 Children are being considered best for employment by some business section. Because children have flexible mindset, innocence, helpful nature they are the best preference to some people. Why should parents give birth to children when they cant look after them and let others play with children's future. Make a law, that a child labor is equal to being child adopted and should be given share of property of owner. This may be joke or not a joke.
0 0 Unfortunately, Criminals are being made in this society rather than criminal making himself. There are parents in poor families who mistreat and abuse their own children having no compassion. Some are being sent away to unknown places under pretext of employment. This is no humanity. Children should not be seen as sources of income. parents have right to give birth to children if they cannot love, care for children enough
0 0 Human trafficking is a shame on contry like ours where great traditions and religions have born. It is equivalent to animal treatment of human beings. In big country like ours, it has become great difficulty for authorities to restrict this since Independence. There should be domestic intelligence agencies working on this. agents should be given task of finding out roots of this evil, and in which region. It is unfortunate that own parents mistreat and abuse their children in some cases.
0 0 please make statistics division improve its statistics efficiency and depth, wide variety of issues (KEY NATIONAL INDICATORS OF WELL-BEING of different age groups) just like USA presents its children's well being information in http://www.childstats.gov And use this to make plans to make programmes to alleviate problems. Well informed goverment is the most confident way of governance. The accurate information on different issues and living conditions of people is so important
0 0 Human trafficking is very bad and dangerous act in the world. To avoid this atitude in people,govt.should punish culprits in these cases with severepunishment like LIFE SENTENCe and HANGING.
1 0 There should be a central data of people going missing....Following step should be implemented 1- Create a dedicated phone line to register the missing people via phone or online both 2- Connect this information to their local police whether the case solved or not 3- Revisitng this data should be region by region by high profile officers. 4- Accountability and  timely Case solving should be there... Note -: Most of the time Police is always aware of such miscreants but they dont act
0 0 Awarness through Education is one of the most important thing. BUT we all know that it will take at least 20 years to apply that plan. Now the best armor against it is FEAR. Give the worst possible punishment to the monster those are involved in Human Trafficking and Rape even if they are fakely prestigious person of our society and even if they sit next to you in parliament
0 0 The victim centric approach should change.education that bring awareness can only prevent tribal people from vulnerability either human trafficking or becoming maoist.
0 0 We can control human  trafficking  by using technical  method we can use the image of eye same as the adharra card formation. Suppose a child born in delhi at the time of born we take the image of eye.. by which we get the detail of child. Now we scatter waves over the delhi by which we get detail  of that child for that we make a set which correlate  both waves and eye image. If the chid move out side the delhi we get the detail. Sir it can work
0 0 aadhar card drive is over.now we need to take DNA sample and attach it to aadhar(as a biometric code).every police station/hospital should be equipped with DNA test codification unit.so that his family members can be found .missing children can also be matched with parents and siblings.
0 0 in this case of human trafficking we should need strict our rules and regulations then only we can control, and the drug and illegal works must and should punishment little larger then it's changes we can see what is going on this line of
0 0 Respected Group members what we are following all the steps are  good ,but some of the should need to change because this 21 st century and this rules and regulations  20th century we much and should need to look each and every law review and need to modify some the thing in orientation,we much go through 21 century ,we need study mostly most peace full country like France and united kingdom and European union ,they are the one now leading world and America also having some the laws well
1 0 Government should rehabilitate the sex workers and ensure the eradication of the prostitution.by strict decisions and no new girl should enter in prostitution. Jai hind
0 0 One thing we can do is goverment can provide the labour distribution management system any body want a labour for various works can get from these kind of  goverment labour unit as per their skill and for the goverment works their is noo need to give contract to contractor if govermeng have labour then use their own we have engineering department which can guide them as per their skill and knowledge if anybody found with a labour without certified from goverment will be punished

1 0 one of the most important problem in india. poor children are most vulnerable to trafficking because of the lack of basic facilities due to which they come in the hands of traffickers. even our police is not able to protect them,the biggest reason is corruption moreover they arrange the children .continuous surveillance should be there in slum regions andthis should be taken care by block development officer.special society should be formed to have counselling of victims &if possible compensate

1 0 There is just one way of controlling human trafficking or any other crime. Quick investigation & certainty of punishment. It is hardly possible in India. Criminals with money power & right connection delay the justice delivery system to eternity & proclaim that they are innocent till found guilty. We need police, administrative & judicial reform for faster punishment of criminals. This will be a deterrent against any crime. Time is running out. Let us act fast. Existing system is a failure.
2 0 Respected Sir, Thanks for good work. I want to bring your attention to an increasing horror of beggars in India.  It is a horrible chain starting from kidnapping children, making them disabled and forcing them to beg. Many sedated infants can be seen carried by beggars to gain sympathy. Something should be done to rescue these children and reunite them with their families. DNA matching between parents who lost their kids and  children rescued can be done to help reunion. Plz do needful.

1 1 Train punctuality need to be focused more as most of the train in Danapur division runs behind the schedule.However there is a on line complaint facilities arranged but still there is no improvement,it looks there is lack of strict disciplinary action which is required in railways.
1 1 In Patna Jn Platform Nos 10 is fully occupied by unauthorized person specially in night time.It has become a night sleeping yard.Whole night fan and light getting used by unwanted persons. Railways premises should be strictly  controlled by the railways police force and staff.
0 1 In Patna railways yard there is no security as there are so many unwanted peoples walk into the yard and they take bath/wash their cloth whole days no one is their to check them. RPF is busy in collecting fund from other social anti elements.In this ways railways resources are wasted like any things.Yard should be secured so that no one unauthorized person inter in this area.
1 1 1.Railways officers are not making their attendance by electronic machine provided for attendance specially in Bihar Railways Division offices. 2.Railways officers when they go on tour they take their subordinate as a comfort tools which is not required,hence system should made in place to stop such malpractices.
1 1 In Indian Railways there are departmental examination conducted internally by which all junior level get promoted by their departmental officers recommendation.It is understand that there are lot of fraud cases are happening and not deserving candidate get promoted by obliging the officers,hence these examination should be conducted by third party so that fair dealing and justice for all given.
0 1 There are so many Bihar govt mail id for state govt but no one response to the problems when we write to them.Even we write to CM Bihar for any suggestion there is a auto reply by the deputy secretory .But action taken is not intimated to us ,hence we are in dark for the action taken or not.Even we are not sure that whether our suggestion has reached to CM or not.Hence there should be system in place for to and fro communication between citizen so that citizens get encouraged and participate .
1 1 MP of my area is not visiting to village and he is also not participating with farmers problems neither he is interested to know the difficulties of villagers in general as well as related to irrigation issue.My MP is shri Ram kripal Yadav from PATNA rural also We are not able to get his mail id/cell ns and availability in Patna so that we can approach and apprise him about our problems.Our village is -GOPALPUR under Masaurhi Prakhand in Patna District.His schedule should be provided on net.
0 1 PRIMARLY THIS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PARENTS AND TEACHERS TO EDUCATE THEIR CHILDREN LIKE OTHER GIRLS/WOMENS ARE OUR SISTERS.EVERY PARENT MUST PROMISES THAT THEY GIVING FINANCIAL SUPPORT BELOW THEY REQUIRED.FOR EXAMPLE I NEED 1 RUPEE TO ENJOY BUT MY PARENT IS TO GIVE 50 PAISE .THEN HOW I ENJOYED MORE.SECONDARY ,WHY THE INDIAN CENSOR BOARD HAD GIVEN PERMISSION TO SOME MOVIES WITH HIGH EXPOSING OF ACTRESSS.WHY THEY GIVE PERMISSION TO SOME NEWS PAPERS,BOOKS HAS PRINTED HIGH EXPOSING OF LADY PHOTO
0 0 Also the foreign supported NGOs like "DFN" of ex-NAC member and a known CIA agent and rabble rouser with is still untouched. Still the mass murder of Poor Uttrakhandi protesters shot and women raped including underage girls by SP goons is unpunished. 58 Indians were burned alive in Godhra and under somebody's order. A sold out judge Ganguly AND a politician put it on Beedi, a abuse on those killed. Why those neanderthels are still unpuinished for abusing the dead.How can we expect justice then
0 0 While all so called "secualar' traitors talk about Gujarat all are silent on a bigger genocide in nandigram. Why is Govt not investigating? Lot of bigwigs in media also are part of bigger ring. I would suggest a creation of Volunteer National Guard of atleast 2 crore whereby Govt ONLY pays for training and weapons if need be. The training can be on weekends 4 days per month. Retired Army and Police officers can be used for this also. It will create a buffer and volunteers can't be bribed
0 0 PLEASE MAKE A SPECIAL TEAM WITH CID,POLICE AND NGO..INSPECT THE AGENCY THAT HIRE HUMAN RESOURCES CONSULTANCY  OR OTHER AGENCY, NGO, ASHRAM ETC.
1 0 Dear sir, here I am talking about the matter of kashmiri pandit's . I just want to know that , Is politics is above then nation. Why we are unable to make a strong rule. why the fundamental rights are not same for every Indian. we need amendment in 370 ?
0 0 sir first of all ban human trafficking of all means and form a another administration for child labour criminal cases
0 0 The British are worried that it takes on average 154 days (or just over 5 months) from an offence to sentence in their Criminal Justice System and have initiated a series of reforms. and we are using the same system as theirs!!!
0 0 Swift, fair and efficient delivery of justice is required to deter people from crime. Law Minister DV Sadananda Gowda suggested amending certain Acts to dispose of petty offences and talked of making mandatory pre-trial conferences under which both defence and prosecution lawyers will be asked to file necessary statements and evidence without any delay to ensure speedy trial of the case. Pious sentiments apart, comprehensive reforms need to be carried out in a time bound schedule.
0 0 There should be very severe actions to be taken against the people as the law in Arab countries. The people  who runs the trafficking and who makes many girls as a part of it should be severely punished,after seeing the punishment no one should ever dare to do such things then this gets stops to gretaer extent....
0 0 In some state trafficking is direct linked with lower sex ratio and early child marriage we need to curb it then form a record of lost children and women and each SO of police station is direct responsible to answer we can link duties of human rights office and NGOs.
0 0 There should be stringent punishment of hefty fine and jail atleast for min 5 years of those caught in Human Trafficking. After Nepal & North Bihar earth quake, we should be strict vigil if any suspicious girls found with stranger at Bus/Railway station. All girls at village should be given basic education (RTE) and the gram-panchayate may encourage education.
0 0 LAW COMMISSION OF INDIA Report No. 245 submitted in July 2014 deals with Arrears and Backlog and Creating Additional Judicial manpower. The Commission sought to highlight an urgent need to fix rational, non-mandatory time frames for different types of cases, and use such time frames as a basis for setting judge performance standards, litigant expectations, and making more robust policy recommendations for the judiciary.
0 0 LAW COMMISSION OF INDIA Report No.239 Submitted to the Supreme Court of India in W P (C) NO. 341/2004, Virender Kumar Ohri Vs. Union of India & Others in March  2012 deals with Expeditious Investigation and Trial of Criminal Cases Against Influential Public Personalities.
0 0 Govt. of India, Ministry of Home Affairs constituted the Committee on reforms of Criminal Justice System to make a comprehensive examination of all the functionaries of the Criminal Justice System, the fundamental principles and the relevant laws.  The Committee, having given its utmost consideration to the grave problems facing the country made its recommendations in its final report 12 years ago in March 2003. 158 specific recommendations were made.
0 0 The solution to most problems lies in reform of JUSTICE SYSTEM, which has become ineffective. A large number of guilty go unpunished in a large number of cases; the system takes years to bring the guilty to justice; and has ceased to deter criminals.  Crime is increasing rapidly everyday and types of crimes are proliferating. Several reports on REFORMS are gathering dust in the Archives of the Government. A time-bound action plan should be made and implemented with alacrity.
0 0 Increase basic education about human trafficking in school curriculum, highlight verification/precaution measures, engage in creative opportunities, If in emergency distress, create alternative system instead of pressurizing local authorities. Above all, there should be increase in informal communication and expression between ordinary citizens.
0 0 Can we ban these websites and take action against these people... the worst part is they are influential people and they can even take away your life... so without protection I am fighting I hope govt of India will support me
0 0 Dear Sir, I am a simple middle class family person who is more keen in keeping the society neat and clean recently while surfing a website I saw that there are people who are involve in doing illegal activities as a responsible citizen I am not liking this and I need you to stop this please find below is the proof of that I hope MHA will surely act on this http://hyderabad.locanto.in/ID_302853839/Young-Indian-airhostess.html
0 0 SIR SOME EMPLOYEES FROM RUBBER WOOD INDIA OR INDIA WOOD AT KOTTAYAM IN KERALA IS A COMPANY BY RUBBER BOARD.NOW FACING A MAJER SITUATION OF ANTY HUMAN ATTACK BY NOT ALLOWING THEM TO DO THE WORK IN THE COMPANY.TODAY WORLDS WORKING AND EMPLOYMENT DAY THEY HAVENT GET JOB FOR THEIR FUTURE LIFE.300 EMPLOYEES FACING A BAD SITUATION OF THEIR ENTERE LIFE.KINDLY MAKE A STEP TO GIVE THEM TO DO THEIR WORK AND TO MAKE A LIFE WITH THEIR FAMILY IN THIS COUNTRY.RUBBERBOARD AND MINISTRY COMMERCE DontDO
1 0 The best definition for Governance : Sacrifice. Yes, only those who love to sacrifice their 'SELF' must be involved in governance at every level. But in recent times we find politicians who are greedy for positions, hungry for public money, want to establish the 'SELF', want to take advantage of system to satisfy their desires and make them BIG. How can someone work for poor people, better society benefit with so much biased minds as these. This is the reason India is backward than China.
1 0 I really feel bad when i found small chidren begging on the signals across all the cities in India. I Wish i could do something for those children. We are not sure if this is human trafficking or the parents force their own children to begg and earn money. If we could have strict action plan against such parents. We can have one anatha ashram at main cities in india and police will be sending the children to Anatha ashram if found.
1 0 Human trafficking is a curse of our society. Poor parents often sell their children for child labor or to brothel. Police don't work without bribe, so NGOs can directly report to government about this abuse. We need a sensitive Police and concerned citizens to stop this menace.
0 0 there should be strong police reforms and in suspected areas there should be detective approach towards it  there should be social awareness....
0 0 Human trafficking for children,us district k sabhi government,private schools me bachhon ki strenth local adminstration ko dena jaroori ho or school na jane wale bachhon k strength ka har 6mahine pr survey ho.jissey real Number or children ka ptaa chalega or iskey alawa agar koi vyakti human trafficking me pkda jataa hai to life impresenment ki saza ho or heavy fine lagat jaye,logo ko,bachhon ko school me he human trafficking ki jankari di jaye or unhe aram surakhsha k gun sikhaye jye
1 0 then action should be taken against them, with heavy fines.. By doing this, no. of kids going missing will drop down as these kids ultimately are the one who are forced either into prostitution (specially girls) or begging. through CCTV,no.of crimes as well as   children missing will come down. 1) achieving start with believing 2) to improve is to change, to aim for perfection is to change. 3) in decision can be your worst mistake. 4) one should focus on making things better, not bitter
1 0 This is regarding children who are going missing now a days. CCTV installation should be made mandatory for all the shop owners, schools, hotels, buildings, etc. Notice should be given to all the above for not allowing any (specially kids) begging in front of their shops/hotels etc. If found, the matter should be reported to the near by police station immediately, so immediate action can be taken against those who has forced these kids to beg/work road. If no heed is taken by the shop owners,
1 0 I have an idea to control the Rape Crime.. Please go through the page.. i have tried to explain.. http://socialarmyindia.blogspot.in/
0 0 There are many kids on street begging for money. If we give them food their so called mothers probably ladies who stolen those kids from their natural homes. Snatch what ever we give them food/ money. They are on squares where traffic police is deployed , they are in front of 5 start hotels where all rich and famous go. But no body raised a voice. As a common person I always fear of some counter attack on me if I report to any helpline. Our system should protect us.
0 0 Namaste everyone! Nowadays as we all know certain specific crimes (you know the crimes I m talking about- nirbhaya case and trafficking and more like that) are increasing day by day.. It is usually observed that criminals involved are petty job holders who are hand to mouth and doesn't even have a shelter sometimes.. for them living in a prison is no more a big deal where they get minimum two times meal and a shelter to live and that too when they are caught. Since they are tending to commit..
0 0 Such crime depict that they are not psychologically human so they should not be even treated like human. Certain concentration camps (hitler ones) should be made and given inhuman treatments their and for criminal like that in nirbhaya case should never be hanged but should be sent to gas chambers (hitler ones) . There is no need to have feeling of pity on them. Special cells (concentration camps) have to be mad for them.
0 0 The law for Human Trafficking and women's safety should be very prioritized in the country. There has to be strict rules to overcome this heinous crime. It is the government who can make such laws to secure the each and every citizens. Employment, Growth and security must be the prime concern of BJP.
1 0 In my personal view, government can not change everything. The human trafficking issues will be dealt only by considering all the aspect such as strict law passed by Parliament, law enforcing honest government officials, vigil and society caring common man and above all poverty alleviation. Yes, BJP government has taken many decent steps and thing will be changed very soon. We must follow PM's advices and work together for a brighter future. Good time will come soon. Let us work together.
0 0 call Maharashtra police officer wasant dhoble . good cob but under estimated by gov and some human right activist hungry for media attention .
0 0 This is entirely an administrative issue. Nothing to do with the public opinion. Ask something new. Don't ask us about how to implement law and order.
1 0 I believe that there are enough laws against human trafficking, but their implementation is not done properly most probably due to the attitude of police. I don't think that it is difficult is govt. takes active initiatives for stopping these activities. In some regions there are comparatively more cases of child kidnapping(like haridwar), and at the same time, in those regions disabled child beggars are also comparatively more. Such kind of patterns can be identified to stop trafficking easily
1 0 In my opinion, there should be a website which provide facility for online complain and tracking of its status without disclosing the name of the complainant (through login by one time password on mobile) against the persons engaged in human trafficking without visiting police stations. Visiting police stations is a headache as we know many times police does not co-operate with the complainant, due to which many people even knows such events of human trafficking do not report it to police.
1 0 If we can stop beggars on road specially child beggar it may reduce this problem
0 0 I am not sure if this is the right place to share this or if it is better to create a group called "Safe India" within this forum. I believe that the safety of women and children of India and their protection against kidnapping, abuse and such hideous crimes is the need of the hour. These crimes should be battled by leveraging today's technology and the creative minds of fellow citizens. I believe that this social reform could be achieved by creating awareness and with the help of digitization.
1 0 WE HAVE TO FIGHT AGAINST THIS.WE HAVE TO CREATE AWARENESS ABOUT THIS TO CHILDREN AND THE WOMEN.A HELPLINE SHOULD ALSO BE STARTED TO HELP THOSE CHILDREN AND WOMEN WHO ARE CAPTURED IN THIS VICIOUS CIRCLE.
1 0 Human trafficking is a crime against humanity and society. It should be tammed by making aware of people. Naxalism , crimes are spread through human trafficked people. Also VESHYAVRITY is done through human trafficked girl children. Education should be strengthen to stop these crime. Policing must be corruption free. Corrupt police encourage anti social and criminals. Check border of Pakistan, Bangladesh strictly.
0 0 sir legalise escort services and give sex workers their basic citizen rights because women who once come in this trade even if want to give some info are harassed by police and society, moreover seal the borders of nepal and bangladesh properly,extra vigilance must be taken for tribal girls or children of bpl families as police didnt file fir, the rackets of organ donation must be dealt strongly
1 0 Human trafficking under the guise of orphanages and old age homes should also be verified. There are reports that many such institutions work for religious conversions getting money from overseas. There was a report in 1970s, while I was a student, that a charity organisation "rescued" a man on the streets but he was converted before his death thereby denying his right to die believing in his own religion. Even now many at prayer meetings say that they rescued a person by converting him/her.
1 0 Sir this is cruel, immoral, antisocial activities this should be stooped by heavy punishments. All people/labors  should be identified and registered through Govt. Agencies. we have to informed to Govt. if we have any information
0 0 Not just government,being a girl i suggest all other girls to be conscious when they are going out. 1.While boarding into cab/bus/any other transport,with out any hesitation take a snap of auto number and driver and send that to home/friends.so that if something happens it will be easy to trace culprit. 2.Avoid late night pubs. i think 1st suggestion will help you a lot than any other thing.
0 0 emergency apps should be made so that people can use them when needed the most. the app must be FREE and should have features of contacting the police and family members in less time
0 0 N CHATTISGARH THERE IS NO LAB FOR TESTING SWINE FLU H1NI VIRUS AND NO KITS , NO MEDICINES , NO TAMMY FLU TABLETS, PATIENTS WILL DIE DUE TO LACK OF RESOURCES. WAKE UP CALL FOR CENTRAL GOV. HEALTH MINISTRY AND C.G GOVT. HEALTH MINISTRY.
0 0 N CHATTISGARH THERE IS NO LAB FOR TESTING SWINE FLU H1NI VIRUS AND NO KITS , NO MEDICINES , NO TAMMY FLU TABLETS, PATIENTS WILL DIE DUE TO LACK OF RESOURCES. WAKE UP CALL FOR CENTRAL GOV. HEALTH MINISTRY AND C.G GOVT. HEALTH MINISTRY.
0 0 There must stern laws for human traffickers and Non government organizations/individuals working against  human trafficking should be encourage through monetary help.
1 0 we should have hidden cameras at those area which are said to be area of crimes to get information about that. Being a citizen of india we can help our country's citizen in a best possible way.
0 1 We can give rewards or price money to people who gives us leads against human traffickers and simultaneously they can also have a right to record their conversations with police and other authorities to ensure that they kept their point
1 1 Police reform. Many people in India do not trust their police. They don't file FIR, they feel unsafe from police.
0 0 it will be a costlier job for the government but in order to ensure the security of the citizen a global positioning system (gps) circuit should be fitted inside the body organ so that if a child or any girl is missing then use the gps trackers police can get the exact location where the victim and hence human trafficing will be prevented
2 0 Govt of India should take initiative.All children found in street begging should be adopted just like Norwey and should be given to some genuine NGO like Bachpan Bachao.There should be a rule that if parent is not capable to keep them properly ,Govt will adopt the child.It will also a repulsive force for theft of Child and Anti trafficking
0 0 Now the time has come for all of us to convey opinion to respected FM regarding Direct taxation to be proposed in budget. Since inflation has moderated, Crop production is good, manufacturing sector is growing, 'MAKE IN INDIA' is gathering momentum, Crude petroleum rate is nose diving, rupee value against dollar is stable,  our FM must increase base taxation limit be raised to Rs.5 lakhs and section 80(cc)  must be changed to Rs.2.5 lakhs. This measure increases savings rate.
0 0 Please take up the matter of Sureshbhai Patel ( Indian) who was seriously injured by US policeman in Albama. President Obama want 1 million tourist to come to US? with this treatment to innocent Indians I suggest that our government must take up the matter very seriously with the US government.
2 0 The main causes of BJP defeat in Delhli Polls i guess are :- 1) Not making any weighted commitment to the public 2) Missing of impressive speeches of PM 3) Non focused approach of local leaders 4) Non acceptance of Kiran as a efficient Political leader 5) people will listen religious speeches when they will have basic needs. 6) should have not focused what arvind is doing else what the BJP willing to perform 7) Ground level accepted leader is a major concern since 1993
0 0 Now the demand for Delhi as a full state will be on main agenda. As I remember, until late 50's Delhi was a full state.It was then changed to UT.and then present model.Our previous planners were wise enough to change the status and not holding Delhi as a full state. I suggest, Let Delhi be a granted statehood, baring NDMC area.It should be renamed as "CAPITAL CITY" It will be similar to American arrangements.The modalities can be worked out by planners.
0 0 Dear sir , Was very disturbed to learn about the Nirbhaya case and description about the kamathipura red light district. Requesting you to get India get rid of these. Thank you..
0 0 The impression given to the auto and taxi operators is that APP has reduced the CNG cost bt you need not reduce the fare.This I discovered during discussions from the auto/taxi operators. Let us find means for direct passing the benefits to the masses.
2 0 Sir i has very  upset from the result of new Delhi but don't worry we youth all with us I hop our gov make better performance in next elections thank u sir.....
1 0 human trafficking includes exploitatively using gullible nature of the general public and in fact whole nations and the world itself by selling them unnecessary and unsustainable concepts of development as being the sole repositories of happiness thereby creating a mad rush for those developmental parameters which ultimately lead to disruption of peace and disharmony in the general environs leading to destruction of public peace and harmony
0 0 Parents should be very careful while bringing their children to public places like shopping mall and other places. Often some parents end up forgetting their children in the process of selecting the groceries and in talking in mobile phones. If parents can keep an eye on their children where ever they go they can prevent and can find easily who are targeting the children.Children also should be taught to remember the mobile number of the parents. So that it will be easy to them to locate parents
1 0 Tribal areas where the tribal students resident camps/hostels are available should be monitored and audited thoroughly.MSW students worked on these areas should be asked to record their experiences with government bodies in a secured way.There are missing cases which are associated with local politicians in these kind of camps.The students interacted with them or studied the structure could have observed about the missing girl children,but they could have been able to do nothing in those cases.
1 0 I would request the admin to kindly collate the suggestions received and share in a draft document so that we can add on to that. We can also know if our suggestions are accepted or rejected .
0 0 1. RCA:  HIgher overseas economic condition 2. Lower domestic econimc condition 3. Adoptions & 3 parents laws getting passed. 4. Indian Brain & physiological advantages are getting valued for bringing bodies over seas. 5. Demand stops then the supply. 6. Ambassies officials in overseas to be considered with this additioanl protecting responsibilities. 7. Employement exchanges runs rackets by agents sending poor people on selling basis. Such agents to be raided most often than not.
0 1 First of all, we should awake and see what is happening in our society. Is everything alright.Without our cooperation nothing would be alright. We can stop human trafficking by help the administration and the person who is victim. Government should has to employed special secret agents for stopping human trafficking.
0 0 Our goverment. Taken good decision on behalf of policy, we are not taking action on ganga policy. Hon,ble minister ms. Uma Bharti waisting money or time only. Policy implement nothing so please we gear up to your policy on Ganga and other sector.
0 1 We are making good policy but not implement which is must for good result.
0 0 Revolutionize the Police force, petrolling and scanning techniques. Still there are lost of kids working, beggars begging and small small unacceptable things happening which is being overlooked by the department as small, but these things have created a trend and been taken for granted.
0 0 Mass awareness, education, specific training to parents to save children from such mishap, campaign etc mostly in rural and slum areas.
0 0 IF we want that our country should be also considered as a developed country first of all strict laws should be made .there should be no delay in punishment.Punishment  given by courts like 16 december  rape case culprits are still not hanged.
0 0 strict rules, hard law. more adhaar linked identity.camera recording at rly. bus stations.
0 0 Sir,I request u plz.take care of the beggars who must be roaming here and there for only food .sir we should not be that much cruel to them plz.sir first give them facilities or some work that they will not ask anyone money instead of doing work .Really sir,it will definitely work for our country.Give them chance to work for them and their country.plz.and bring completely ban on begging .plz.sir plz.If we do this,one country will be on leading position.
0 0 Human trafficking in now day is on its heights of crimes as no body cares for those depress people .street children's are the most risk as being in open the people never see them as people are busy so there parents have forgot about them depending on begging .  they can be easily motivated to anything as they want money at any cost so they can be taken to distance from home and in name of work they are sold or anything people who are doing big offence are unidentified and day by day we lose ofus
0 0 To help HUMAN TRAFFICKING >HELP ALL Strict Monitoring of NGO organizations, Strict monitoring of mentally retarded hospitals and very strict check on the beggars list of areas - as they are sorted area wise and every police station should be able to know the groups and any new group arrived. Strict dock yard checkings - especially containers with cargo ships where bulk transfer happen as shown in movies/serials too.
1 0 The boys working in Dhabas are bought from their parents and are made to work without payment until the money is paid back, through their work. They do not receive education or clean accommodation or proper food. While it is necessary with immediate attention to free these trafficked children from the Dhabas, the post-release action needs to be taken. 1. To regularly monitor these dhabas for such trafficking. 2. Provide free education to these children. 3. Provide employment to their parents.
4 0 One major step towards combating Human Trafficking is to stop child labor in Dhabas (roadside hotels). I work in Bihar and in every Dhaba along the Highways you can find 3 to 4 small boys working; they clean the utensils & the premises and serve the table. They are forced to work throughout the day. They get very few hours of sleep and their eyes are swollen and moist due to that. They live in unhygienic conditions and are even habituated to drugs by the owners themselves are they are abused.
1 0 Parents need to be extra alert to save their children from getting into wrong hands .Proper information to be shared. Pros and cons to be discussed with them . How to ask for help in the time of crises need to be shared. Some code word or plan of action needs to be worked out to prepare within the family to get the help or get information about the whereabouts of each other. This is becoming so common practice and any person can fall prey to it. Age is no criteria. Only need is to remain alert .
1 0 Some rule should be made where anyone who sees any wrong doing or see children made to work forcefully at any place should be able to rescue the child with the help of police and children should be united with their family. People are utilizing in Hotels, factories of various kinds, house hold jobs and list is endless. Till the time everyone gets the authority will not be able to help much.

2 0 Anti Human trafficking law needs to be implemented  for all those who do not think twice before doing such act. This action is worst than any harm done by animals to humans. Animal react or act to save himself or getting scared. But when any person indulge into this act does it for money only.Is money becoming more important than human life and values.All those who are involved in trafficking need to be put behind the bars. All the agencies which are entertaining these culprits need to stop.

It will be great if more info is provided it will encourage many members to participate and contribute more through MyGov portal. Kindly instruct the concerned officials to give more info about credit points.

The Government should promagulate one child norm in the country like China so that benefit of sustainable growth can reach them and poverty eliminated at the instance. then only the country can grow and inflation can be controlled in real sense. The rapidly rising population put pressure on economy by using more natural resources and insufficiency of innumerable jobs and increase ailments too...

Everything is done through mechanisation and in a tidy manner.  Albeit we are endowed with rich H.R. yet, we have failed on many fronts which needs to be looked into and this should serve as an eye-opener for those in power. Merely according gregarious credence to the anachronic rules will only be vitiative and will not do anygood

While we blindly and indiscriminately ape the west in many unwanted areas and defray a lot of expenditure of public money  - even I would say a total wastage of Govt. money - for study tours, we should copy USA in this particular field of preservation of the natural resources.

Is this the lesson we have learnt from Puranas like Bhagavatham, Ramayana, etc.  In USA, everything is controlled through exercise of enforcement machinery and one cannot violate the rules and go scot free as that of our country which is endowed with rich heritage and culture.  The only medication that is the need of the hour is regulatory measure to be in place. Even felling of 150 year or 200 year old trees should be totally banned.  In Karnataka, this is

Recently, in Mysore, students from the educational institutions took out procession demanding total ban on fire crackers.

0 0 Dear P.M. While I am in complete agreement with your Swach Bharat scheme launched recently, yet, this is also fraught with so many loopholes. Levying cess (Estimated amount Rs.1 lac crore) will be a retrograde step and may squeeze the people of their hard earned money.  Levying tax in the days of yore like Ramayana, etc. was commensurate with the financial conditions of the denizens. Merely sweeping for the sake of publicity by the VIPs. etc. may not bring the desired results.  If we are serious
0 0 Continued from previous. Delhi Police.  Merely letting these brilliant cyber criminals scot free will only allow them to indulge in such nefarious activities more brazenly and without the fear of their being prosecuted. It is a shameful one here in Bangalore that one BJP corporator was flaunting a copy of fake documents for possession of Commissioner's Mother land by greasing the palms of revenue officials a hefty sum.  This only proves how brazenly the corruption is rampant in State Govt
0 0 Continued from my previous post.  I was asked to deposit a hefty sum to get back the matured amount which is likely to take 3 or 4 months' time.  To-day's newspaper report says that a gullible farmer has been duped of his amount in his bank account by someone in Delhi after extracting his ATM Card No. and PIn which is quite disturbing.  While it may take a lot of time in investigation by the police to track the culprits, it is high time that noose should be tightened around these urchins by
0 0 Dear Prime Minister, Of course, what you are contemplating is par excellent. But, there are other grey areas like control of the menace of pick pockets, development of roads for better commercial viabiity, extirpation of the criminal gangs operating from Delhi, being the hub of cyber crimes and targeting gullible people like farmers, etc. in Karnataka. Even I had the bitter taste of this gang when someone by fake name from Delhi rang up to say that my Insurance Policy had fetched a whopping sum.
0 0 IT is high time that the present Govt. in stead of exercising administration and control of the consumer needs of Cable TV and DTH, should excogitate to enact legislation whereby these two segments could be effectively controlled without causing much nuisance to the consumers.   Will the present Govt. ruminate over these and do the needful for its implementation?  Another worrying feature is the cyber crime whereby gullible Southern States are targeted from the criminals of Delhi which is haven
0 0 BEFORE introduction of CAS, everything was proceeding smoothly and without any hassle.  Of course, there may have been some problems elsewhere.  Overall, it was having a smooth sailing without much impediments.  Even for DTH, this is being regulated through the policy measures which may not be conducive to have an efficient and stricter control over the DTH giants like Sun DTH, etc.
0 0 THE recent unilateral and arbitrary hike in the Cable and DTH charges in a mediocre city like Mysore needs to be curbed.  All these problems had started with the introduction of the CAS by the Min. of I&B where there is neither any Act or Rule for exercising control over the cable monopoly.  There is only a single cable TV provider and there is no competition like DTH where tariff could be a challenging one and there will be stiff competition between the service providers. .
0 0 In Mysore, cable charges are totally arbitrary and are scotfree.  The Sun Group, for its part, is also looting by removing abruptly from the list of cable channels their most sought after channels like SUN TV, Sun News, Chutti, Sun Music, etc. for which they charge separately as paid TV channels. While DTH also vies with the jacking up of their charges, there is no regulatory or control measures.  For their part, TRAI also increases the tariff.

In spite of good results they forced to stay home because of this hectic admission process.
1 0 Respected Sir I am having just on daughter & now she is in 10st (CBSC). I am confident that she will do well in up coming final exams. But from now I am worried about her 11st admission. The reason is the the admission process. Its very complicated. Even after having school leaving certificate which has information on the student like his caste,school joining date,parents name etc. But during admission domisiale caste ,income  is asked is hectic job. Avoid all this formality for  girl child.
1 0 Best Way to  Stop Anti Human Trafficking is by way of having (1) Community Social Group or NGO for Counselling. (2) Police Dedicated  & Separate Cell - For Tracking " Human Traffickers" in Cities/Villages (3) "Informers " to Police are the Biggest & Direct Help to Track Human Traffickers. (4) No Job or Employment  & Good Source of Income to People in Cities/Villages - Leads to Human Trafficking Business to Flourish. (5) Media Can Play Big Role in Identifying & Spreading Awareness.
0 0 Dear PM, Why FCI reforms are not being implemented. Delay in those reforms is resulting in huge leakage and misdirection of food subsidies. FCI field managers earn upto 1 crore of money per year through corruption. FCI reforms have the ability to bring gains to our farmers (producers), poor Indians (consumers) as well as food based manufacturing industry. This complex issue can not discussed in 500 characters here, but it needs urgent attention of your govt.

Though those govt servants want to participate, but hesitate to be seen as part of RSS citing Central Civil Service rule 5, Point 12, para 2 which bans them from being member of RSS and Jamaat-e-Islami. Its shameful to club RSS with Jamaat-i-Islami. We understand this rule was brought in 1964, but now in today's changed scenario please rectify this. Thanks, Nitin
0 0 A..LET THE RICH CONSUME IN ABOVE 3 OR 5 STAR HOTELS; B..LET THE LIQUOR BE SOLD IN GOVT OUTLETS; BY SELLING LIQUOR FEW BECOME BILLIONEIR/CAPITALIST OVERNIGHT AND SLOWLY THEY BECOME LAW MAKERS. C-..LET THE PRICE OF LIQUOR BE VERY COSTLY:  if the liquor is VERY COSTLY, so that price be above the reach of poor, price of a goods increases, individuals will purchase/consume less. It is evident that youth at a very tender age spoil their life by starting to consume liquor, this is  serious.
0 0 I am writing this ONLY with the intension of  how to improve quality of Citizens, in this line I am also advocating for banning of consumption as well as selling of Liquor, if not  fully, at least below poverty line. According to me the Government must work towards a welfare States, think and work to improve the quality of Citizens, so that they can help and contribute towards making a strong India. Sir, by selling & consuming Liquor, the government is making its CITIZENS USELESS.
0 0 BAN LIQUOR – TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF CITIZENS, BY SELLING & ALLOWING IT TO CONSUME, NO DOUBT GOVT IS MAKING MONEY –BUT AT THE COST OF CITIZENS HEALTH- GOVT. IS MAKING  ITS OWN CITIZENS  USELESS, BY KILLING THEIR POTENTIAL, CAUSING FAMILY TURBULANCE. TO BUILD A STRONG NATION IT IS NEED OF HOUR TO BAN LIQUOR ACROSS, IF NOT POSSIBLE FULLY, AT LEAST BELOW POVERTY LINE.
0 0 Dear PM, Good to hear all the plans of Infrastructure Development by our new Govt. But cost of this development can be reduced if we remove the commission which contractors have to pay to Babus in Govt Dept (example, PWD dept in Punjab). Every one knows that when you quote for any road project, you have to account for 13% commission to be paid to whole heirarchy of Babus in the dept. THIS 13% commission culture has got deep rooted now and is resulting in very poor quality of Infrastructure.
0 0 I have been residing at Bangalore for the last 12 years. hence witnessed a radical transformation here. The only thing that I feel is not keeping pace with the kind of interest this city is attracting is development. An apt indicator would be the fact that it take about an hour to travel a distance of 13 kms here. i would walk it down to be faster but that would be like risking my life everyday. The way I see it, the problems of this city cannot be solved without an iron will and fist.

I further want to add that you need to sack more officers in the government who are carrying the congress ball to further their agenda and make Indians ashamed, as if we are nothing.

0 0 All Public Transport vehicles such as buses, private taxis and vehicles with yellow and black number plates should be GPS compliant for better traffic and safety on roads.
0 0 The next topic for Man KI Baat should be Traffic on Indian Roads. This will not only address Economic Issues but also Social and Safety aspects. Use of Public Transport, Car pools should be encouraged thereby optimizing the use of natural resources, reducing pollution and bringing about sanctity, safety to all Road users. Idling of vehicles in traffic is a big waste of natural resources , highly polluting and stressful. Are we pursuing a false GDP by manufacture of large number of cars?
0 0 The New Education Policy should have Community Service as one subject with either 50 or 100 marks. Community Service should include cleanliness drive  to achieve the objectives of Swaach Bharat.

Community Service should also include such civic activities  that require inculcating discipline for a better India
0 0 I knew personally and I heard from Top leaders speech on TVs about human trafficking. India has to develop strong and efficient policy irrespective of caste or religion ideas against human trafficking. We should not discriminate any person in the society, who has done crime must be punished and put into jail. Who are not done crime should not punish. I request to PM sir, please do propaganda among police and govt employees must follow ethics and law in highest regard to people
0 0 Human trafficking pushes the human race in to worst animal race.The worst part in this is the most of the victims are of socially weaker sections like women and children. The poverty drive them towrds this. The acts at present to prevent this are not implemented especially at the grass root level.Corruption at lower level should be eliminated after that People and officers who are doing ground work should be empowered more to prevent human trafficking.Another way is empowering women economically

Even now, I make it a point to visit the kiosk whenever I happen to be in JSR. Last time it was quite sometime back. I hope he has moved far beyond in all these years.

Within a year, he had moved from being a handicapped virtual beggar 2 a confident/ self made entrepreneur-from a dole seeker to a job/wealth creator-he had now given job to 2/3 guys.. In my long carrier in SBI, I have done hundreds of credit proposals-domestic/international-bilateral/syndications in all currencies but I still consider the small loan of Rs 60 as the most satisfying.and rewarding.

0 0 Poor and illiterate people are usually cheated by traffickers. They are told that "we will take your child to the city and he/she will get employment". The parents trust them and hand over their children. So people should be educated to not trust such people. They should also be made aware that people can pretend to marry their daughters and then use them for trafficking. And also important is solving the financial problems of such people so that they don't hand over their kids for such reasons.

0 0 I want to share some idea on anti-corruption. I am working in Muscat(Oman) and I have noticed that all the government paper work fees is done through ATM/Debit Card. The culprit will not take risk to take bribe or extra money because customer has a proof as bank statement of ATM usage and ATM usage receipt. Customer can go to the police and show the proofs.Cash has no track record,where and how much money is wasted at each level in the process.

0 0 Creating a Sustainable Agriculture Dear Prime Minister, It is very important that we create a sustainable agriculture environment to take care of our farmers. It is an irony that people who feed us are the ones who commit suicide on account of poverty and hunger. I would suggest a special purpose vehicle for the same which can use "Contract Farming" to consolidate the land (only for cropping purposes) with a guarantee or ownership to the farmer. This can be guaranteed by the Government.
0 0 I really want to see the BJP led MODI government prevent corruption by not printing the high denomination RUPEE notes, they should bring this legislation, they have enough majority to pass the house without any dependency. All the developed countries stopped/limited corruption with this legislation in the past. It is a proven solution, it did wonders in lot of countries like UK and USA. People should use the bank accounts for most of there transactions. Please support this!!
0 0 Prevent corruption - anti corruption department appeals every one to come forward and complain against government officials asking for bribes. The problem quite often is people are feared that their work will never be done by the same department as part of grudge on making  complainit.  My suggestion is - government should assure that if people complain against asking for bribe their job will be done in stipulated time period (e.g. in 5 working days) and someone will make sure job is done.

0 0 #Yes we can is a good theme that need transformation in real sense if the youth of the nation get respective chances in their fields. The possibilities and results will be beyond our thinking if every individual given a chance to perform and deliver. The current pace of development is merely 10% as the talent is not getting the exposure they want in their field. Engineering, medical, teaching, defence, politics, arts and many other fields are available but need is opportunity to the smart youth.
0 0 I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE RAILWAY PLATFORM IN  CHINA..SO NEAT AND CLEAN..NO OVERCROWDING ..ONLY THOSE WHO HAD TICKETS WERE ALLOWED TO ENTER PLATFORMS.NO SHOPS, ...A LADY CONDUCTOR IN THE COACH COLLECTED ALL THE GARBAGE IN A PLASTIC BAG...FURTHER, THERE SHOULD BE SOME MORE WIDE GALARIES IN THE COACHES... .
0 0 TO MINISTRY OF RAILWAY: I SUGGESTTO CHANGE THE COLOR OF RAILWAY COACHES.PRESENTLY , IT IS DUST/RUST COLOR AND IT IS NOT VISIBLE IN THE DARK AND HAS CAUSED MANY ACCIDENTS.IF COLOUR OF THE COACHES IS CHANGED TO YELLOW AND  ALL CORNERS HAVING LINING OF FROURESCENT STRIPS THEN IT WILL SIGN EVEN INDIM LIGHTS AND ANIMALS NEAR TRACK CAN ALSO SEE THAT SOMETHING BRIGHT IS COMING...THIS WILL BE A GREAT STEP TO REDUSE ACCIDENTS...

Mera sabal yeh hai ki train late hone par hume railway se claim milna chahiye taki railway aise system lagu kar sake jisse train late na ho aur yadi late ho to railway apne yatio ko ganto ke hisaab se claim degi
0 0 Today I saw my housekeeper who collect waste from all houses of my colony, but he do not wear globes and collect garbage with his naked hand he was with his wife and two children. What do government do for their health. Why they don't wear globes and mask etc., why their children were not going to school
0 0 Why government jobs have age limits, while private jobs don't have any age limit, so that talented persons can join his favorite company in any age before 60.
1 0 Make a committee with an activist as it's hea
0 0 Outsource traffic system on PPP model.  Invite bids for installation of CCTVs camera on red-lights with 24x7 customer care.  Monitor online traffic violations, movements, faults & send the e-challan with image proof at registered address of defaulter with online payment option.  If fails to submit in time, the challan A/m multiplies.  If challenged, for innocence challan  be exempted but for fault it increases by Rs. 500 for wasting court time. Company may charge 10% on each challan deposited
1 0 Stop on-the-spot payment of traffic violation challan.  Traffic cops can note registered address through original RC, Insurance or other documentary proofs & should send challan at residence address only with option of online payment within 15 days of receipt of the notice. In case owner fails to pay challan in 15 days, the challan amount gets multiplies every fortnight & after 3 months a jail of 6 months and penalty.   It will help reducing the bribe system in traffic to some extent.
0 0 where are the jobs sir ...i voted for you , biggest  disappointment i am being facing is the lack quality jobs in biotechnology sector , i have studied this subject till masters level  ....what kind of this is this ...government jobs zero ...private jobs not there ....where are we heading ...do something sir .
2 0 To make Swachh Bharat sucessful, all Municipal Boards and Corp. of India should allowed to bring IPOs and issue shares to public by which they will raise huge funds and list and trade on stock market, by that huge funds they may buy Machines, world class equipment and employ good quality professionals in Corporation. With this the Corporations may start providing high end services to clean areas or location and charge a pre fixed expenditure model and easy monthly installments from RWAs etc.
1 0 There should be simpleness in tax laws and bribes by officers should be checked should take hard step against who take bribe as income tax officers interested in only taking bribes not their duty properly.
0 0 India has more prominent places like  Taj Mahal.   Especially in south India large temples of architecture exhibiting our ancestors mastery in civil construction.  Understand Agra is nearby   to Delhi. But Taj alone is not a master piece to show to the world.
0 0 For RuPay card the gov. while issuing it should put the photo of the account holder and also should mention the Adhar card no. on that so it can be used as id proof.
0 0 Health insurances should be made compulsory while filling any gov. Declarations, right from school admissions to income tax returns. With Adhar cards to voter's card or even making a notarized documents. It should be clubbed with Adhar card and bank account. The insurance documents should be treated as any other document proof for id or address. To avail any facilities from Gov one should produce any type of insurance cover.
1 0 Sir  after  getting ideas  on  dIfferent issues  you  must begin to implement on it.
3 0 There are three groups. First is those who are "responsible for Human Trafficking". Severe punishments should be given to those involved in human trafficking business (prostitution, begging, child labor). The second  is "users". Users need to understand that human trafficking is un-human and is crime punishable by laws. The third group is "victims". Most of these people are not aware of their rights to live in human society.  Education, and help from society to live productive life is essential.
0 0 goals, targets ,objectives and VISSION & MISSION of IDEAL,MODEL AND WELFARE SOCIETY AS PURE. PEACEFUL , PROSPEROUS, CLEAN, SAFE AND FREE FROM CORRUPTION, NEPOTISM & FAVORITISM - THE WORLD,WE WANT AS"SPIRITUALITY" IS THE PANACEA FOR ALL CRIMES, EVILS AND ULTIMATE SOLUTION FOR ALL PROBLEMS !!!
0 0 Human beings should not be treated as a commodity, everyone of us has the right to live with dignity. But few people out of greed for money have got into this evil of what they call as their business, it is a shame that people can get so low. One should ask them don't they have families, with mothers, sisters, wives?
0 0 It is heartening that the governmnent has thought it fit to mention Human Trafficking as a concern. (Please refer to DNA's coverage of trafficking - the final part was in today's paper). Mostly, poor and powerless people are the victims of this trade. So I suggest stringent punishment (including RI in jail) for policemen who look the other way/refuse to take down complaints, the end-users (the rich people of posh Delhi/Bangalore colonies) who exploit these people mercilessly, and the agents.
0 0 Sir....What i think the only way to stop this is by developing a co-ordination between the police of different states...and they should be accountable for their respective steps... and it will be more effective if you create the special wing fully dedicated  for these cases..this is not a matter of 10-20 people...actually this is a matter of millions of indian citizen who is directly or indirectly attached to it.....
1 0 Sir human trafficking also uses internet and social networking sites to lure people.we need to create awareness among the young people not to share sensitive information with strangers and also to enlist the support of cyber to know the identity of various websites that offer jobs.
1 0 There will be make a plan to stop human  trafficking.
1 0 This appalling problem of human trafficking that we face today has insidiously taken it's course because of lack of seriousness on the issue shown by implementers.I hope that is no more the case.
2 0 Modi-Obama joint 'Man Ki Bat': Skill and technology (Daksh) is special virtue of America. A the peak of it the collective consciousness gets the zeal to meet Supreme Consciousness ( Shiva).  India has the required expertise. If they can marry their material consciousness with India's pure consciousness then it is a perfect Ardhnariswar state. A selfless and eternal relationship without boundaries.
2 1 Human trafficking need to be tackled with heavy hands.  Till the time there is no fear in the minds of the people involved in this henious crime, they will continue.  The present system seems to have failed in controlling this problem.  The best way is to have a separate Cell under the Home Ministry with special task force backed with local informers. The branches should be set up in each state. Strict vigil should be in the vulnerable areas with randam checks of suspected vehicles, trains, buses, etc.
0 0 Please give the Human Rights Education for the whole Nation so people may understand the concept of Human Rights and also increase in knowing the Social ethics of behaving to others.
0 0 Sir please increase character limit for posts. Sometimes it is too difficult to express our feelings in 500 characters.
1 0 Sir, how will I know if any government official has read my comments or posts? Please provide mechanism to tell if the post has been seen by the PMO or any reliable department in the Government, liked or unliked. It should be informed through SMS.
0 0 We can create a separate temporary (e.g for five years) anti-trafficking unit under the central or states home ministry  and giving that unit certain powers like CBI.
0 0 sir, now a days farmers are very angry on government policy, they didn't get that why government stop's export of many things??
0 0 Sir Regarding Railway  Facility we are from Coast Parts of Karnataka and the people are totally depends on Land / Railway and we dont have  proper train connectivity . When DV Sadandna Gowda is minister he proposed day train to blore to blore but our badluck he was removed from Ministry  till today train is not started .so i request you pls instruct the Railway minsitry to look into our issue. regards Pradeep
0 0 Human Trafficking is a  problem can be eradicate within 180 days No. 1:- all political people those elected by the people have to treated as honorary employees of Central Govt, 2. Their remunerations/pensions  should be give by central Govt. 3. If they not taken retirement from active politics then they will hold responsible for this type of Trafficking. 4. All members have to visit their respective area with 15 days intervals(except Ministers) & with signature at Panchayat.
3 1 ban porn sites sir,
1 0 regarding education i feel we should develop our ancient time systems because even that time if people pass metric he will be more knowledgeable than today's graduate students. I personally feel we all study only as exam oriented not for knowledge, because we give more importance to certificates rank more than present talent and work capacity of that person. also there is lot of restriction on teachers. so we should think about it.
2 1 i feel that now a days all bad activities regarding girls or with child's are happening because of peoples miss understanding. under the banner of sex education not all but mass number of ppl are getting wrong things in hand. so all seductive websites should be banned and it should be done by the court, if they restrict the majorly used webs like Google, then it will happen. also i request to pm that on this 26th jan please aware ppl regarding it
0 0 I want to discuss the topic of education in India we all know very well over government is investing a huge amount of money in government school but the government is not getting that much success. Government is providing mid day mel , Scholarship and free study account of this we are not collecting 20-30 students in school. Why it is so...???
0 0 please take d issue of terrorist activity in pakistan,misuse of capital aid given by americans to pakistan...also talk about the bhopal gas tragedy...
1 1 I think that In RTE act 2009 , there should be ammendment. In Private school 25% seats should be reserve for BPL ST/ SC family.
1 0 I think that government should plan for traffic lights at every turned roads to avoid  accidents and at every traffic light a traffic police officer should be there who is honest and does his duty correctly so that every citizen of india respects traffic rules and regulations
2 0 all human traffiking in india supported by politicians,police officer and other high profile people....number of law made on human traffiking... UPA gov. launch"UJJAWALA" PROJECT to halted human traffiking... honable PM serious we require a stroged determination and awareness about human traffiking in general public. please add a chapter of human traffiking add in 6th to 12th class in social science. A strong determination by all politician to stop human traffiking and a strike punishment for criminal invove in traffiking...
0 0 Due to communication gap & due brokers/agent this type of offence occurring several time, while maximum number  of  people required for farming & cultivation still agents/dalals are able for trafficking due to our mismanagement, if we are able to provide work  from private sector/public sector then we can only solve the problems permanently.
0 0 It is one of the biggest social problems that we are facing today in this 21st century. Definitely in this era of knowledge and social development this problem is a black spot on humanity and a shame for those who still have not understood the meaning of independence and freedom for all. We have always fought for the cause of social equality but still a section of devils present within our very own society don't understand this. The problem is too big but we have to find a solution to it .
1 0 BETI BACHAO BETI PATHAO, YOGA FOR GOOD HEALTH AND ENERGY SAVING ARE GOOD STEPS. EDUCATED INDIA WILL PREVENT HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND MAKE IT PROSPEROUS COUNTRY. PRIVATIZATION OF ORDNANCE FACTORIES ARE GOOD STEPS AND IT IS WELCOME. THOSE WHO DO NOT WORK GOOD MAY BE FORCEFULLY RETIRED FROM SERVICE AND THEIR WARDS MAY BE PROVIDED CHANCE TO WORK IN THAT ORGANISATION.

0 0 Dear sir,my opinion is all private sectors should come in govt undertaken and one separate commission should me make because all private companies only think about self not think about employees such as salary structures, working hrs and employee welfare.
0 0 Fast and fair justice is a great necessity of today.
0 0 Dear Sir, My Suggestion is for improving the Traffic system in India..All you need to do is to give a deadline for 3/6 mnth to all DL holders to get their licence renewed for free..The existing DL will be invalid after that date..All that they have to do is to go to Respective RTO personally and give a basic 10 points Driving test,Which will have basic knowledge and Rules of Driving a vehicle in India, If one passes this test his DL will be renewed if not his existing DL will be cancelled
0 0 Sir, Giving degree to any youth from any field law must be there to serve nathion for atleast one year under proper guidance like article ship / trainee of professional courses

I  strongly believe when it comes to desk.  maximum with in two months it must be ordered. what for and why so many dates  of after 15 days or months  given and lingering the case? please see it and do the need full
0 0 Sir, the core issue driving trafficking is poverty & lack of employment. Hence, sufficient development of all regions, improvement in agriculture & industry will reduce this menace. However, rehabilitation measures are needed for those rescued so as to prevent them from returning to their old ways. the role of government, society & NGO's is equal. We should stand as one to prevent child labour, organised trafficking in women & indentured labour.Better intelligence at local level is needed.
0 0 Government of India can make use of ROBOTS at border areas at vulnerable and possible checkpoints where the terrorists can enter in the Indian boundary and at Sea, Mountains and Inland areas where there is greater risk to life. These robots can help a lot in strengthening the armed bases and can be used in combating terrorism and Gorilla attacks at enemy/militants. The task of building robots can be assigned to technical institutes like IITs and through more FDI and foreign defence deals.
2 0 Gov should add new scientific topics to the primary schools and should appoint teacher for this task.when students will get this knowledge at primary stage,then they will try to build Digital India..Their participation from their  primary age will help our nation
0 0 I have been associated with Modi for the past 8 yeas of my business with gujarath i understand your method fully.  unfortunately our country is so much divided by caste and religion and greedy unethical politicians no body is able to make the best out of you
0 0 India has not produced any Nobel prize winner in science in the last 85 years. Is it due to the lack of great ideas or scientist or the lack of scientific environment in the country? I kindly request to the government that plz provide opportunities for scientific hungers. We are eagerly waiting to do something different in science that takes indias pride high.
1 0 Does anyone from govt offices reads these posts? For example, does Honorable PM Shri Modi even know what people are posting here?
0 1 There is a practice going on in UP since Mayawati's rule till today that on liquor quarter Rs 5 half 10/- and on full bottle Rs 20 is being charged extra on Printed MRP. No one is ready to listen, not Police, not Media, not Vendor. As per Vendors the money goes upto Chief Minister. I want to draw your attention towards this open loot going on in whole UP's Jungle Raj. Any one can confirm this by practically Buying from any vendor. I am not in favour of encouraging drinking but against the loot.
0 0 I work in a mental hospital.  There are many persons who have been lost and have been admitted by court order. We are failing to find there relatives. If one national software can be formed which will tell the names of the relatives of one person, when the name/ fingerprint/ photographs of the lost person is put to the software,  it may be of help. This can be done with the help of voter id card or ADHAAR card etc.
0 0 Focus: We are heading towards becoming a strong economy in coming future but are the developments so claimed are visible to common people. Why don't we get focused on say one or at max two steps at  a time. for example lets take Roads and electricity supply. once these two facilities are development it can be assured that development will be paced and synchronized at the same time with that of common people. instead of starting too many initiatives it might be judicious to stick to one direction
0 0 On 6th nov. I have my desire for kiran bedi, and  today she is in bjp, thanks,  kash god se kuch aur  bhi manga hota
0 0 Child forced labor & slavery to be banned . No dowry . Dowry system shld banned at grass root level.  Other small job to be given by government to prostitutes who want to leave their current work . Pros. should get respect in the society i they want to change their job.
0 0 LED roof-top lighting can be placed in each houses, where there is no street light to avoid any criminal act in dark places. Also, there is no column to write about the ideas to fight against terror in ur website, pls add it.
1 0 Strict laws should be mad
0 1 To my understanding, we must not get swayed by political attack and start taking economy unfriendly decisions. Fuel price in the range of Rs 60  (petrol) and Rs 55 (Diesel) is an equilibrium position. No need for any reduction. The govt. in turn sohuld focus on fiscal consolidation creating extra infrastructure ... from the surplus money. regds
0 0 HOW GET JOB IN DIGITAL INDIA IN HARYANA ANYONE  TELL
1 0 How pity it is to see a man begging in the silver paint on the popular locations . Though he just wants to fill his belly with our penny, its quite a disgrace for me to see the man who is begging pretending in the posture of mahatma gandhiji . I request the authorities to at least ban people begging in the silver paint .  Gandhiji would be delighted to see a swatch Bharat , but would never feel proud watching over a guy begging in his disguise.
1 0 Garbage at One Place is Raw material at other this we should keep in mind.If Govt. agencies open depots for purchase of  garbage items like glass, paper, polythene , plastic items and all unused items which are thrown on roads and other places. All the garbage items are automatically collected at depots and from there the recycler of old paper, polythene cow dung glass , metal old furniture, clothes electronic items will collect paying a handsome fee that can be used to run the depot.

0 0 The Retail price of all items (MRP) in the market is decided by the Producer of those items and MRP is marked, except Agriculture products. Why a method for the agriculturist to fix the price of their product can not be envisaged so that the agriculturist or farmers of our country will be benefited. The price of their products are now decided by the middle men procuring/ selling their products. Cannot we have procedure by which a farmers body will decide the price of their product?.
0 0 Please see the horrible conditions of salary structure of contractual  staffs of various Central Govt. Schemes in Tripura. Sir please explain how can we survive with the lowest salary. I am getting Rs. 10,800.00 p.m. under NHM. please sir. Help us

1 0 It is Good that our Economy is steadily Progressing at a Growth Phase, with more number of Literates. But Unfortunate scenario is People have forgotten the Basics of Treating our fellow citizens by giving respect., Ego clashes have increased and Humanity is getting lost slowly. I guess the best wayto bring back humanity is fight against ego clashes and hatredness. This will not only make india proud but also other countries in the world will learn from us and entire world will become clean
0 0 Sir in 1947 we were allotted some land by govt which was left behind by people who went to Pakistan on their will n wish. That land is called madruka and even today we don't have any right to that land even still we r cultivating it.if any day govt want to take it they don't give a single rupee to us and our consent is not required. It is still on the name of those who are in pakistan . land to tiller bill says after 5 yrs of cultivating tiller has 50% right but we don't have 1 % after 67 yrs

0 0 Good afternoon Sir Today is army day and u have send your best wishes through Facebook twitter etc etc.Can u please abolish sahayak/ orderly system from the army in which a jaw an(combatant soldier) has to clean clothes and polish shoes of officers. Why an officer who calls them army man even after years of retirement can't even polish his shoes or wash his clothes while in service. Britishers started these things but unfortunately no one stopped it even after so many years of independence.
0 0 Modi ji we r looking forward to ur action against corruption. Do reform in field of bureaucracy, judiciary and politics .Education is another field. School management is fleecing parents, public schools teacher r nt getting proper salary.
0 0 omg.....i get goosebumps listening to this.......heart break for the family and the kid being targeted
0 0 We say schools are the best in providing education,our children spends most of the time in school unless they became primary adult age 16/17.If schools are good in providing educations then all tutions needs to be banned completely. Tuition teach our kids aggressions, more for parents...all such institution which are teaching & making good money for themselves needs to be banned.let children should give their inner best which is inside them, why make them competitive in sending such classes ?
0 0 Mr. PM in India there there is a great need to bring people to abide by the law of the land irrespective of their socioeconomic status, religion, caste they belong to and their political clout. The day a criminal or a person with criminal motives thinks he or she cannot get away after committing a crime, is the day when India will see a fall in crime numbers. And to bring about this fear or the need to follow the law of the land, is in the hands of the Govt and it law enforcing agencies.
2 0 Digital Technologies which include Cloud Computing and Mobile Applications have emerged as catalysts for rapid economic growth and citizen empowerment across the globe.when  we are talking about digital India we shoud start from grassroot like we should install CCTV Camera at every signal and also at every sensitive areas so,that we would be able to track every activity.I think this one is great innovation for all digital indian's and deserving maximum LIKES.
2 0 Hon'ble PM, I just want to submit my view as to when the vehicles are stolen and nothing is done by the Police in spite of a F.I.R. In Uttar Pradesh, no Online records are managed when a vehicle has been stolen by & recovered from the thieves. I think....without a proper Online record of the stolen vehicles as well as the recovered vehicles, no one can find a justice in this matter and their respective grievances will be unresolved. A fully computerized system should be installed to see status.
1 0 Sir, Railway and Roads should be world Class.  I love my Prime Minister Modi to take initiate to make these sectors world class.

There is no control on the tution fee and others by the govt. It has to be there. Every child has the right to have a good education in this country,but good schools are charging more and rural/interior schools are not having quality. Govt has to think

1 0 PM Modiji, infrastructure & traffic situation in IT Capital Bangalore is getting worse by every passing day. Even though traffic police are trying their best, there is no improvement. This is creating a bad impression about Bangalore to the outside world as new companies are hesitant to enter Bangalore due to the poor infrastructure. Would it be possible for you to influence the state government here & improve the situation?
1 0 LIKE TO DRAW ATTENTION OF PM TO MAKE ARRANGEMENT AS CSR ACTIVITY BY CORPORATES TO PROVIDE MOBILE DIGITAL VAN WHICH MAY REACH TO REMOTE VILLAGES AND PROVIDE GOVT SERVICES LIKE UID ENROLLMENT.

1 0 It is true that human trafficking origin from ancient times but in recent time it is serious crime. So we can built a system where the birth certificate starts with unique registration number and after each 3 year verify enrollment  and start record education achievements with health routine checkups  up to 18 years after that he/she got  enrolled to election commission and UID etc.,on the basis of that registration number which is provided at the birth certificate time. Implemented to all .
1 0 Need to declare each year as a year dedicated to a personality who worked for betterment of Bharat. Plan many activities throughout the year related to this personality.

0 0 Dear PM With due respect and regret to inform you that I find a primary school operating under the flyover of YAMUNA BANK Metro station. It is exactly when we go to Yamuna Bank Metro Station. They school management any how engraved 7 or 8 black boards on the wall and this winter continued the school under all odds. I hope these children are from nearby poor families. I request you to please ask nearby PUBLIC SCHOOLS to adopt these children with same fee or without adding cost to them.
0 0 Human trafficking most easily takes place through porous land borders. Fencing the whole land border India has with other countries is the simplest solution to prevent cross-border human trafficking, coupled with increased intelligence, and vigilance by authorities concerned in border areas, and those areas prone to trafficking.

0 0 The very first thing that the govt. needs to do is legalize the sex industry and prostitution. Since this business is currently pseudo-legal, sex workers often have to remain shrouded in secrecy. It has long been a hub of human trafficking. Legalizing it would mean hat trafficking victims can come out into the open and seek remedy, without bear of social backlash.

2 0 Sir, Consider converting ESIC & Railway Hospitals as medical institutions will help India to create more AIMS like institutions and save cost of Infra part and offer common people more services. Cost of education in Private is huge and Available PG seats are also limited which forcing our students to go Abroad. both private and Govt colleges can use and offer more services otherwise referred to different hospitals. Financial burden on ESI will be reduced drastically.

0 1 China works ahead of time. They envisage future airline pilots requirement and have already got 8000 students in the state owned flight training academy and will add another 2000 this year so that they do away with expats.

0 1 This system of edu. has made life difficult for so many children. If any1 didn't pass then this society treats them as if they r useless r they should die. It is not possible for every 1 to score 100 r distinction. This society won't see talent and skills, but they see only marks and money. That's y India is still backwards. Since lots of companies don't identify talents ppl r going to foreign to work...

Our system of edu. has been put in corner and made optional but foreign's has been made compulsory. Why? Plz bring back Indian edu. system. It had all activities included in it. But with this foreign ones, children are missing physical edu.. A 7yr old kid must carry his equal weighted bag which affects d growth of them......
0 1 Human Trafficking involves many people and many channels. human trafficking can be controlled by engaging all educated people of the country  in some work or the other, not government jobs only. Secondly awareness through NGOs and anti human trafficking societies should be imparted with serious concern under government guidance, and their workshops should be conducted in schools and colleges at regular intervals. Thirdly anti trafficking apps should me made available to the public.

1 0 Trafficking in human beings is prohibited under article 23 of our constitution so it is the duty of the state to control it. NPR and AADHAR should reach every nook and corner of country.The cases of abduction and disappearance should be addressed at the earliest.Tightening of security and enhanced monitoring & surveillance at state and national borders.Maintain coordination with international agencies.Regular police verification of outsidersin an area.Informal sectors must be scrutinized timely.
0 1 I think NGOs should come forward and provide some skill training and the govt  should provide the market to cash the outputs of the skilled people.
0 2 and to check trafficking in sex workers,they should be legalized, with legalizing STDs may also get checked and it is good way to get revenue as well as to end stigma, they may return back to society as in their old days might have been miserable.and  with proper counselling they should be sent to places where they can earn a life with dignity. Persons trafficked to foreign country may get checked by creating a separate cell in vigilance dept with all necessary powers
3 0 Further, Beggary should be treated as crime and anyone seen begging should be immediately sent to NGOs/government owned place where they can get skill development training.
0 0 to check this pls put check on agents who help in hiring domestic help in metros.They bring children from tribal areas and put them as contractual labour which is more benificial than sex industry.no one is getting benefited in this business except these agents. child labour,human trafficking and tax evasion is closely related and this gives more profit to agents then sending girls to sex industry. Refer to real time experience: http://india-ananalysis.blogspot.in/2014/12/blog-post.html

1 0 Respected PM, The black money is being generated in high rate in mines and minerals department. Government is taking royalty for one truck is just 200Rs, but actually this quantity is being sold in market in 30000Rs in market. So why government is not taking royalty according to the market value of sand. Also government is not giving direct benefit to that panchayat from where mining is done. only 10% royalty share is giving for that panchayat development that is not good policy
0 0 Regarding "Clean Ganga"; I would like to say that ; ..Implement and execute a complete ban on discharge of all sewage lines and tannary/ leather chemical wastes into the river Ganga all along it's bank , and it is advisable to plant trees all along it's bank ; unless and until , these sewage lines and tannary / leather chemical wastes are totally banned , Ganga can't be cleaned...!!!
0 0 Dear Indian government ministers, I have one suggestion to make our India digital. Beggering is as a criminal activity. So I want that please make a law in parliament to banned beggering. Small children boy/girl are beggaring instead of study. Some organizations used children life for business through beggering. My English is good but I please think about my opinion because when I see this type of children I hurt very much . So please take some effective step in this matter.
0 0 at first govt. should focus to make National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking. But, we need sustained research on the nature of human trafficking within and involving all indians. Get involved.Volunteer with a group that is involved in preventing or combating human trafficking or aiding its victims. If you have specific abilities or connections, ask if they could be useful, and be willing to help wherever you are needed. so, voluntarism & National action plan to be needed.
1 0 I suggest transport ministry should look in the possibility of making transfer of vehicle registration number on line .since most of the people who are working in private sectors are frequently transferred and they face lot of difficulty in other state .Also suggest if possible people should be allowed to retain orignal number accross all over india  Suggest government should look in the matter seriously as it impacts over crore of citizens

I do not know if these are cases of child trafficking or not.
1 0 In todays Times of India there is news about sharing the social responsibilities thru donation to various government schemes. Mr.Azim Premjai has donoated around INR 12 K Crores, Vednata Group has donated around INR 1800 Crores. My query is how this money is being utilized ? whether it is being used for the real cause. Since lot funds are getting generated thru donation etc, why not there should be a separate ministry who will monitor and keep the accounting of such heavy donations.

1 0 Birth registration must be made compulsory . Not exercising it be made punishable crime for parents . This can be ensured by a team under census department who would make yearly visit to all the families .It would be like surprise checking . Each child born can be simply recognized by a number and yearly visit would make clear that every child is at regular place. This can help government to reduce crimes at a great extent, paper working of a person would be very easy, easy surveys. Think !!!
0 0 The 2 main reason of low standard of law and order in our country: 1. Most of the IPS officers are people who couldn't make it to IAS / IFS, hence get 3rd option of IPS : Solution-we should have different examination for IPS which is more technical rather than a generalist approach like IAS/IFS/IRS 2. The sub-officer class (the havaldars) should be chosen after 12th and be admitted to a 3 yr training cum graduation course with opportunities to become officers like it is there in Army/CRPF etc.

0 0 4.	In almost every big city government is planning to build BRT (Bus rapid transport). Yes I should be done. IT will help the local public to make their daily life easy and generate revenue to gov. But why ambulance and other emergency service can't be provided with in 30 minute?
1 0 I ask him not to wait and to stop some other vehicle so that we can take this person to hospital on time. He tried to stop one passenger vehicle but he was not agreed to help. Then we stopped a private van, initially he denied but somehow I convinced him to help us. I along with my friend and some other person send this injured guy to hospital. Few points that I observed: 1.	People was looking but not trying to help that guy. 2.	Private vehicle owner does not come in front to help that guy.
0 0 Yesterday while returning from the Lohgarh fort new by Pune, I saw a person who met with a serious accident on Mumbai Pune Highway. I stop my bike to see his condition. I was wonder to saw that the people were around him, looking at him but not taking necessary action in order to save his life. I found one police man there and ask him to call some help he said like he has already informed at nearest police station.
0 0 Going through the groups it is found that there is no group for development of roads which should be taken up as roads and highways plays a major role in development of any country though the available road b network is fair yet it needs much improvement as saving fuel with good roads can help in improvement of our economy and less loss of natural resource
0 0 Social networking sites can be of immense help to curb evil of human trafficking. Concerned Agencies should share informations on such social sites. Unfortunately, apathetic attitude of concerned agencies and lack of interest to utilize recent technological means has given free hands as well as fearless to such criminals involved in human trafficking. Govt. Should direct in very plain words to law&order maintaining agencies to co-relate with common man by all means of technology to curb crime.

0 0 Please help Congress replace Sartaj Aziz on boat issue,please dont allow Bharat and Bhartiya to be let down.
0 0 Human trafficking has become very serious or incurable disease. My opinion is that Central Govt. in association with all State Govts should make a common website with all details of missing persons. A separate/independent agency rather than local police should investigate such cases coz these crimes are done by white collar criminals. Criminal history of such criminals should be disclosed on aforesaid website. Sharing data of missings at national level by all means would be first step. Jai Hind.
0 0 Mother tongue of a district should be the medium of instruction for all non-language subjects(Math, Science, Social Science, Commerce, etc.) in all schools in that district and English or other foreign languages should be taught as languages only. Having English as a medium of instruction in many schools is the main reason that basic concepts of many students are weak just because they are not able to understand concepts explained in English.
0 0 Sir, Many times we find the Human rights activists making noise in support of a terrorist. But, I dont understand how a terrorist be considered a human being. A person plants a bomb, fires indiscriminately, kills innocents  and still we provide him human rights - i cant digest. the act is totally inhuman. Akhshamya Apraadh h ye , isme daya nahi dand hona chahiye wo bhi aisa ki karne wale ke man me khauf ho aur wo apraadh karne se pahle 2 baar soche.
0 0 This not only violation of law of the land but is completely against the human values and basic human rights. We have heard several activists talking of human rights of criminals and fighting for them but what about the victims and law enforcement agencies like police. I am not against the principle of natural justice but a big supporter of the justice for all....... A balanced approached is required besides public awareness...
0 0 police should be given free hand to combat the menace. They should identify the persons and nab them before they commit the offence. It is normally only after something happens, the police react. The police should try to nab the culprits even before the offence is committed. It so happens that even though police know who are the persons generally involving in such acts, yet they will not nab them until they commit the offence. higher vigilance should be maintained to curb the menace.
1 0 Government should put a strict ban on any kind of porn online or in form of CD/DVD and strict punishment for watching such websites or CDs just like around many countries of world (South Korea, UAE, Saudi Arabia etc.). This shall help fight crime against women in a big way and help human trafficking.
0 0 Govt gives many ads to stop drinking in movies and theatres. But had it done any good to save  lives or medical help of those who got addicted. I think 1) Allow only drinks less than 10% alcohol in shops and bars. Star(3+) hotels and rich pubs to offer all - as upper middle class and rich come there; have personal insurance to take care. 2) Levy health tax for liquor sold in wine shops on every bottle with ID card no (Adhaar etc). 3) Health tax levied should be given back as health insurance
0 0 Reduce gold investment objectives - I don't think govt has looked at all perspectives. 1) Only Rich invest in gold or buy heavy jewellery. Lower to middle class citizens buy/exchange only daily ware ornaments usually less than 50K per annum as "Shubh". 2) Only upper middle class to ultra rich may be investing heavily in gold, (some as black money) 2)  Increase VAT on gold retail purchases  to 2%(> 1lac), 3%(> 3lac), 5% (> 5lac), 10% (>10 lac). 3) Interpret historic VAT purchases

The distance ,speed and location of  the vessel/ known or unknown object   crossing   Indian  Coastal  International  Borders  towards  entering  to  India.5.Photograph of the vessel in all dimensions including all inside.

1 0 i want to focus govt on e-gov projects and sharing my experience . Unless the back end integration of systems take place, the front end efforts may not lead to any success. The integration of various departments, supporting applications and databases is must for true front office results,so Creating front offices without any back office integration is another cause of e-governance failure.
1 0 India  should have a single helpline number like 911 to report all the problems so it would enable people to give informations vital to catch people who are incharge of human trafficking . One of the   Largest reasons why people dont give out such information publicly is due to the fact that they are afraid of being exposed . Such a help line would help them speak out in stealth
1 0 As the human wants are endless,immoralities in society of India are endless.There are endless subjects & discussions on offenses,crimes,immoralities in India done by official from peonto officer,common person to VIP,priest to so called sant etc,etc.The time has come to make a preventive checks for all these, that is :-"Ideal Law" or "Noble law" for India.Apart from all laws,this law should be made by people of India for the people of India.Noble Committee has to be set up for this purpose.
0 0 Honourable Prime Minsiter, i would like share my view like below ; The most important thing i have noticed in energy conservation is plight our public roads in our country. The major portion of fuel consumption is wasted due to the bad & very worst condition of our rural as well as urban roads.If roads are well built & properly & timely maintained, we can save fuel consumption to the extent of 50 % which will reduce the bruden on our national ex-chequer. In this regard action is needed urgently.
1 0 My sincere request to Indian Government is that it needs to give the much deserved right of women which has been taken away in the recent past years ie. living with equality and dignity.This can be done only by making them stand next to men at each and every level of society by giving them 50 percent reservation in public and private jobs. This alone can bring a drastic change in the mindset of male dominant society which sees women as its property and is at unease when she goes against his will

0 0 procure only by global tender.  these cement manufacturers have taken india from ride.  Life cycle concrete te road will be better than the bitumen road done improperly
1 0 if nitn katkari can get cement at 125  why ot the res of india ask him to disclose the name of supplier
0 0 you have to fight these maffiars if in8idan can think of economic improve,ent.  My suggetion to eradicate this cement mafia is allow imports  (  people are obstructing in the name of approval from safety department. you can cutdown imports of gold and allow all infrastructure proejcts can direcly source their requirement from abroad.  eventhough the transportation cost is high still import of cement will be cheaper  this action will make the cartel to reduce the prices
1 0 I konw the reason for this: the follwoing maffia net work is exixsting  in 1) sugar and molasses (leader sharath pawar) , cement cortel where the major shares of cement companies are owned by politicians,  drug mafia controlled by terrorists,
1 0 CONCRETE ONLY IN NATIONAL HIGHWAYS A VERY GOOD DECISION  HE Has told that there is a supplier in mumbai to supply 125 rs a cement bag.  if it is so ask him to find out why cement in other parts of india is selling at RS350/   which is an abnormal price

They usually go to public places like gardens etc. in the morning & evenings and leave the pets alone , which creates  a scary situation for kids and elderly. This picture can be seen all over India. I am sharing the link.

0 0 Cow slaughter, cow economy, organic farming: US has "A2" milk as brand. Our desi cows are rich in this. Standardize and popularize this. Ban slaughter of only desi cows. This way, it ensures that all communities are happy and the basic premise of cow protection is taken care. Organic farming in taken care.

0 0 GM food: I read recently that govt cleared field trials of GM food. I am skeptical about it. GM food is given the status - "proven innocent until proven guilty". considering the seriousness of implications, this is not correct. But I understand that trials can not go on for 30-40 yrs. Pls do the following: 1. GM labeling: Label the food if it is GM. In US the industry lobby blocked this move. In India, pls ensure that it is labeled. ..continued to next post.
0 0 GM food: continued. 2. Seek detailed test report of all the field trials in the world and put in public domain. 3. Pls guarantee that it does not spread to undesirable farms/plantations. Safe guards to prevent issues, their reliability etc. 4. Pls invest in public debate on the subject. - GM + its pesticides vs. normal with pesticides; 5. How the organic farm next to a GM farm could get affected. 6. ensure that all stakeholders/promoters are fully transparent to people of india.
0 0 Media content classification and regulation: All advanced countries try to regulate/streamline the content because it is the one that shapes the thoughts of the young and old minds alike. Kindly update the classifications, do whatever is necessary to encourage content producers/sellers to create healthy audio-visual content so that country actually can participate in development. Also this is a safety issue. Ex: PG13 rating in US is quite known for its standard.

0 0 Health and Safety is one of the most important topics in developed countries. It requires lots of resources especially finance and human.

This could lead India into a new path walking along with the developed countries and can revolutionise every industry by bringing in new quality to work & life of Indians. Jai Hind

0 0 Human trafficking is worst form of exploitation. It is almost equivalent to slavery. It needs multi-pronged approach to deal with this menace. All the stake holders must be identified and dealt with e.g. traffickers, Police, NGOs and above all the victims. The trafficking prone areas / communities should be identified and dedicated programmes should be initiated to reduce poverty and improve education and awareness among them. The traffickers must be meted out exemplary punishment.

Thank you.
1 0 Poverty is a major factor which allows human trafficking, particularly young girls for prostitution. Close watch needs to be maintained in railway and bus stations and suspects should be questioned by the police in presence of some NGO representative. Education of girl child and creation of gainful job opportunities in the rural areas like food processing and health care sector needs to be speeded up.IPC be suitably amended for more stringent punishment to the offenders by fast track courts.
0 0 1. FIR should be registered for each missing child or girl 2. each FIR should be given unique id no at national level 3. social media (fb , whats app, twitter) should be widely utilised to trace the missing ones 4. a unique web portal can be dedicated for the display of information including photo of the missing ones
0 0 The intensity of the menace in recent years points to need  for character building in initial schooling of children.. Perhaps  reintroduction of    prayers and teachings of  religious biggies  and importance of  character building  coupled with  policy of recruitment  of dedicated  good charactered  teachers on basis of merit instead of quotas and political or money connections might help.That is more important than playing National Anthem in schools at primary stage.

2 0 Government should establish an web portal as well as mobile applications from where one could post their complaints. In major of the cases police is either not accepting the complaints or they harass the victim to withdraw cases because of political influence. To discourage such ridiculous incidents and to fight against human trafficking such technology should be implemented and along with fast track courts at district level should be established for faster justice.

0 0 Such Matters shall be in fast track court and guilty must be punished very soon. Then such case may be stopped effectively
0 0 Human trafficking is increasing because of loopholes in your judiciary and bureaucracy. Police and other enforcement authorities are well aware from where human trafficking is taking place, who are involved and  ho are all the major users. Corrupt elements in our systems degenerates to the greater extent. What is the solution? 1. Very strict punishment for all those involved 2. Constant vigil 3. Encouraging social organisation to create awareness 4. Livelihood opportunities in the problem areas
0 0 1) Less avenue for job and employment opportunity leads to Human Trafficking, 2) Failed law and order is second problem, 3) If we successfully provide jobs in our own cities and towns, human trafficking happening in metro cities could be checked, 4) Uneducated girls are caught in the business of prostitution in cities when they came to search for work, 5) Advertising and media promotion of how to protect oneself from thugs and human traffickers must be started.

Stringent laws against trafficking. 5. awareness among people about human trafficking so that they don't become easy prey of employment agencies. 6. Proper employment registration by govt. bodies
0 0 We have to first see the different types of Human trafficking happening in the society- 1. For Prostitution, for Cheap Labour, For Beggery, for organ trade, for games like children use for camel race. The agencies supplying manpower need to be registered with local government and shall be monitored for their activities. The verification shall be carried out by police. There shall be rules for financial transactions of supply of manpower. 2. There is actually a necessity of legalizing prostitutio
0 0 Equal oppurtunity for all without indescrimonation on basis of political linkage,police qtrocities and corruption free society will definitely help.
0 0 Trafficking mostly happens when Earning differential & lack of opportunity for employment happens in various places. People want to work in places where they can easily get employment & get more salary. Greed on part of job-seekers to earn more & job-givers to save more by hiring illegal people or pay less is cause for activity. Employment at rural areas & small towns will reduce menace. Govt must ensure that exploitation of labor by paying  less is not allowed in towns & cities to curb it.

1 0 There are various ways to fight human trafficking such as involving all the stake holders i.e. the Police, the social organizations, the NGOs, the politicians, the racketeers and above all the victims. There should be strict laws for indulging in human trafficking. The perpetuators should be shamed by disclosing their names publicly apart from imposition of prison term and financial penalty. The victims should be rehabilitated with dignity i.e. their names should not be disclosed.
0 0 first of all find out the red light areas and rehabilitate all of the sex workers. the find out the all beggars near signals and give them job or meal and rehabilitate them to. and caught all the anti socialists who do this type of offense

This Has to be banned. can we start an initiative to stop this. If our government is serious about development , THEN DO This BAN

3 0 Sir, To stop the suicide of the farmers in  Vidarbha, Marathwada, A.P. and many parts of the country, Govt should create a Bank account in the name of "Farmers welfare fund", and should make an Appeal to our citizens to deposit whatever possible amount with no barrier on higher side.

People will gladly contribute to such a fund which can stop suicide of the farmers!

This will help the agencies to focus on their missions. Every fundamental rights of citizens should be protected including their religious rights. The recent religious conversions by some groups are also disturbing. The govt should act indiscriminately against human right encroaches. Govt is for everyone. !
0 0 Narendraji, I have seen how labor is exploited by another senior labor(Incharge) in most of the construction industry. It is like supply of labor. Under your strong leadership people want to invest in India and develop it. As the aspirations of even the most illiterate and so called backward class have risen there is a rush to encash the growth through any means. My suggestion is let there be no growth unless it can be sustained. There must be strict vigil on compensatio paid to even teh labor.

0 0 Vigilance on the borders should be very strict and tight. The officers/ cop on the ground, who are actually verifying document and dealing with the potential victim on day to day basis, should be especially trained to see the unseen facts/ motives. Officers on ground need to be alert and these officers should have access to latest technology, where they can find the list of missing citizens etc, which will help in improving the pace with which our system works.'Wait-time' should be minimized.
0 0 Efficient Cops and Emergency Cells are important sir.. We need Sincere Cops and police officers and as the name itself suggests any susceptible groups should be monitored..

0 0 Dear Modiji, I lived in different countries like USA,UK,MALAYSIA and visited South Korea, Iran and currently Living in UAE. What I have noticed and felt is, there are many people like me and many others we need them to pull to our Indian stores, so that we can expand our  market and inturn their governments will pay us money in Dollars, which is very useful for us. for this we need to construct atleast 2 or 3 Indian stores in big cities in the world where Indians are living most.
0 0 The termination is the cost of raising voice against corruption done by the Director at NIT, Uttarakhand. Can money n power manage everything in India ? Modiji speaks "aac he din aayenge" but When n How ? Who will take action against the corrupt Director ? The system is sleping....
0 0 I was terminated from the post of Assistant Registrar at National Institute of Technology, Uttarakhand during probation consequent upon. Prof. H.T. Thoat, the Director is involve in corruption {amounting to Rs.225 crores (appro.)}, mutilation of students, faculty & staff. A female faculty has already made suicidal attempt due to his behavior. Ten faculty n staff have already resigned during last one year. The staff members had appealed everywhere but no response. Whether system has paralysis....
2 0 Construction workers who are migrants are the most vulnerable lot for Human Right Exploitation. Imagine even the big companies do not want to streamline the process of their  employment and get them register. In the name of training these companies in collusion with NSDC are misusing the training funds. Imagine the sector skill council of construction is headed by a nontechnical person and being a HR person who advises council how to exploit the funds and rights of these construction workers.

0 1 For job creation in country..... we have to establish government industries on large scale for manufacturing of our unique products for the export to most of the countries of the world...... it will create jobs on large scale in different parts of the country and recovers our economic condition.....
0 0 Dear prime Minister, I am regularly watch your feature plan to development of Our India such as MAKE IN INDIA is in international marketing slogans,  neighbor country development at Nepal, Srilanka and SARRC nations etc.... Concentrating  manufacturing sector to improve job creation and this excellent insight.  However Please give more focus on   AGRICULTURAL SECTOR so that next generation will not face food shortage, hence proposing name of slogans : YOUNG AGRI IN INDIA for youngster
1 0 HONORABLE SIR, IN MY OPINION WE MUST TAKE PRADHAN MANTRI DHAN JAN YOJNA TO BOTTOM LINE OF RURAL INDIA THROUGH POST OFFICES SAVING SCHEMES AS BANK’S ARE NOT COVERING LARGE PARTS OF RURAL INDIA. BUT POSTAL DEPARTMENT HAVE LESS COST SYSTEM TO RUN THE MISSION MORE EFFETIVILY. REGARDS NITIN SHARMA
0 0 Identity crisis- the basic cause of social unrest & bad behaviour Fall out: School dropping out, Drug addiction, Unacceptable social behaviour like atrocities towards the females, antinational activities, terrorism, religious fanaticism, intolerance of all kinds, etc. Solution: Integrate family & community, create basic infrastructure, compulsory enrolment in schools, provide meals and shelter, create productive assets/ vocation for livelihood to all, enable children to dream and aspire to grow
2 0 Dear PM, Sir There is no end to drafting new new Plans / Projects, etc  but the most important at the hour is its implementation and monitoring by a selected band of Senior Sincere Officials. May I take the liberty to comment that the slow and steady wins the race. Let us stop here for a while  to any  further proposals and the projects but start bringing  them into practice other than leaving on papers only. We can see the results of the Plans declared so far before we move on further .
0 0 I  am attaching 1. Plan to stop sexual violence against woman. 2.Plan for  a Humanity subject in schools 3.Plan to open bank account in Jan dhan yojna. 4.Plan to  stop drug addiction in Punjab
0 0 sir, this is the most horrific crime that exists. human trafficking effectively means taking away all the rights of the person. the part which is sadder is that the people who are to protect us from this is abetting it for either money or fear of someone high up in the ranks. we can frame laws after laws, but unless and until steps are taken to get the law enforcement agencies and their personnel are made to realize and are compelled to perform their duty and maintain discipline,it goes on :(
0 0 Root cause of AHT, is black money and un-employement. Unethical ways to earn money-momentarily gain something, which can be stopped only by cutting the causes in ROOTS!
1 0 Dear sirs, It is painful that women in our society feel insecure. It our country who have respected women as shakti, but now a days she is taken as most vulnerable object for sexual assault.  We remain as simple watcher and do not raise or react against the rising crime. As a citizen of this country we should not remain as spectators. Every female is responsibility of each of us and put our efforts to protect her dignity and respect. Our police needs to be more active and friendly to women.
1 0 This is most serious matter in our country and we can deal with this by educating people , making strong laws , better coordination of our local Intelligence units and Police , keeping a narrow watch and interrogating beggars and suspicious peoples  , making use of security cameras on the railway stations , roadways stations , busy streets , markets , school and college gates etc . Police & LIU Should regularly do checking in probable means of transportation and hideouts used by the culprits .
2 0 Respected Sir,I would like to co-ordinate topic human trafficking with conflict between the family especially the parents.In the present era one of the most cause is the lack of care towards children.Whatever child learn from their parents especially the violence they see in their home is one of the cause which leads them towards making a kidnapper or rapist etc.It is not just about gender because this is faced by both the gender of children.The need is the morality taught in home to children.
1 0 Respected sir, It is not difficult for the Law to track the Pimps & the unfortunate ones.Entire issue revolves around desire & commitment of law enforcing machinery.If other countries can bring down the rate of sexual crimes against women we certainly can easily do it.95 percent of the women are forced into the trafficking,so the doers must be subjected to similar penalty. I wish our suggestions become rules of tomorrow for the betterment of our country.put senior citizens as a moral police .
0 0 Human trafficking is the most backward face of human and most affected are poor child of both genders.govt is taking many steps,but for this we have to awake human soul.If you could not do anything for them,atleast allow them to live their ordinary life.we all see many children at railway stations and public places.many times we all are culprits because when we need maid,we don't think he/she is a child,we only want our work to be done.we talk much about it,but don't have courage to say no to it
0 0 Respected sir,It is so disturbing to see our children,our women folk getting the worst of treatments & torture.we constantly talk of Terrorism, the people responsible in Human Trafficking are worst than Terrorists for their cruelty on women.unless crime towards women is not given equivalent punishment such exploitation will continue.give death penalties to the proven guilty. Create fast track courts for sorting these cases. Fixing cctv cameras & its proper functioning in Red light areas is must.
0 0 Respected sir, Measures are- (1)Each Indian must be covered with Aadhar card, this will enable us to identify & track each person.(2) The severest punishment should be given to those who pull /lure the victims into trafficking.(3)If a common man knows which are the lousy /Redlight areas of his town/village/city, then why decisive action is not taken?Answer is corruption of money & offer of pleasure given to deciding authorities.(4)It is high time severest of punishment be given to corrupt class.
0 0 My suggestion for the national concern is that the name'INDIA' of our country should be change to 'BHARAT' .the name INDIA still make me feel that I m living under the colonial rule.we are the largest democracy in the world and we are carrying the name of British rule please do a concern to this matter
0 0 Sir, Can your govt legalize prostitution ...the oldest business. This could reduce to a very great extend human trafficking
1 0 Respected sir, Today as we see smoking Is main problem. When we travel in public vehicle to save our energy sources we automatically become passive smokers against our will . sir as we all know cigarette has all harmful chemicals for our respiratory system. If we increase the cost it will not affect the addict as he will purchase at any cost. So respected sir we can change  the harmful ingredients by harmless ingredients to overcome the health problems.  we have to design cigarette in a new way
0 0 Respected sir,  in chhatishgarh  in  dhamtari  city abhi tak bye pass road nahi banaa hai. Dailly  2 days ke ander  mein  bahut  accident  ho raha  hai  so please make road so accident  may be stopped.
0 0 Child trafficking is most cruel thing. It destroys our future generation. Last year we visited India. right outside Kurla Station we saw two kids begging. They were of the same age as my son. It was hurting us. My husband wanted to help them, give them money. But then I said, this money will not actually reach them. So at that time we gave tthem vada pav to eat. This is not a solution either. but that is all we could do at that time. I really want to help but my contribution will not be much.
0 0 I just want one thing from you sir, and I'm begging for it, please ban the pornography websites in INDIA, because of this our youth is destroyed and the process is continued, this is a video that has raised some of the harms that we can stop if we ban pornography sites in INDIA. plz plz plz ................... upto infinity https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRJ_QfP2mhU
0 0 At the time we are able to stop new entries to this business and reduce demand for this business, it is possible to solve this problem.
1 0 as compared to 30 years before to either gender.As regard to Gay it is also old but it should not be legalised.Gay marriage should not be permitted but if two male live togehr they may pass their life un attentive by society or Govt.This community is almost negligible in our country and no importance should be paid to them ie neither any harrasment nor any encouragement. Regards
0 0 Honble PM It is the oldest profession in the world and it cant be removed ,eradicated or suppresd.In my view  it should be regularised legally so that some betterment of sex workers.Though in adance contries also as USA  Italy Las Vegas the conditions are horrible.In any category of hotels if customer has taken or arranged any girl they should not be raided.For health of Nation such workers should have regular checkup so that disease are not spread as today.Now a days life is more lonely compare
0 1 Clean India movement does not fully success until Government will arrange shelters to strolling animals.These Strolling Animals defecate in Public Places like Bus Stand etc thus taint stretched.
1 0 On every railway station we see small children begging and all.Railway station has govt gazzetted officers available police available and thousand of people travelling.but nobody cares.these are children most vulnerable for trafficking.lets us solve this.all knows passer by cannot take children with them.let us every school(private and public) have free seats available for unowed children.let every police station have place for these children to eat.town can contribute for expense of food.
0 0 This is not related to human trafficking. But I do not find a suitable place to record this. It is a very good move from the Govt to abolish treating suicidal attempt as an offence. What the individual requires is compassion and councelling and not punishment. I request Govt not to treat Balck Flag demonstrations / effigy burning as an offence and give chance to people for this peaceful form of protests. In many places we find policemen pitifully trying to douse the effigy fire.
0 0 Child Labour, Unemployment for youths & un education are the basic factors for human trafficking. We need to understand these factors in micro-level then only we can fight with it.
0 0 Ban child labour in India. Pass the pending bill in Parliament.This will solve half of human trafficking
0 0 Sir, This suggestion is for Maharashtra state govt.There is road between two industries:Premium Transmissions and Wilo Mather Platt at Akurdi in Pimpri Chinchwad area. This road needs urgent repairs. The road is only 150 meters in length. If this road improves it will help industries and employees, suppliers, customers etc.Please look into this suggestion.
0 0 beggers in india should be Banned & especially child begging, Gov should make places in association with NGOS where these beggars can be kept providing food & shelter along with involving them in some productive work of small scale industries at the same time teaching & training  of children in some skill job
0 0 in gujarat number of school have no toilet facility. like in gujarat gandhinagar borisana village school. plese give grant for boys and girls toilet

0 0 respected sir some of the bank staff not support for jandhan yojana. he is not intrested to open free account in bank
0 0 I am deeply concerned with the foolishness of our intelligence and security agencies.Why they should reveal every details on how they caught the terrorists and the information received from arrested terrorists to media? I was shocked to see a program on IBN7 where they revealed details of plan by RAW to kill Dawood on 13-09-2013 while he would be going to mess.They revealed that Mossad helped in training 9 RAW agents and tracking Dawood. Now terrorists are avoiding CCTV,Mobile mail etc.
1 0 Human trafficking is the worst form of bane for human society. It is the worst form of smuggling as per natural law. The govt. machinery has to be over alert so as to curb this. Apart from that ways to rehabilitate the bane is also needed on a very extensive and large scale.In order to rehabilitate the wrong practice there needs to be certain other important measures to be giving them some alternative or the other to provide ways and means to give them an alternative to lead a good life, ready.
0 0 Human Trafficking is a crime and a human rights violation. For a situation to be one of trafficking three distinct elements (act, means, purpose) must be fulfilled: The ACT of recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons must be done by A MEANS such as the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or the giving or receiving of payments and it must be for the purpose of EXPLOITATION i
1 0 The Anti-Human Trafficking for Criminal Justice is the result of a global process in which expert representatives, NGOs,global organizations, law officers, prosecutors and judges from all over the world contribute their expertise and good practices. In line with the Trafficking in Persons, the UNO Crime Convention, the purpose of the Anti-Human Trafficking Manual for Criminal Justice Practices has initiated various steps in implementing the policies which will not only curb this bane for normal
1 0 To curb crime specially against women and identifying uber cab driver kind of persons.Whenever any person arrested or convicted for any crime his biometric data must be taken and linked to aadhaar.Create an independent agency other than police to keep this record and while recruitment by any government or private company  record must be checked. And for particular offence,  some jobs are to be denied.It will definitely reduce crime and will create jobs also.
0 0 The job of taking down FIRs should be handed to some other department/group rather than police. This will reduce the cases where police refuse to register FIR for any crime. Person taking down FIR does not need to have the skills of a policeman, they only need skills of documenting and honesty to note down the complaint.
0 0 Their should be a very tough  & Technical work needed along the india-bangladesh border to ensure that no bangladeshi refugees can enter india illegally.
0 0 This industry grow due to the lack of moral and encouraging factors in the society. It needs a treatment at the root level of our society.
2 1 NATION IS RUN BY THE TAX COLLECTED - TAX PAYERS ARE NOT APPRECIATED The Highest tax payers in each sector should be greeted and appreciated by gov. They don't want price money - just a certificate is enough. all the highest tax payers in different sectors can be given a place in independence day or republic day parade - corporates will competite for paying taxes.
0 0 Flipkart makes the Chinese economy stronger by selling their smartphones, why can't they make Indian economy stronger by promoting the products of cottage industry...
0 0 Sir could you please research on Why Chinese smart phones are not sold in Israel and ban it accordingly in India...
0 0 Agriculture Development & Suicide of Former: I wish government of India needs concentrate more on this sector giving priority to affected areas Vidhabha etc. Every State shall be made responsible use agriculture college, CSIR and Agriculture bodies shall joint hand to help former in scientific way. 1. Soil Testing 2. Advice on type of cultivation. 3. Free seeds for cultivation. 4. Free Organic/ Fertilizer. 5. Finance and Market 6. Govt Tractor & tools 7. Export possibility only if excess.
0 0 THE MSG IS FOR EXP. CONTROL COMMISSION - GIVE GOVT. SUBSIDIES FOR REALLY SUFFERING UNITS / COS AND NOT TO PROMOTERS / COS. WHO ARE HAVING HIGH NETWORTH. TODAY, POOR MEN AND WOMEN ARE SUFFERING IN THE GAS AGENCIES AND BANKS FOR UPDATION OF BANK A/CS DUE TO NON-AVALIABILITY OF ADHAAR CARD. WHEREAS BANKS AND GAS AGENCIES ARE NOT UPDATING. CORPORATIONS ARE NOT GIVING ADHAAR FORMS. THE GOVT. IS TARGETING AND MAKES POOR PEOPLE SUFFER FOR SUBSIDIES. PM SHRI MODI SHOULD ATTEND IMMEDIATELY THIS PROB.
1 0 In Kanyakumari, Kerala there are many Homes for Children doing child Trafficking from northern regions, Police doing nothing on them, if issues raise, they just move kids to govt houses, but still there owners of Children homes are left untouched, because of religion issues. They are getting money from foreign countries, so to get more money and doing conversion, they doing child Trafficking. If you really think it is against humanity Please do action.
0 0 Each and every land deal happening in India has to be strictly monitored and to be assigned with a property registration number. That property registration number could also be included in the site address and it could be used to identify the authenticity of the land.The assigning of Property Registration Number should be made completely online from Request placing to submission of documents online in scanned format to generation of registration number. Missionaries land should also be included.
0 0 Please give contract to online retail giants like snapdeal.com, flipkart.com to promote that cottage industry products online line Indian artifacts, embroideries, sambalpuri sarees, clay artifacts etc. that will boost the income of Indian cottage industries through remarkable increase in sell.
0 0 In every foreign deal, the foreign interests must be clearly defined and restricted. In case we are purchasing any weapon or technology we must learn from it and work hard to reduce dependency in future.
0 0 It is not a hard and fast rule that to destroy a fighter plane we must have a fighter plane. We must work on devices that could dismantle the entire communication system of a fighter plane through creating waves or on mobile ground-to-air missile technology in order to improve its accuracy. If we can achieve the mars mission in a cheapest possible way, then we definitely can win the biggest ever war in the cheapest possible way. Strategic and tactical warfare needs research and implementation.
0 0 On Jan 26, Obama is coming to India, Please refrain from making any aircraft deals with that nations, because they can sell the fighter planes to us but they will keep the key of Kill switch with themselves. Instead you can choose to make a deal of mechanical weapons with them like Assault rifles, highly upgraded machine guns etc.
0 0 Let's start to make money on the foreign lands in order to improve the Indian economy. The first step should be through our services like online Marketing portal, Indian online education portal, promoting Ayurveda business all across the globe in order to improve the economic prosperity of India. Such things are much needed in underdeveloped nations like Fiji, Rwanda, Nigeria etc.
0 2 Please make a restriction in India that each and every payment above INR 1000 should be through Credit Card or Debit Card. In order to have a proper monitoring of the overall national accounting.
0 0 In order to have an idea of what sort of online professional certification could be offered through education  portal developed by India, please refer vskills.in.We can also use this to promote Hinduism across the globe by promoting our ethics and culture..
0 0 Sir, please initiate to make our online education portal just like or more well equipped then coursera.org. Through this portal, we must promote Indian education, sanskrit and all sorts of courses throughout India as well as in most of the developing nations or under developing nations. Our education will reduce the US dominance and improve their quality of life. Also, through this widespread education portal across the globe as well as India will improve the Indian economy. For ex: coursera.org
0 0 E-Marketing is the future of commercial industries. To promote this the first step is to strictly regulate  the NASSCOM and the IT firms that are operating in India. We must give them contract to start their online web-marketing portal and take its patent rights. We must promote the Indian web marketing services across the globe that can create wealth and curb out the issue of Trade deficit. This will contribute significantly on India's annual growth rate.

1 0 Sir, for this issue please give more focus on the poor states like Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar and orrisa. One can easily find people from these state in metro city doing domestic work and most of them are below 18. Public authority should established helping center in Railways station and railway police need to be more active to stop human trafficking. Also, placement agencies needs scrutiny.
0 0 Human beings are trafficked in various facets - maidservants, unskilled/skilled labour, prostitution, emigration, slavery etc.  Fake orphanages get foreign aid & keep so-called orphans who are used as slave labour. Traffickers lure women as maidservants & then betray them by forcing them into prostitution or sex-slaves. Rampant emigrant trafficking exists in which people migrate illegally due to better livelihood in European/American countries. ALL TYPES EXPLOITATIVE, WRONG & HAS TO BE STOPPED!
0 0 We should have better punishments , thats why many people are involved in crime .Police should be strict , there should be no corruption  with the people who protect our laws. JAI HIND
0 0 There should be a number like the police 100 that can be used by people/kids kidnapped.People involved should be given capital punishments. Newspapers should regularly publish such numbers , to create awareness. Citizen groups should be formed at every Taluk level to inform suspicious activities to police.
0 0 hello sir please do changes in rape teasing and molestation articles
1 0 The police of each area should be always alert. They should have better awareness. If they see a child begging or doing labour they should know what steps have to be taken. Similarly citizens also should be made aware
2 0 PULL UP POLICE.
0 0 Dear PM Sir, Please change the article for rapists penalty from investigation to direct shoot on him at middle street / road. By doing this the people will afraid about the punishment.
0 0 Mr. PM, the govt. should tie up with different NGOs which work against the human trafficking and also keep a check by cross checking on the NGOs through regular surprises. By this the man power required by the govt. will surely decrease and it will be more organised. Prostitution should not be legalized at any point and instead there should be programs through which people should indulge in sex only with their beloved (wife).
0 0 First legalize prostitution. Give each prostitute an ID. Locate them in specific area. Track all of them. Seek deceleration from each new comer and do counselling. Make education up to class 10 compulsory for each girl child. Locate all who leaves education and make counselling.
1 0 Dear PM , the need of the hour is to bring out a strong law in India against the rapists. Death penalty , castration, life imprisonment . its has to be strong enough to protect the woman in our nation. This is the most important issue in our country otherwise all your policies , efforts taken to better this nation are of no use.For the protection of mother , sisters and daughters kindly take necessary action .You are the PM of nation and with that responsibility you can bring this change.
0 0 All villages and panchayath offices are to be connected on line and online payment system to be introduced. some villages and panchayaths are more than 30 km or so. it makes difficulties to make payments and loss of revenue to the government. and due to be recovered as per plan. not after years.
0 0 Police register and take action on midsing reports only after 24 hrs during which an abducted person can be taken to another state also. In case of woman,girl or child missing case, police must immediately take fir and act accordingly and must not wait for 24 hrs, some cases may not be of human traffic but it will demoralise the criminal
1 0 Sir pls create centralise policing unit     which connected to all state police all data r online for each state.state create his police hitec all complaint registered online all thana under central cctv survilance online.while data shared.it helps people & police as well center can watch condition of police making policy for jawan & station.just like we out polio from country we improve policing through digital ways & remove criminals from india.sir it makes larger effect on corruption.
0 0 Dear Prime minister, i want to bring to your notice an issue that relates to connectivity with Northeast. You must be aware that only few(4-5) trains are plying enroute Northeast. Even it is very difficult to book ticket via Tatkal. The airfare towards this particular region is also very high (today 52000/- tmrw 37000/- for guwahati) . In case of emergency how would a common man like me travel. My humble request is in regions where rail connectivity is not good,  airfare should be reasonable.
2 0 Sir, First of all, Band the Porn Indusry in India and Save around 30000 cores rupees black Money. By the Principle of Management, "If Demand is more the Supply is More." If you band the porn industry, may demand decreases. Also rape also decreases. Hopefully you will save the backbone of India i.e. Spirtual Heritage and Also save the all Dharma.( Hindu, Islam, Buddha, Jain. Sindhi etc.) Plz Full band on Porn Industy.

0 0 Dear Prime Minister, When an Indian flies in our out of the country, why does he need to fill in a slip which is a waste of time for traveler as well as officials; all that is needed by immigration is the passport - the details of which are already pre-fed & available in the system. Travel details of passenger are available with airlines, the two systems could be interlinked in real time to save time for all. Thanks
0 0 Dear Prime Minister, To stop harassment to travelling public + officials on duty at airports, please abolish customs duty on everything brought in by passengers except for drugs, weapons, other dangerous/socially dangerous products..it will free up our airports & make them comparable with efficient & customer friendly airports like Dubai. Thx
0 0 Sir, I have posted many suggestions yesterday covering multiple areas; but in error have posted them on whatever page was open when I first logged in , I did not post on the open forum unfortunately. Will my suggestions still reach the Prime Minister since they concern multiple ministries & need prime ministerial sanction/weight. thx
1 0 Human Trafficking, in the words of Mr. Kailash Satyarti, is a multi-billion dollar business, and in this business world mafia is involved.  Law alone cannot address this problem.  We need willing participation of every member of the family.  We have to infuse in them the advantage of following our traditional value system in a more scientific and accepted way.  First, every individual should look within, & support his family around, bring them into the fold of embedded traditional value system.
3 0 Organ theft and sex market is the main force behind human trafficking. So monitor private hospitals and other medical centers where all these illegal activities takes place.
2 0 Every railway station and bus stand and public place should be under servilance of CC T V Cameras. Some nomad people with family residing near there should be rehabilitated and bring to main stream of the society to stop human trafficking.
1 0 Dear Sir,  Since I didn't find a separate forum on Marriage laws in India, I have chosen to write about it here. We want to bring to yout notice about outdated marriage laws that are heavily skewed towards women.I would really request you to please review your goverment's idea of passing Irretrievable breakdown of marriage laws. Please create a forum & then gather data on the same. Perhaps, many harassed husbands will get a stage to appeal to you.
1 0 Sir u started with swach bharat abhiyan...we r indians sir...hume dare bina aadat nhi kaam krne ki....Plz impose a fine on people who is seen polluting the environment or littering on the roads. Only this can work rather than persuasion
0 0 Jaa krde case. because he doesn't fears from law because he knows in india case will be taking too much time to settle down
3 0 In families where wife is working, the house gets 2.5 lakh+2.50 lakh i.e Rs 5 lakh tax free income.Whereas where only husband is working and wife is housewife, then that house gets only Rs 2.50 lakh tax free income and income above that is taxed.This is unjust.Hence request Govt to give justice

0 1 Women are best at keeping their broods intact and safe. They need decent houses with courtyards to carry out their day to day activities, to keep their family safe and secure far from the prying eyes who are trying to entice family members. This 'housing' for women only will empower her to resist trafficking of any sort and she need not fear being thrown out of house or place of her living, that she has known and others know too. Housing means safety and security which has to be providedToWomen.

Recoveries must be made from such officials in case of such defaulters.

It is better if local shop owners, local residents are given responsibility of penalizing cleaner as well as Sanitary Inspectors in charge of the area if toilets are not maintained. Jai Hind.

0 0 Heard about the AHT website (www.stophumantrafficking/mha.nic.in) for the first time. Unless the department interacts with common people nobody would know about it. Such departments should market themselves by placing advertisements through social media, channels, apps, SMS campaign. The stories on human trafficking should be told to public through TV programmes and sponsored by the AHT department. The good work done by people should be brought to the forefront be it police officers be it public

1 0 To visualise Incredible India, the PM Modiji should first of all with immediate effect to ban begging in India & should be declared as prohibited. To achieve this the disabled beggers who can not earn by hard work should be pooled & sent to the rehabilitation centers and the wilful beggers should be caught and be forced to work like the prisoners in the jail work in some actvity of mfg. and earn their bread. To achieve this goal, only three months time to be given with wide publicity.
