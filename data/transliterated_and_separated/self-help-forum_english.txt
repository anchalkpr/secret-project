The great infra,road,digital and paperless governance etc. by which the pollution level at Delhi will decrease and new place will be pollution free in all aspects.

6 0 Presently physically disabled people booking tickets are not getting lower berths sometimes.Co passengers doesn't co operate or come forward to swap their seats to help a physically disabled passenger.While booking train tickets there should be an option to allot lower berth automatically by the computer.Even in AC Chair Car those who cannot travel without an escort must be given the next seat.I had bitter experience in this regard.Hope Railway Ministry will consider this suggestion.Thanks.

5 0 Dear Sri Modi Ji, Many talented youngsters across various fields are not able to find a right platform to show their skills.Government must encourage them by giving needed support.

1 1 A SUGGESTION ON LPG SUBSIDY Sir,the recent step of cancelling the LPG subsidy of people earning above 10 lakh is welcome. But acc to me,people earning above 6 lakh should be completey barred from subsidy.What's the point in giving Rs 200 a month for LPG as subsidy (for 1 cylinder a month) to people already earning Rs 50,000 a month. THUS THE GOVT. WILL SAVE MORE THAN 200 CRORE.
1 0 Dear PM, My suggestions for income tax in the next budget:- 01. Reduce the age limit to 75 years to be qualified as super senior citizen and increase the exemption to Rs.7.5 lacs from 6 lakhs. 02. Increase senior citizen (60 to 75 years) limit to Rs.500,000 03. Increase general category limit to Rs.350,000 04. Revise slabs as (1)Rs. 3.5 to 7 lakhs 10%, 7 to 15 lacs 20%, above 15 lakhs 30%.

0 0 We often travel from Mumbai to Umbergaon and sometimes to Ahmedabad maximum time by car we pay toll at 7 Places can we have a system for online payment for all the toll at http://www.nhtis.org/map.htm# or can we have a system to get single slip for mumbai to ahmedabad for all the tolls coming in between irrespective of collection companies I think we save paper, ink, Fuel, & Time.

1 0 Contd.. Electricity – Public need to be made partner in producing the Electricity. Make use of roofs of all building to generate solar power. Local electricity board to buy this electricity and offset it with the bill. We have huge potential here. Buildings will also benefit as most of the leakage issues will also be addressed.
1 0 Contd.. Milk–Need one more White Revolution across country. Encourage farmers and underprivileged households to have cows/buffaloes. Pay them for milk and the cow dung. Cow dung can be used to manufacture fertilizers. This way we can make these live stocks useful for people even after their milk producing period, and get constant supply of fertilizers. Will also lead to manufacturing of milk products at local level leading to employment opportunities. These schemes can be linked to MNREGA

1 0 One suggestion for railways: For every fast or super fast train there should be a chair car bogie for short distance(time- 5-6hrs) traveler. So that they should not occupy sleeper class. In this way we can increase the seats of train as well as comfortable for long distance traveler. Thanks Deepan
0 0 Government can utilise the service of unemployed youths with no qualification. They can be given formal training.They can be given tasks to clean water bodies like lakes, ponds,temple tanks and wells where unwanted plants and creepers are grown.By doing this they can earn some amount and also will not remain idle.They must be given with an identity card.With that they do any work as per their talent.
1 0 MP Salary Bill is in discussion. This is the time we make the salary of MPs performance based. The criteria could be the percentage of MPLAD funds used, or the money saved while using allowances, etc. Seventh pay commission also Recommended Performance-Based Increment for Government employees. This way Parliament can lead by example.

0 0 As part of development of Andhra pradesh,I would request Government to not to place IT sector at near to forest and temples.There are more chances for illegal things if IT sector at near forest like vishakapattanam.There are more chances to lost Sanctity and holy of the temple places and it would be costly for piligrims to go to temples like tirupati if IT sector places at near temple place.
0 0 We Indians with low income find hard to live.To keep us living govt hospitals,govt PDS,govt bus,trains,schools is vital.But due to poor mgmt people does not getting from govt benefits.Instead of govt operating them allow private to undertake,run them,all staffs are private persons,They work hard to give good standards.Govt should form set of rules & procedure & use Think tank to evolve this process for success.Private can easily questioned,on going away from standards they can be fined easily
0 0 When buying soap,oils,medicines,groceries,soft drinks is a big headache.People need to search for price,expiry date,manufacture date by keep on rotating the product. Some are in little fonts unable to read properly,some times price will be in one place,manufacturing date will be in one place,expiry date will be in another place. Bring standards,all details in bold & printed next to the name of the products with white background. On Failure bring LAW for customer to reach consumer court for fine.
0 0 I would request Government to increase school and hospitals by getting donations from people and put their names on the name-plates of the building.
0 0 Set up anticipation teams to review all possible natural & man made disasters in each states,then clearly form road maps to take preventive steps in all occasions. Provide full rights to this team to  review all Events causing large level causalities & property damages in all states & publish their review publicly. So the national team can soon get expertise  & can act before too late.
0 0 As part of swach Bharat,i would request Government to mandate toilets in hotels which have seating capacity more than 30.I have seen many hotels with 50 seating capacity and without toilet both in town and city.
0 0 During disaster,to keep supplies reaching public all the times,govt should setup facility along with private production companies all over India.Since food industry & water bottle manufacturing facility around India running by private companies,govt should have tie up to purchase from them & supply where it needed. Also allow to build helipads in company per-misses to transmit during calamities by govt funding.Provide incentives to join in natural relief measures, & rescue,supply missions.
0 0 Many people have been moving to abroad because quality education is free, pension and others. I would request Government to increase CBSE schools in our country.
0 0 Govt should bring law to convert all mobile towers to work with VIA SATELLITE facility 24/7. With solar panels around tower,fuel back up,small wind turbine to power them.Mobile communication should be automated, without human interference able to work even in disasters.Battery provide power for 3 days & recharged using solar & wind.Company should  do trail run every month  to test to work 24/7 without human help.Unless towers are physically destroyed they should  work continuously in disasters.
0 0 Helicopters dropping food in flood affected area find difficult to drop exactly to person hand in rescue operations,often they need to fly lower & risk themselves.Tall buildup area is difficult.They can use on board drones to drop supplies & rescue. DRDO should develop plastic pipes which bend freely & work as lizard tails,which cut of when too much strain on them. So helicopters can use these types of low cost pipes to drop supplies precisely to human hand from higher distance without risk
0 0 We have 200 to 300 MLAs for each state to rule people belongs to certain area.Would not we require CBSC school and hospitals for the same amount of population.I would request Government to increase CBSC schools and Government hospitals.
0 0 DRDO should produce battery with capacity up to 5 days, low cost inflatable plastic boat with small hand pump to inflate boat, produce floating jackets & life saving balloons with hand pumps.Develop small kit to produce pure water using both batteries & natural sun,by converting rain water or salt water into drinkable pure water. These type of kits available in abroad,but at very expensive prices for us,but cheap for them,DRDO should take steps to produce at rs 100 & set up production facility.
0 0 We need rescue teams in all districts.Each with storage & production facility to produce 3 lac foods 3 times a day for up to 10 days.Each should have helipads also.All should be automated so less than 4 members can produce food.Local people must also trained to  use the facility.Produce meal maker based vegetable biriyani &water pocket,biscuit & milk. Keep storage of dried vegetables,milk powder,rice,produce water using solar powered pumps. Keep fuel for both helicopter and other as backup.
0 0 I would request Government to encourage cinema actors and fans group to encourage their fans to construct toilets at crowded areas like markets, hospitals and small heavy crowded railway stations.I would request Government to mandate toilets at shopping areas.
0 0 Many Government officers and politicians have been giving money for interest at 5 to 20 rupees interest per 100 rupees.I would request Government to take necessary actions on this.
0 0 I would request Government to have an audit on natural resources in our country.
0 0 There are many colleges have been constructed at lower ground level or in ponds and those are getting merged one or two floors during rainy season.Those colleges applied for University and deemed university so that those get benefits from Government.I would request Government to not to provide permission for such institutes and industries.
0 0 There is lot of black money transaction have been happening.Government spend lot of money to print currency.I would request Government or RBI or court to reduce expenses on printing and black money transaction by ensuring the bank transactions id in each illegal or legal documents for each money transaction which exceeds 5 or 10 LAKHS.
0 0 Farmers have been getting suicide because lack of water and power.There would be lot of resources and money wastage while transmitting from generation point to towns and cities.Buildings like apartment,hospital,college,hotel,IT parks and etc have empty terrace,it would be very useful to have solar power and rain water harvesting.I would request Government ensure solar power,rain water harvesting and recycling other resources in town and cities to have resources to our next generations.

1 0 Sir Jis tarah kisi bhi job me educational qualification compulsory hota hai Usi tara politics me bhi educational qualification hona chahiye . For example: Bank po post ke liye apply karne ke liye graduation compulsory hai. Thik usi tarah political career join karne ke liye candidate ke paas ek educational qualification honi chahiye like kam se kam graduation to hona chahiye candidate k paas.
0 0 Skill Development for particular jobs - I would like to suggest that there should be government agencies everywhere where there should be one on one help towards seeking job opportunity or Skill development.  Once the individual gets a job which he is interested in, the agency duty is over.  Every individual should be given opportunity to prove their talent and skill.  This way everybody will be happy and crimes can be reduced too.

I would like to appreciate your hard work. 2.Could you please ask everyone in BJP(such as MLA's, MP's etc) not to give any comments about A particular community(such as against shah rukh khan etc). This will create bad image about BJP or your govt. I mean to say all BJP party men should resist from giving any hate speech/comments about a particular community.
1 0 Sir, Appreciate to initiate discussion on 'Duty'. since leaders avoid this. Sir, I have suggestion on budget as new practice - Please start visiting cities , villages before Annual & railway Budget so this process can become mutual.this could be like budget charcha. people can discuss with you as well as they will understand the practical problems of the government. this will make budget more transparent and open. It will definitely help people, government and you. Regards
0 0 #MyGov, sir, Pollution in Delhi is a serious issue, I have learned from NEWS reports that a major contributor to delhi's Air pollution and traffic problems are Trucks passing through Delhi. every city has Key Entry and exit points. such points which are connected by railway lines, trains can pickup and drop such trucks passing by delhi. i have seen this practice in Konkan Railways.
0 0 #SwachBharathAbhiyan Namste Pradhanmantri Ji, To make Swach Bharath Abhiyaan more effective,can we ban the usage of plastic/PolyBag? The Major problem behind jam of drainage system,is usage of Polybage. Can this govt impose a  law against usage of Poly bags? If a state govt bans the usage of poly bags,it remains for a certain time. After some time No audits comes to check , and shopkeepers start usage of this.Sir,Please think in this matter if it could be happen. Regards, Sumnesh
0 0 My views about the duty: Our country being source of spirituality, have enough scriptures talking about duty. Focus on action and be ready to face the result either expected or otherwise. More than understanding from scriptures, we have enough examples from our life. My sons Mridangam Guru is a blind by Birth, retired AIR artist. At the age of 60 plus, learnt to operate touch mobile, laptop,learning veena and trying to teach young students.Our servant maid at 60 very regular&highly dedicated
0 0 Suraaj,a good concept of governance.reality is quite different in our country.the work culture in most of the government departments is not public friendly.unless it is changed,suraaj can't become a reality.
1 0 Nameste Modi Ji, We all knew that you are aware on expenditure related to MP's. Government spends Rs 2.7 Lakhs a month per MP. India paid Rs.176 crore to its 543 Lok Sabha members in salaries and expenses over the last year. Apart from this, MP are getting subsidy on Food in Parliament Canteen. Why are Govt. providing subsidy to our MP's for food? I know this has been since 1947 but as you doing so well, I have full trust on you to eliminate and show to the people of your action.

0 0 Wato increase GDP : Reduce working hours to 6 hrs/day. Now,people spend 12 hrs on the job.8 hrs(@ work) + 2 hrs ( journey ) + 2 hrs ( pre & post work)+ 9 hrs (at home) = 21 hrs.Remaining = 3 hrs = wasted.If work timings are reduced to 6 hrs then 2 hrs will be added which will be = 5 hrs =saved.For banks and other customer service orgs make it 9am - 5pm.They will spend more time on outing ,spending, double jobs , tourism , starting new business thus encouraging start-up culture and productivty.
0 0 Dear Modiji.Gov. is trying all possible way for  material progress of the country and people. Nothing is done to eradicate sorrow of the people. this can be done only by scientific knowledge impacted to the people. I a retired engineer have done years of spiritual  research and can help.Please give  me a chance to serve the people and country.
0 0 Dear  Mr Mddiji. You have shown your spiritual strength and egolessnes by visit to Pak. Please apply this to soniagandhi and opposition.Though it is not needed, you can address parliament often for sometime on various unnecessary issues raised by  congress to stall parliament.Only by spiritual way you can win over  opposition. Criticizing congress for their past work to justify BJP's work will not do . Let your spoke persons not do that .

0 0 MyGov should not go ahead with the plan to raise MP's salary to 2.8 lac. Nobody gets such hefty raise. People are not satisfied with their performance at parliament. India which has 30% people below poverty line cannot afford to pamper their crorepati MPs with such a lavish gift. People who work hard at offices, factories and BPOs don't get even 10% raise. Then how can our irresponsible MPs ask for more than 100% increase? More money won't make our MPs efficient and responsible.

For Ex: An average house in village will not need more than 5000 KW pwr everyday considering 10 people each. This will need 25 solarpanels of 200 W pwr costing 18000 each which will be 4,50,000 Rs. Considering a village of 10000 people will need 20 - 40 Crores of Solar panels to make village electroindependent.

1 0 my views on Traffic Jam Problems in all Indian cities with our Prime Minister...

This is very helpful as it will help to absorb more water during rainy seasons into the grounds especially in rainshadow areas or draught situations. Can we adopt it in India (subject to cost n other factors)?
0 0 Divesting PSUs which are not producing adequate returns of taxed capital of public is even more essential as GST is more  a tax on public as a direct taxes.If the divestment with land and buildings at current value is done and open global tender invited--with security checks--may enable reduction of taxes on people and reskilling more people

1 0 I don't understand why Kolkata Municipality allow encroachment of pavement/footpath by shopkeepers who put up beches, chairs for customers, display their saleable commodities like fan furniture, Coca-Cola crates, flexi signboards, parked motor cycles. Both KMC inspectors and Police are indifferent to  pedestrians' right to walk safely on footpath.  WHY IS CIVIC ADMINISTRATION SO CALLOUS? Politicians do nothing beyond getting votes. No service, no commitment.
1 0 Respected Prime minister Modiji, Happy to see a corruption free and hard working government in operation. But still corruption and red tape continues in government offices. To cut this down I suggest cameras being installed in all the government offices and the video record maintained in central place through network transfer. This will greatly help to monitor and review how a citizen is treated in government offices. If citizen complains the video will act as evidence for govt to take action.
2 0 TRAI differancial prise by service provider, I want to suggest that, any price taken lower than specified should be accepted,but, there should be restriction of any additional or hidden charges by way of scheme or for any additional benefit provided to customer. so, that, service provider can expand the network by competition, which will be benifited to the customer for lower price of services, and also to service provider for getting large and mass market at lower margin go nutralise profit.
