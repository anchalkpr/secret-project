4 1 Respected Sir, being work in Dairy sector some points has to be notice 1- all Dairy industry those are procuring milk from farmers they should release farmers milk payment in their account. subsidy has been closed those are not purchasing milk from farmers and payment in farmers account. 3- audit of the dairy account start from the purchase from the farmers at village level rather then commission agent sent the Dairy Doc/plant.

8 4 Please note , in name of travel & tourism, Ma Ganga's sanctity is being planned to destroy by playing with the belief,devotion of crores of Hindus by Uttarakhand govt who is making tourism spot on MaGanga with floating non veg restaurant-bar for non hindu foreigners! Its a insult to central govt initiative of 'Namami Ganga'! please note that Uttarakhand area of Ma Ganga is coming in its source area, So, if its sanctity is not conserved, what is the use of rest area to conserve! please stop this!
3 1 Why this permission for such huge gold imports into India. It promotes black money, and enriches no one but some jewelers. Also, worsens trade deficit like for March 2015. It is a waste of money for this country, besides promoting black money in the economy.
5 0 Just read in Monday 20th April newspapers that the Babus (IAS etc) have given themselves a huge gift...Now, they do not have to report on gifts received upto Rs. 5000. This is blatant corruption and cheating. I have works in large corporates across many countries incl India and the max gift allowed is upto 2500. And beyond that, you have to file a gift received report to the COmpliance Office. In foreign OECD developed countries, the limit is about USD 40 to 50. Why so high, increase in India.
9 0 Dear PM, Why govt is not publishing a comparative point by point brief description about UPA and NDA land bill in all the main news paper,so people will know the difference. I am educated but I completely don't know what is difference then how a farmer would know.pleas do asap otherwise we may trap opposition propaganda.
1 0 land procurement should not be for private project. It should be done for any national project where government stack is above 60 % and further apart from Muavja set for the land owner a permanent and regular amount should be paid to the landlord on monthly/quarterly basis as rent income from property.
3 0 Involvement  of more people and Transparency in the system can reduce corruption in public procurement.
3 0 Gov should prioritize Bills. Judicial reforms, police reforms, good and clean education system(bereft of politician owned/aligned), robust healthcare, building green cover across cities, cleaning rivers (not just Ganga), building sports culture, promoting tourism etc instead of passing such bills

3 0 Sir, the recent mining tenders worth Rs. 40,000 crores released by NTPC have been framed to limit competition by disqualifying Indian subsidiaries of Foreign mining companies from participation in "Make in India." These conditions are against India's FDI Policy which permits 100% FDI in captive coal mining.  Motive is only to facilitate cartels to win contracts at high prices, though Indian contractors have no experience in such large mines.
1 0 Sir, please review the procurement procedures of PSUs. Maharatnas like NTPC are Maha Corrupt, since their CMDs have procured their positions through money power and not through merit. However, even letters with specific and concrete complaints addressed to Power Secretary are not even acknowledged.
1 0 Sir in our country have more intelligent player {all game} and he have more skill but he have no plateform sow our perform mostly rural areas people.
1 0 It is presumed the Land Acquisition is relevant to the extent of portion of lands required by Farmers for the cultivation purposes to begin with may be more appropriate.A Message from slakshmanrao3@gmail.com
0 0 Requirement of Land for different purposes have been very well debated.Whereas, the very fact is Farmers alone are capable of taking care of our every day food.If this be the mind set,Farmers will have a better life style at any given point of time.A mission out of Imagination to reality alone is in race.!!! That  is the present status.A message from slakshmanrao3@gmail.com
2 1 ok it has been a long days with a lots of hindrances.still the land acquisition bill has not been able to got his form.i think it would be a debacle to the prime minister's make in india campaign.there should be a provision of free admission to any course like diploma degree engineering or any other course which would be beneficial to the his/her future.then they would have a reason to leave their lands for a great cause.
0 0 Your LA Bill-2015 will nullify all your positive steps in your tenure as a Prime Minister.
1 0 Large Departments where they have their own Procurement cell/divisions should consider forming a lead/central procurement cell/division to enter into Rate Contracts for common stores that will be required by its operational units in various locations in order to avoid repeat of Tendering exercise by all the procuring cells/divisions on the lines of DGS&D.
0 0 Dear PM sir, I don't know what is forex market's advantage or disadvantage for indian govt.

1 0 Auditing of accounts should be part of the all government offices. Grampanchayath to Central government should have transparent audit process through a Chartered accountant, which will change every 3 years.
1 0 RFP for the procurement should also include quality and punishment for supplying wrong quality. Public procurement now looks at only low cost. RFP for vendors should also include quality parameters along with low price. Design and User experience should also be part of procurement tender. For example, a government building should be built with architecture of local culture using LEED platinum concepts. Another example, now the software supplied government departments are not really good.

1 0 The reverse procurement auction method should be in sync with the tested Swiss Challenge system except that the Employer or the Procurement inviting agency invites auction for a project already prepared ! The internal mechanism for ensuring and mitigating integrity of Procurement is missing ! The International methodology of Procurement by leading financial institituions should be followe d including Quality cum Cost :: Stand alone Panel should be made for each sector in order to fast track !
0 0 Our gov should make a one I'd system .all Indian citizens have one I'd proff only which is made by gov co himself with new super confidential technique so that nobody can made a fake I'd proff like that and destroy all the vote cards ,driving licence,ration cardscards,pan card,aadhar card etc by doing this we create a strong system where gov should have all the knowledge about their citizens cards will operate by machines like ATM card ,personal record of citizens are also feed in them permanent
1 0 too much policing in procurement is also very counter productive, mostly it kills SME. when a contract is drafted for SME, there are penalties and penalties....... when the same work is offered to bigger companies or foreign firms, the reward increases and penalties decrease. u need to amend this, and give your officers more powers and trust them. Overall failures will decrease and enterprise will grow
2 0 sir I am regular traveller on Indian highway. I lot of time see the traffic jam on Toll gate as any Minister, Govt. Officer or any VIP person debate with Toll person for Toll exemption. Sir I like to request to cancel toll exemption to all people any ask to pay toll on Road. And ask them to show proof of paid toll and reclaim of respective office were he work. This will save our fuel also it will close issue to give extension for toll collection.

1 0 there is a bill for procurement of goods, services and contracts. but what about public procurement of employees, which is done by UPSC, SSC and large number of state PSC. what is happening in UP PSC is visible to everyone. If a person is asked to pay several lakhs for written test, at interview time, that person will start bribery from the first day of his job to recover that bribe paid to procure that job. Why Modiji is not taking interest in reforming the archaic and stinking PSC culture?

0 0 Sir this is regarding procurement and selling of goods we are so huge economy and why don't we also establish a entity like flipkart or amazon where govt will procure goods from micro industries slums where various sculptors make beautiful and very cheap products this will increase the micro industries and our postal deptt will get a new life as we can add it as a courier agency and then why don't we also sell services through it let drivers plumbers mechanics etc list their services on portal
0 0 E-procurement system has establish in our country but tender manage and department internal commission issue arise for newly contractors.
1 0 Procurement by the gov should be 100% transparent with the exception of defense sector and those that cater to national security. All procurement should be accessible by any Indian citizen having an aadhar number. The bids for tenders should be available in the webportals and available for viewing by general public once the bidding process is complete. No provision of secrecy shall be made available in the bidding and execution process.
3 0 Please launch a Website for JOBS where employer and employee can search for their jobs Seperate for private jobs and for govt jobs.This will be very helpful for all Indian persons. Please believe that lot of Pivate people pasted their requirements outside their premises but cannot post it on the website because website is not available. Please help Indians.
0 0 Automation through systemised methodology will result some what better. Even our people are ready to break those, we need strict security applications in this area of procrument and payment methodology should be through banking channel without any compromise.
1 0 in majority of central ministries, in procurement of goods and services, there is no transparency. in jan 2015 department of expenditure, published a list of 15 central departments, where e-procurement i not even started. secretaries of central departments, have been assured safety of tenure in their service rules and therefore they dont fear even their PM. Honble PM has done his best for controlling wholesale corruption, but dont have time for checking retail corruption, which is affecting us

MMRCA procurement:if France is not willing to comply to RFP terms then we shuld talk to eurofighter and check if they are willing.Buying off the shelf run can save money initialy but in long term it can hurt.Local manufactur will ensure that IAF gets all spare parts and upgrades w/o depending on France,things that are currently going for SU 30 mki and jaguars.Please dont cancel the MMRCA deal atleast we shuld talk to eurofighter first before taking a final call

0 0 BGP#111*Organ and Skin or  Tissue Donation I think Govt should launch Web Portal to register intent to donate any suitable organs and tissue for transplantation. Publication: There should be an online registration system for voluntary organ donation. Voluntary donors will be able to register their names on the website So Needy will get vital organs like Heart, Kidney Lungs , Liver, Pancreas  Skin and Tissue Doations etc . There should be Privacy of data
0 0 Due diligence needs to be given in terms of requirement gathering/understanding, designing/development and testing before launch of portal. There should be a road-map for various releases. Things are being implemented in hurry leaving end user difficult-to-use system rather than ease whether it is technical/financial evaluation or bid submission.
1 0 . If a 5 rupee product is manufactured , they may sell the product to ten rupees for intermediaries and at last we get the product at 50 rupees cost from the seller, is it the right way  of gaining money. Ok let them gain, but how the common man can survive himself from such huge losses that he is getting indirectly, and loosing almost all his savings in such buying. Why MRP, y can’t it be Selling Price (SP), sharing the profits for both seller and customer. Kindly consider this issue & solve
2 0 Please consider all these issues considering me as an illiterate ignored person who want to buy the daily need products for my life survival. Yes definitely the producer, seller chain have to survive by the gains, I am not objecting that. I am speaking in terms of food for living; every seller is fixing their own costs for the product in small towns like ours. We can’t go for super markets or metros as we don’t have such facilities in our town.
1 0 Dear Modiji, I am not getting completely what’s happening with the basic producer, wholesaler, seller and customer chain in our country. If a product MRP price is mentioned as Rs.100 on some product such as palm oil or some other like soaps, hair oils etc...  In some shops they will give for 70 itself or with still less or more based on known and unknown people, these price stickers makes a lot of difference to buy a product for a common  man.
0 0 for common items it should be single negotiated vendor for all applicable common products like stationary, cleaning item etc,when item required it can be requested online. most of the big company follow this policy. Government can follow same methodology.
1 0 Govt should have Classified Items List for all Purchase items with Price range for All Purchase items and should have minimum 3 Three Responsible officers of different Grade to verify and Approve the Same. Estimate or Bill Should be Verified from Sale Tax Deptt for TIN/CST and for Sale made and Tax paid on it. All Firms TIN/Service Tax numbers should be accessible through GST/Tax Authority Portal. So It can This wil

0 0 Rationalization of Tariff Structure for making MAKE IN INDIA SUCCESSFUL
0 0 The bill does not mention about any preference to small scale industries or entrepreneurs in procurement process. The GOI should mandate quality guidelines and necessary certifications for all materials that need to be procured and if a SSI or a new entrepreneurial venture has qualified on those quality parameters, then preferential treatment should be given to them. This would enable SSIs to have an assured future as long as they ensure quality and this directly helps Make in India (incl. Jobs)
0 0 Sir Launch a webbased  procurement like flipcart or amazon for all Government agnecies. Ensure all procurements are undertaken from it to derive economy of scale
0 0 All states have to start open Large Mandis (Producer to Consumer) in cities with better facility for the agriculture products stored well/kept & sold. In Mumbai, create 5-6 Big Mandis at different locations Vashi/Thane/Dadar/Andheri/Borivali/Byculla. This automatically reduces the cost for the buyer and better price for the seller. All this inflation problem can be tackled effectively. Due to middle man across this problem persists. Today Food bazar/Star bazar price is less and better quality.
1 0 Please stick to poll promises rather than criticising previous Congrss govts.
1 0 drastic changes are required in our judicial system, more than 60%fake cases are there due to corrupt judges and lawyers,most of the lawyers are renowned middle men for judges, a simple procedure should be laid which judges needs to follow in all the courts, Judges should be questioned and punished if the same procedure is not followed, lawyers should be punished if any case is found to be false. Please make some changes in the judicial system people are loosing faith
1 0 PM, we have great expectations from you that is the reason voted you to power and congress lost but your government is doing/saying what Congress use to say then what is the benefits will India get by voting you to power over Congress, I am trying to say that BJP government is taking U-turn means Rajnath said when BJP was not in power said that "if we come to power we will bring truth of netaji Subhash Bosh death" now as home minister saying that we can't disclose what is in files, pls think
1 0 1.The whole bill must be updated & upgraded. The best techniques must be utilized in the procurement bill.
1 0 Procurement shall be made cautiously, Records of purchased and consumed materials linked in a transparent manner so that wastage of procured materials in store can be avoided.
1 0 It is indeed very regrettable that Standing Committee intentionally delayed to lapse the bill. The bill is very much wanted to prevent all kinds of corruption adopted in procurement and bring transparency and make the officials accountable for any lapses.But regrettably it  seems it was deliberately lapsed. The bill must be enacted for eradicating  corruption in all spheres of procurement and save robbing of peoples' money

1 0 The revelations: Subhas Chandra Bose's family homes were kept under surveillance between 1948 and 1968.  Never ever trust Nehru-Gandhi family. The betrayal to patriotism, mistrust and exploitation run in the Nehru-Gandhi genes. This must be the intergenerational teaching for true Indians and the Government must not insult further the true sons of the soil by hiding the facts and sheltering the tyrant of the nations in the guise of international harmony. Veiled realism cannot build the nation.
1 0 Policy can applied to wastage management+salvage management. That if un used items or partially used items or wastaed items to be re-picked up back by set vendors & should be different vendors to avoid CIRCULAR TRADING after 6 months of procurment only. Food & Bevarages, grains, farmer suppliers to FCI also can be applied such policy. Salvage / wastage policy to be applied with Swatch Bharat Abhiyan. Different ministries can apply security cover depending upon its needs of secracy it can load mo
1 0 Order placement to full & final payment, entire cycle to made electronic including SMTP FTP with various vendor systems. Based value per item/product gradation of Bill-Of_material to be made & accordingly procurement policy to be defined. Higher the per item product & over budget, higher would be level of scrutiny & higher would be approval process at Govt machinary but must be electronic strictly. Policy approval by Cheif Secretoery & minister & procedure per category by other lower officer
1 0 Principles: Anonymity, Transparency, Certainty of service, payments to vendors, OEM etc Categorisation items / products to be procured as well as categorisation vendors / suppliers, Re-Ranking of both every 2/3 years, creterion of ranking to revisited & should be based on qualitative / quantitative inputs & scoring parameters. At least 3 suppliers to be identified & selected per item / product on electronic bidding basis without having access to highest of secretory in govt.
1 0 The news, "Call rates, SMS to cost less while roaming from May 1 2015 - now, with hands in glove nexus with TRAI, Telecom operators will charge different packs -  another trap for Indians to get more cheated. Indians are the victims of materialistic positivism. Boycott telephone use for 6 months to break this nexus between TRAI & Telecom operators and to have 'one India' - one SIM card and 'one tariff'' and 'free number portability across country'. Competition must be on reach and call quality.
1 0 How Serious is Govt of India (Honourable PM Mr Modi Govt - Modi Sarkar) about implementing GST ? still Await the reply on last Email how the 3 types of GST Like CGST, SGST & IGST would Set off with each other & How will India become Seamless Business Network with so many GST how will India become User friendly.As a Small Medium Enterprise how many Dept & local bodies one has to satisfy.Bcoz if   Dual Triple GST is introduce how it is becoming Single Indirect Tax structure ? How GST purpose meet?
2 0 We need to stop the collusion among the sellers and the officers involved in procurement.
1 0 bureaucracy is the biggest obstacle to reforms in economy, which modi ji want to create jobs and win 2019 LS elections. this is my experience of 27 years in central government. in lower and middle ranks in all central ministries, officers are seated for 5-7 years doing nothing to fast track reforms, but neither they are removed nor rotated to other ministries as CVC rules. when will Modiji start taking interest in affairs of all ministries or he will continue to be guided by PMO officers only
1 0 First come out of the veil of deceptivity. Be honest and have the courage to declare whose interest protection is TRAI's purpose of existence. Address the basics: 1. One India - one SIM Card - One tariff (why roaming / why multiple tariff /why no number portability all across the country???) - encourage competition only on the quality and reach of services. 2. One India - one internet tariff for connectivity - one speed - why multiplicity / why so much discussion???
1 0 Vendor rating should be done diligently. Capacity verification of firms done sincerely, feedback from past clients should be obtained. All top procurement officers be kept under intelligence surveillance. Chanakya had said, a king must keep a tab of all his mantris and any one found to be dishonest or working against the interest of the state should be awarded exemplary punishment and the honest ones rewarded.
0 0 By this our Govt can save in million per year. All govt dept are purchasing on credit basis by sellers and sellers not sell there items on credit. so middle man pay in cash and against it they earn more then 20% commission for supplying items. they also provide 3 or 4 bills as per your requirement. we can't do anything. it happen all over country. Its great loss of country every year. There must be direct purchase procedure/permission from sellers or over internet site ie. ebay, flipcart, snapde
1 0 Procurement in Govt should be like procuring for self. Thus do away with L1 policy. If I buy a TV I shortlist the best 2 or 3 brands, then study them in details and buy the best. For Govt procurement also follow the same model. We can use SEBI data to determine leaders in a segment for procurement. All bidding should be online. Reserve price should be fixed based on input costs, labour, manufacturing processes etc. this will ensure no cartelization. Self Certification where possible.
1 0 In offices there are lots of corruptions and delay. All central and State govt. work must be done on internet for transparency. All doc must be on net via scan. Work must be transfer in time to his superior and he also have time limit for same. there must be procedure for fine/punishment against (local) head of the Dept cause he is getting salary and facility for that and it must be upload over internet so we and other may know the result for people which not work in time.
1 0 31 Mar is a nightmare for government officers to complete allotted budget funds. Items are not received and the bills are forced to be passed by Head of offices. Funds if released and settled on quarterly basis the irregularities could be minimized. The items received up to 28 Feb alone to be counted for current financial year. It would allow one month time for verification of receipt of materials, installation of equipments if any
1 0 Please could you make all government more efficient? Please could you do talk with man ki baat with all govt employees? If they work whole nation will work. I am not saying they that they are not working but more efficient will help for us/country.
2 0 For fair land acquisition, once the area and land is finalized for acquisition, 80% land owners must agree to it, acquire it at market rate (not jantri rate), give land owner an option to be a share holder in the project, if the project is not executed (start to finish and working) in time or the purpose of acquisition changes, the land owner should get the land back. This will make the government and the private company who is acquiring the land responsible for timely completion of project.
1 0 There needs to be a single point registration for SMEs wherein after registration all e-tenders or tenders in their areas are uploaded. also there should be some procedures where in the Panchayats could also participate in e- tenders and get work done from the residents in the panchayats and benefits or profits are directly used in the welfare of the areas and these can be linked with MNERGA where womens can also participate and help their families - these can in areas of stationeries pen making

1 0 Simple steps should b advertised through social media, abt supply to govt deptts. Most of small mfrs donot know the procedures, how to supply govtgovt.small scale can create lot of jobs for less educated people.make 50 % quota for small scale sector. Remove conditions of registration etc for suuply to govt. Simply ask best quote online . Govt can promote small units by this step
2 0 Sir, 50% of total purchases by govt /psu/ state govt , should b done fm manufacturers having turnover less than 5 crores in last 3 years. There should b no need of registration with any agency. Bcs small people can not afford this, only well educated can get registered n get the benefit.small scale sector needs special care this time, with simple systems in place.this sector can create lot of jobs for less educated people.
1 0 If nation needs development farmer also needs d same we can't neglect them, put all d load on them. We can't commit this sin to rob them. We can't see them as weaker section. They should be made industry partners in case industry gets land from them for their set up
1 0 If govt employs need a dearness allowance increase to fulfill their needs farmers too need a gud price of their crop to live in this world where all other products are becoming expensive except farmers produce.
0 0 Sir plz make farmers equity partner of industry in the land acquisition bill and don't let them to be robbed by industry and govt as done before and this will remove d problem of rehabilitation , also provide them sufficient prices of their crops so that they don't suicide
1 0 Modi ji please provide one column to discuss about women security also......... because we need change
1 0 Yesterday Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam mentioned that formers whoever given land for #ppbill they can be considers as a share holders in that plan, it may be private/government. I felt it ensures formers life safety in long run. This bill is not clear in terms of industry types, land pricing and judiciary interaction. In any case government should not stop any one to move court in case of any injustice happen to Indian citizen. Government should come forward for open debate with people of India.
1 0 Labour Laws are vastly violated by our concerned departments. This causes heavy difference between public and private sector employees. Even if we have adequate laws, they are not satisfactorily implemented. Local and State Governments should be strictly monitored.
1 0 why private sector is being neglected by govt of India, while GDP is growing by Private industries and only benefits given for govt employees not for Private sector employees.Is inflation affects only govt employees, so the central govt periodically increase the percentage of inflation fund, so we request to Honorable PM Mr. Narendra Modi; for taking concern in making a policy for Private employees welfare also.
1 0 So as economist rotten wheat is more profitable than normal wheat. So why we should spend money to preserve the wheat. Now how can we increase the gov income via normal wheat more than the normal wheat. Reply me the answer or suggestion otherwise some ideas for it i will share tommorow
0 0 Just like this agri field is the ultimate source of economy, every field is depend on it in some forms. So we need to make it organised one. For eg: rotten wheat or rice used in production of beer or wine products, government take a good amount of tax from their manufactures. So gov. thought beer or wine industry is a profitable field so plan its budget to enhance this field. But if normal rice or wheat come in market gov have to pay not only its msp and its storage cost but also get less tax
0 0 If this field become profitable to common man only, government will not take any interest in this field. This field remain only for politically profit neither for country nor for the common man. So how can we make this field more profitable to government than industrial field? We have to manage this field properly. Sun is the ultimate source of energy but we use its energey not only in solar energy form but also in different form such as hydropower or air turbine even fossil energy products
2 0 How can we change this condition because every body lookafter on profit given side so if our government not lookafter agri field what is wrong in this? Now we talk about the ground facts. Despite of small portion of budget our economy depend upon agri becoz our major population is linked to the agri field.So Any good or bad decision in this field make a huge impact on population. If we want to grow up this field we have to make it profitable to government.
2 0 We have to deal our agri field just like other industrial field. But there is a big problem what is that. That is the so called loss via different mean such as subsides etc In agriculture field. And even no profit in form of taxes from the people of agri fields. On the other hand industrial field took some amount of subsidy but provide a good income in form of taxes to the government. Thats why our government budget has more role in industrial sector and very less in agri sector.

1 0 to bring bhumi adhigrahan bill, i think PM should personally talk to the farmers it self and tell the advantages and disadvantages of the bill. the bill should be design in such a way that nobody can make a misuse of it eg. wadra case. it should be advantageous to the farmers and not for any ministers. Govt. should help farmers by meeting them personally in their bad times and support them to increase irrigational production. farmers suiciede cases should stop in all respects.

0 0 Land acquisition bill must fortify and must remove the apprehensions of the farmers. Though most of the farmers who sell the land may be benefited, the cash in hand will endanger their future life since they do not know how to keep it long for the welfare of the family.

1 0 Public procurement doesn't encourage rational evaluation on basis of Best Fit to address a business problem. Buying process discourages 'courage of conviction' on part of evaluators to assess technological or qualitative superiority & simply reduces it to RFPs spec'ed with highest common denominator amongst barely comparable alternatives, keeping aside - at times - even the original business need if there is a unique solution provider and hence single bidder. No premium for first mover advantage
1 0 It's clearly understandable that transparency & competitive pricing must always remain the fulcrum of public procurement. However, buying any product, service or solution on the basis of L1 ONLY has proven to be more of roadblock than facilitating "best-in-class" approach. As focus seems to have wrongly shifted to 'following a process' to buy the cheapest, and no one questions if what is procured has met the original business requirement. And, such decisions end up wasting public money.

0 0 The purchase manager of certain types of essential/strategic purchases above a threshold limit must maintain a activity log recorded on daily basis online data-base which is available for view by the immediate superiors.
0 0 The bill should provide fix time table for different types of purchases. The purchase system of the bill is so bureaucratic that purchase process spoil the project schedule and indirectly increases the project cost which is not in the public interest. sometimes delays in procurement shelves the project or kill its utility or make the project irrelevant.
0 0 Wherever there is a possibility to hedge the raw materials, in case the final product prices are fixed/frozen/committed/under rate contract & having long term delivery, the corresponding raw material must be hedged to avoid market risk of fluctuation in prices of raw materials specifically of marketable commodities in commodity exchange.
0 0 All employees of the public entity ( Up to the highest level)connected with the procurement shall take a oath verbally and in writing that he will abide by the code of conduct in procurement process truly and sincerely in its letter and spirit.
0 0 In this digital world, the purchaser cannot be restricted to limited offer received against open tenders/panel of suppliers. The purchaser should be asked to arrange 2 to 3 additional offers of their own from new suppliers on/off shore through online digital channel.
0 0 It is observed in most cases that due to poor quality, the lifecycle of the material/job is less than the standard lifecycle even after paying high rates. The result-the materials/jobs are procured repetitively increasing the cost of project. For example why a road requires maintenance next rainy season in India whereas tar roads goes for years in south east Asia where rains are 8-9 months a year. There is fundamentally wrong with our system/standards. Supplier should give long term warranties.
0 0 The procurement policy should be assisted by a robust digital Inventory management system connected with the stores/production/quality. Before going for procurement, the Public purchaser should have all info about the performance of past purchased similar items like feedback from the user about its quality, life, usage, existing stock, purpose of procurement, exact requirement, technical recommendation etc., which helps the public procurement manager to take right decision.
0 0 Thanks for new updation regarding to right education.

0 0 1) Small and marginal farmers have performed consistently well despite all odds. 2) They deserve insensitive which the government always ready to give to industry people without application of mind. 3) Public Procurement bill should give the farmer 50 % more than the cost and Govt should assure to take all surplus produce. 4) Plz do not listen to Westernized capitalistic economists while framing the bill.

0 0 I'm very happy to join this group which is able to express my view.
0 0 there must be a act or law for those who (government officer under IAS, IAS or on permanent post in gov. enterprise) are taking/demanding money. the money which is demanded by them should be taxable and should be transfer directly to there accounts. there must be a relaxation for vendor in terms of tax who is paying the demanded money. In short the under table commission should be made publically.
0 0 there must be a bill on the officers of government enterprises who are taking/demanding commission of 30-40 percent of tender cost from the winning tender (parties)vendor/outsourcing industries. the officers are humiliate them if vendor refuse to give the demanded money in terms of delaying the payment procedure, delaying the project by confusing/complicating it.
0 0 Bhumi adhigrahan bill:-Take the land from the farmer or any other please ask to them if he is agree than take and give the proper price and royalty forever and take only on the lease not forever.It is my kind/humble suggestion.
0 0 Please give the all employee grantee job and job security in private sector also. If company is not growing or earning than fire the employee is not good.
1 0 I want discuss about LPG cylinder supply : Today i received cylinder & paid of Rs.660 (Invoice amount 635+25 extra), delivery boy collecting extra amount. my suggestion is why cont make online payment for cylinder booking. anyway government collected bank account for all customer. GAS supplier collecting extra amount from all customer. we has to think ex: every day Gas supplier selling 500nos GAS, who much they are collecting extra ??. supplier is getting commission also.
1 0 WITH THE HELP OF RESTRUCTURING OF POST OFFICE OR DAK VIBHAG IN EACH STATE WE CAN CREATE JOB AS WELL AS BUSSINESS FOR YOUTH BY PROVIDING AGENCY OR FRANCHISEE TO PEOPLE.BECAUSE WHEN PRIVATE CURRIER COMPANY EARN THEN WHY GOVT. SECTOR NOT EARN WHEREEVER IN EACH SMALL/RURAL AREA GOVT. ESTABLIMENT (POST OFFICE) IS AVAILABLE. BUT THIS FACILITY NOT AVAILABLE WITH PRIVATE. ALSO WITH THIS WE CAN START MORE SERVICES LIKE DIGITAL INDIA AT EACH VILLAGE. LIKE KIYOSK WITH SAME ESTABLISHMENT.
1 0 Make it compulsory that all the children of government employee will study in government schools.it will create historical change in education sector.As education is the base of development

1 0 In government we usually see the lack of check and balances, so In my opinion until we create a proper mechanism with decentralisation of information we won't find success.The solution can be found via technology. the every step and details which are not against national interest, should be declared on website with full details and live track record.Also, the responsibility and liability must be fixed and the guilty must be punished for non-performance.The time-bound actions should be mandatory.
1 0 public procurement bill should highlight the mechanism of procurement,, storage and distribution. from farm to family. Amul is one success story that speak about how procurement movement can flourish prosperity. the government should bring a uniform procurement policy linking to commodity exchanges, APMC markets of states,and government procurement agencies like FCI. a commodity procurement and price management commission could act as catalyst in procurement storage and distribution endeavor
1 0 Present system of  procurement in government is not full proof  system in-respect of quality  and timely delivery. Same item  we can buy at least 5 to 10% less from market.The procedure for taking any action against such contractors for ensuring quality and timely completion of works are so tedious and complicated that no officer can spare time and boldness for overcoming the red tape.So better to buy centralized system from quality firms and at least guarantee for service.
1 0 The present system of procurement from L1 through tendering is not correct and is the major reason for poor quality,  delays in work due to excessively low rates. The procedure for taking any action againt contractors for ensuring quality and timely completion of works are so tedious and complicated that no officer can spare time and boldness for overcoming the red tape. It is suggested that all works are carried out based on Standard rates contracts prepared by experts to avoid too low rates.
1 0 there should be guidance and coaching program on work culture, being professional, respecting to work for been paid, putting in hard efforts to contribute to the growth of the company. job is been looked upon 25 days of spending time at a place and being paid off for the same and expectations never end. how much have i contributed for growth which comes back, is never thought
1 0 Quality plays the most important role in execution and performance of a job. An item or a job can be performed in similar way with hundreds of options which influence the procurement rates. The tender finalization committee depending on the nature of work must deliberate the options of quality to be selected for a particular tender in optimum way to meet the required quality at best price. The quality should not have a over margin of safety than required which shoot up the cost of project.
1 0 There should be mechanism to arrest cartelization of suppliers by widening the scope of suppliers. Most of the times, the stringent qualification and longer past experience create false entry barriers and debar new entrants which encourages cartelization. There should be free entry with minimum qualification but having slab of % of job depending on the experience. This will explore the market rates of new entrants and also test their performance.
1 0 there should be joint conference and seminar on procurement strategy once in a year between procurement Heads of public and private entities along with the lead suppliers to share their procurement experiences. This is called PPPP (Public Private partnership on Procurement)
1 0 The present standard tariff of procurement rates of all government departments be discarded because they are 2-3 times higher than market rates and of even inferior quality of materials. An independent professional agency be entrusted to finalise the rates  on zero-base concept of all common items with clear & explicit specs across all Govt and public departments with the target to reduce the rates in the range of 50% to 75%. The rates to be reviewed every quarter.
1 0 tender is most crucial document in PP. If it is faulty, the whole process of procurement is faulty. The PPB must emphasis on various aspects of tender like measurement, quality, specifications, make and model of material, its preparation process, monitoring, regulation, comparison of rates with private entities for similar jobs.It is observed that rates in Govt tenders are 2-3 times higher than that of private companies tenders. There should be reverse Arm's length price test in the PP process.

1 0 in jan 2015 department of expenditure published a list of 15 central departments, who, despite orders since 2008, have not initiated e-procurement (which is mandatory if procurement crosses certain limits). whether responsible officers in these departments identified and departmental proceedings initiated? if not who will ensure that this bill will also be implemented? we know how public information officers are making a joke of RTI Act. why modi ji is failing to control corrupt govt officers?

0 0 Sir, Better if we have Built in Forum or central data base for maintaing all missing people in one blog so that people who has been found can be upload the pics to common data base and people should be able to search.
2 0 There is nexus of IT Officers & CA in exploiting in-transparent system of IT notices. Suggest to change rules of IT Deptt in which notice issued by IT Officer to tax payer be first posted on deptt website with electronic copies & then only print of notice posted on website be sent to assesse.There is ramped practice of notices being prepared but not posted by IT Commissioner who,being hand in glove with CA,create pressure to assesse to pay out&in event of having been paid-up notices are removed

1 0 My suggestions for limiting exploitation of poor farmers and preventing from suicide is: Bring legislation to ban any loan to any one in cash, also the recovery of such loans should not be enforceable. This will also give the Income Tax Authorities to trail who is lending the money. This is possible with successful financial inclusion of masses through Dan-Jan Yojana.
1 0 The farmers sale proceeds must be realized within defined time line say within 15 days from the date of procurement. At present public procurement from framers is in very chaotic condition,realization takes six month or more and in many cases it goes beyond a year. This makes favorable condition for exploitation of farmers by marketeers. If the sale proceed is not realized, how farmers pay the loan in time and for their no fault but fault of system interest burden increases leading to suicide.
0 0 PM SIR First we have to centralise our focus to our education system,  our old system teaches us how to work on set pattern. But needof hour Is we trained our youth and forthcoming youth to set a  new pattern me.ans they will have innovative hunger in them. This will brings newreasearches and Iinventions. SECONDLY there should be a healthy competetion generated among them.And opportunities will be given to all without any kind of favour.
0 0 Dear Pm ji, in our country reservation is given in all governament sectors to depressed classes as well as please do reservations to Backward Class peopels in MP and MLA Constituencies to enlight OBC groups politically, now u know well that in  our country all the major communities who having the strength of community he was winning candidate to the political parties, here so many backward talented people are unable to come forward in politics as they don't have strength of community.
0 0 Respected PM Sir, I have 2 of my views that can be very helpful. One, i would like to share is to completely ban any version 15 year old LMV/MYCL and make it scrap. by this we can have more steel growth and relief for heavy traffic jam and parking. we can offer owner of a car amount while giving their car for scrap. Second, I have seen many of young guys least interested casting their vote one thing we can do is to start making of voter id at every school for senior secondary students.
0 0 Dear Sir, Common man should have the knowledge on what is going on. to have the holistic view we should have a good Media coverage on the same. Like 24X7 television. It will create a lot of awareness with the same minded people and corruption will definitely come down. It will help in developing a new vendor and business opportunity. Thanks
0 0 Dear sir, We should have alternative education system, which will stress on implementing needs in more economically and effectively. Like: Agriculture: learning from the age of 8 it self. so they will have sufficient time to do all required experiment.
1 0 Public procurement system is worst in case of purchase through MHRD. Every educational institution is getting cheap quality learning aids and machines at a higher price. Government should form public companies to manufacture such things. UGC and AICTE are getting a lot of funds. but they are wasted by purchasing underquality things.
