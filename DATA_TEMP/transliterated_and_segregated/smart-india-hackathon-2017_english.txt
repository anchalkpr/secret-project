Here is my proposal to develop an application based on this.

Recently I noticed an idea which developed and showcased by some school children during their exhibition program in Kerala. The idea is that anyone using the debit/credit card on ATM machine, the card owner will be noticed by message and upon approval only they can proceed. Some sort of cheating can be avoided.
0 0 As a firm supporter of digital India moment, I strongly believe that government should enable infrastructure and extend support to citizens in embracing this great initiative. Having said that how come one of the large government organisations such as INDIA POST does not allow making online payments directly to citizens PPF accounts. May I request responsible ministry to look into this issue and take initiative to make all offerings made by post office to customers are digitally supported.Thanks
0 0 The professor who denied me admissions to the PhD course had pretended to publish my academic articles in a journal but even though he published only one, he did not tell me whether the other got published or not. He stopped interacting with me because he probably stole my idea to give it to some students of his for their theses. I have been discriminated against unfairly and the University of Mumbai has to be improved so that no professor will ever dare misbehave with students.
0 0 Earlier, the Supreme Court had introduced anti noise laws to stop people from playing music only during the Ganesh Chaturti after 10 p.m. but now, they should implement laws to prevent even neighbors from making noise. No one should talk, laugh or play music loudly while keeping their door open so that it will not disturb their neighbors. Plus, the residents of any building should be asked not to pry on their neighbors but respect their privacy.
0 0 There should be more government recognized PhD courses available online. If the other countries can do it, why not India? I had been unfairly denied admissions to a PhD course at the local university here even though I was highly meritorious. It is not fair that professors admit students of their choice. For instance, a Pakistani man was given admission in my place at the University of Mumbai even though he had failed his MA 3 to 4 times. Indians should be given more preference.
0 0 i am happy to share my views officially.we should add value education as a part of school and college education.every child below 15 years should be taught about leadership and teamwork.instead of awarding grades based on examinations alone,practical training (physical exercises)also should be added as a part of school curriculum.i am focussing on every child's attitudinal development because children maybe 40 percent of today's population but they are 100 percent of india tommorow.
0 0 I believe we should change the way we approach the education. We must try to teach the inference and not stick to rote learning. We must test the true understanding of the students and not just the way they can reproduce the answer from the book.
0 0 This is one of the biggest beauty a democratic government can showcase. "By the people" in the true sense. It helps us feel as a part of the building of nation. I strongly feel it must start with our education system. Reading the foreign system in a classical Indian style. Einstein is said to have remembered only those stuffs that he could not refer within 5 minutes of time, n here we are making it mandatory to remember all the isotopes, isobars, and what not of all the elements.
0 0 Why only 3 teams from each collage/university allowed take part? My University have more then 10,000 students and only of 6 x 3 = 18 students(max.) can take part. Why you are limiting the ideas? let whoever is interested to take part. Now I have some ideas on some problem statement of Smart India Hackathon 2017, but i cant submit it because already the team of three is prepared and submited. Number of teams should be at least 20-30. So that whole India an participate.
0 0 There is huge overhaul required in our transport system to make it more passenger friendly and much more safe and secure. The need of the hour is the upgrading of existing transport systems and introduction of new advanced transport systems to provide better transport facilities. Installation of CCTV cameras in buses, installation of distress call buttons, etc are needed to improve safety levels for woman passengers who use public transport systems.
0 0 Govt websites (NSDL, BSNL, EPF) should be up to date and working without errors. There should be a government verfied payment system for everyone. Like Paytm and other apps.
0 0 A knowledgeable and valuable counselling to Modi ji in person
0 0 While going through news papers I found that Transport sector needs a implementation of Digital India program. All the vehicle made mandatory to have DASH CAMERA and GPS. This will provide position of given vehicle as well as help in reducing corruption and dispute redressal mechanism. This will reduce crime on roads and illegal collection of money across roadway sector. Videos from dash cams can be used for solving the issues of accident and robberies. And can be vital for transport sector.
0 0 Please put a condition that ten percent of the vehicles on road should be electric vehicles in smart cities.
0 0 what is meant by sample data reqired? #IR11 #SmartIndiaHackathon2017, #MyGov

3 0 First and foremost CORRUPTION AT RTOs MUST BE ELIMINATED. As on today not a single Indian has got his/her driving license without having to pay bribe or using influence. It's the root cause of accidents.
2 0 There must be a insurance for the people who get los by the hacers during digital transition of money.thaks for giving me a chance to say my views.
0 1 my contribution to this great event is idea which may be used to identify the lost vehicles and avoid the traffic jam.The vehicles has to provided with GPRS module.The advantages by installing gprs module is ->it avoid traffic jam ->it avoid the theft of vehicles ->control the illegal activities done ->track any vehicles easily in order to achieve this merits the government has to make installing the gprs module mandatory in vehicles.This idea lead a great innovation in DIGITAL INDIA..

0 0 Toll Plazas are the biggest hurdle in vehicle movement on high ways. In fact why should there be a toll tax. Every person who uses a road consumes petroleum fuel. Cost for a toll tax should be included in the price of fuel. Portion of fuel price should be used only for making and maintenance of roads. Some road cess is already charges on fuel. If it is not sufficient it may be increased. NHAI should be abolished and one  Roads Authority of India be made for all roads.

2 0 Dear sir/madam, Two suggestions for Road Transport : 1. To encourage helmets Police should charge for a new helmet on spot and make them wear on spot, instead of charging fines. Thus everyone without helmet will have to buy from Police whenever he/she breaks the rule. 2. All the vehicles lying outside the Police Station should be sold in Auction after a fixed time of warning to the owner say after 6 months. This will help to generate revenue for govt as well as avoid junks.

3 0 Dear Prime Minister, I am an 81 yrs old professional manager in my 60th year of active working  life. My most critical feedback to you is about the utter lack of accountability, discipline and work ethics in our Govt offices including the Police. This malaise spans the entire spectrum of the hierarchy.None of your grand plans for DEVELOPMENT will fructify unless we have a disciplined work force and enforcement of law is strong and consistent.Punishment has to be exemplary and advertised.

Only on completion of the service should they get their certificate or be allowed to pursue higher studies or go abroad.
1 0 All artisans in India should be able to register themselves online through an easy tool. They should be able to enter the materials they need to create their handicraft. The tool should help them identify where the materials are available and the market price for the same and should be able to get them in touch with the vendors. They should also be able to reach out to retailers and suppliers who can buy their products directly from them without the middleman and the local goons.

If not this government can be considered as a failure and not doing anything for people though it is claimed! Sad reality

Hence, a good environment, security, need to know information n physical work....

0 0 India will become smart India, if it includes Overseas Citizens of India when it formulates polices such as demonetization of specified bank notes(SBNs). NRIs visit India once in a year or more and carry very few SBNs, probably 10k as emergency funds per person for use in India. It is drawn from our NRI accounts. Why is government not smart enough to allow us to deposit into our NRI accounts from overseas? Polices existing for those returning to India will not help those who are not! Help us!!!!

0 0 Our govt should connect each Ration card with a bank account by help of Banks through each Ration Store. Then, weekly once/twice an awareness demo on Card usage and advantages of digitalization should be explained to the people of rural areas. This activity should be started from Rural areas, it may consume some amount of time but which is very worthy and no one can escape from digitalization. Once the Rural area people have a Card for a family then it is very easy to promote Cashless India.
1 0 Sir i want to share my experience that 70% of vehicles in our nation don't have proper redium on it so there must be compulsary rule for vehicles specially for heavy vehicles like tractor-trolly,truck and many more that they have proper redium or any other reflective material on vehicles so there is posibilities in reduction in road accident mostly in rural areas. If such vehicle does'nt have redium on it so registration must be cancelled or the owner of vehicle must be paid for it.

Hereby, representing the contribution of Chhattisgarh in support of this initiative as well as NIT Raipur's initiative to nurture startup ecosystem in state.
0 0 I totally agree with Ravi Gupta. As an individual we dont have the time to clean the rods and beaches. An organization should be made where people go and clean all these public places. Also the government should have a good scheme to push the people for cleaning. One such scheme is on the Churchgate station where we get a one rupee recharge for every bottle or garbage we throw in the bin.
0 0 I agree with sameer vengurlekar. Action needs to be taken against smoking. When I walk on the street there is always some people smoking, someone spitting tobacco, someone eating pan masala. All this needs to taken care of.
0 0 I suggest that such an app should be made where a person using digital money should know which shops accept the different mobile wallets and BHIM. Otherwise it is a waste of time walking around the market without cash looking for stores that accept mobile wallets. And practically on 10 to 13 percent of the shops accept mobile wallets.

0 0 I think that, the name given to the event is bit inappropriate. It should have been named "SmartAPP-2017". A hackothon would be indeed a great event, but must be for different purpose. All the budding hackers from country for a days event try to hack into model of government sites and networks, like that of BSE, NSE, Union registry of citizens. Similar events are hosted by developed countries like US, which in turn helps the govts to know the vulnerabilities in their existing digital networks.

3 0 I was very happy when our PM announce swach baharat mission. But after two years it seems that swach bharat means only to make the toilets. We did not have any garbage recycling facility in most cities in India. Municipal corporations is dumping the garbage outside city. that is not environment friendly.  The govt. are collecting huge amount in SBCess but no use of that. Dumping the garbage should be stopped and recycling facilities should be developed in each city for proper disposal of garbage
1 0 Sir ,please ban all plastic carry bags production instead of asking people to ban that. You can have the power to ban currency notes itself . Then why cant plastic bags in all forms. Swatch bharat starts here only.You know all the bad effects of plastic bags in whole world. So ban that from production itself. It is more important than building laterine all over country. Human exctreta is decomposed but plastic carry bags wont for more than 1000 years. So which is important for Smart India ???

0 0 In our country,we don't have proper sanitation facility. Especially public toilets.There are no sufficient public toilets in any part of our country. And even the available toilets are maintained in a poor condition.Hence people are hesitating to use public toilets. I am not sure it will work or not. Govt should check for the feasibility of cleaning public toilets with prisoners. This will serve two purpose.It will be a kind of punishment for wrong doers and govt can provide clean public toilet.

1 0 Suggestion for Digital India Movement: In addition to the linkage of Aadhar No for the Election (Bio-metric voting), link everything  (data) with the Aadhar No. for all activities and movement.

1 0 Dear Sir, We need to spread the awareness of digital move benefits more, for which as a first step we need to make “Aadhar Card” compulsory for all citizens of India.

As you know without keeping any deadline we will not be able to achieve the objectives.

0 0 Respected P.M sir, Make it compulsary for shopkeepers or people who are sitting in market that they should card swip machines or paytm on their shops if they are in market.There are a lot of people who want to pay with cards but the shopkeepers refuse. Specially in towns or small citys where they earn a lot but dont pay any tax thats why they are not taking online paymants. Same cases are with private hospitals and petrol pumps in small citys. I hope this will definatly help us.
0 0 Dear Modi Ji, The Farmers of India need a solution to their farming needs. This is felt much in the need of fertilizers for their seedlings to give a good yield. My contribution is a proposal to provide free fertilizers to farmers across the nation. I have put forward the idea as a narrative idea which could developed further into a very comprehensive plan involving all the resources in a big way. Hoping that the idea would contribute to Nation building. Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan , Jai Vigyan.

1 0 TOLL @ highways-FASTTAG - Toll companies must keep their boom barriers for FASTTAG lane open if for some reason their FAST TAG readers does not work. I have seen many tolls where fast tag hardly works and they don't make any visible effort to correct it and start collecting cash instead. Avoiding loss of revenue will be their incentive to keep FASTAG working all the time.
4 0 Suggestion to reduce the corruption in govt. Department, Usually people pay bribe to get there work done fast. If there is scheme like 'Tatkal' or urgent with higher fees and good service, people will sure pay directly to the goverment instead of middleman & broker, who generate corruption in all fields and this payment could be made through digital means too.

1 0 No exams on paper, but in field, 1-all PSU recruitment should be based on projects. 2- all the faculty pay should be based on projects. 3- all the fund towards education should be into Labs, libraries, and projects. 4- all PSU's should be involved in encouraging projects of their importance. 5- competitive exams must be the eligibility of one's knowledge but not employability, just scholarship's should be given based on the score but not salary. 6**-All unique projects should be awarded.
0 0 First let's start a different culture of education in our Nits and IIT's 1- all the faculty and student's should be on the same side of the table. Professors should no more rule the students but guide them. 2- no paper exams,  all the book and paper work are home work for students and extra work for teachers. The whole game runs about PROJECT. 3- all theory is actually going in vain due to underutilised knowledge, we don't want knowledgeable,  but wise, learning according to the reqirements.

And this way we can eliminate curruption from root.

0 0 In my view we can have more parallel  networking support for  data transmission through railways,high tension towers used by electrical transmission  companies which are spread all over the country and which have line of sight for long distance to transmit data through microwave or optical fiber open cables . railways and electrical companies may be benefitted by additional revenue from existing assets or for their data transfer.This is a concept only feasibility,cost effectiveness to be checked
0 0 In india 92% of the People are using low value currency notes if they have high value notes like Rs.500,1000 and 2000. They need to change for our day-to-day expenditure. So, high value notes only used by "crorepati's". We are normal People Rs.100 is big for us to use it.For example,If i go to ATM to withdraw money only on Rs.100 not more than 100 for expenditure.
0 0 First of all i made hearty congratulations to the honorable prime minister for demonetizing currency. I should say something which necessary to consider in black money as well as Demonetization, banning of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 is a master stroke but re-introduction of new Currencies of Rs.500, Rs.1000 and Rs.2000 create lot of corruption on the upcoming years it will badly affect the economy within few years. So,completely block Currencies  above "Hundred".This reduce the black money prominently.

Its a precautionary measure an one can avoid spam calls

1 0 I come from a ruaral area in Bihar where I see very low level of digital literacy. To increase the digital literacy I suggest following: - Awareness through pamphlets at all major rural markets. The infrastructure like PayTM is missing. This can be improved through broadband penetration, but before that behavioral preparedness is necessary. - The school children will be incentivised to educate their neighbourhood. -BDO level and Panchayat level functionaries will be roped in for change.

0 0 Respected P.M., Thanks for bringing this great initiative of UPI and USSD for cashless payments. I have used USSD service for transferring my money from one Account to another account. Difficulties I faced during this transaction was , I had to remember IFSC code and Account number of beneficiary . This method can cause mistakes , since account number is entered manually . My suggestion is to merge UPI with USSD , so that one can directly make payment by USSD using Virtual Address of UPI.
0 0 Mobile Phone has spread in the country at a good pace. However, it is currently restricted to places where Networks are available. We should enforce a Law where any new Network Provider Company coming for registration, should first provide networks in Non-network zone.

0 0 To take our education standards High I have a suggestion to make. Recently I was with my doctor  brother in law who is a senior professor working in dubai. He has more than 30yrs teaching experience in India and love for the subject. I was surprised with the system in dubai medical colleges to rate the faculty by students. A senior professor has to be rated by a student! If this be applied in India our standards high as the quality of education will be on the student's understanding the subject

We need alternative of Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Gmail, Google etc. Software development can be done from home and it will also create a job for majority of people familiar with programming language, if not any diploma course should be enough for them to get involved in such a project.

1 0 Since our economy as well as governance  moves towards digitalisation, there is a potential threat of a cyber warfare. To counter this, India could develop a platform of operating system as well as search engines which are out of reach of foreign MNCs, particularly when India is the source of world's best programmers and software experts. It is essential that a certain amount has to be dedicated towards this serious threat as the third world war will indeed be a cyber one.
1 0 Dear Indian Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, I see that you and your team dream big for India but efforts were wrongly directed .Even today, many Indians do not have basic human needs and deprived of their fundamental human rights. If you and your team wish to take India forward, efforts should be focussed on rural and agriculture development. Without lifting people's life who are living in rural and regional India, you can never dream of taking India to the global stage.

0 0 I believe that planners did not expect long queues for 40 days in banks after 8th Nov., 2016. It may be that India has little expertise on BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS. There  is not even one university in India offering any course in this field. In many developed nations, its importance is realised and its tenets used in everyday policies and decisions. The problems of demonetization may be partly due to  this void. We need to analyze the causes / faults of the plan to avoid the same in future.
0 0 The nation is passing thru turbulence of demonetization. Some things have gone astray. A lot of negative impact can be erased IF the culprits caught with old and new currency since 8th Nov., '16 are promptly punished. Otherwise, it may boomerang.
0 0 For Banking / online transactions / Rtgs to be 24 hrs * 7 days * 365 days to ensure smooth less cashless operations on banking holidays / national holidays. For all government organisations / departments to accept fees / taxes / duties / charges through online fund transfer from all types of banks ( public, private and others ) ; not just PSU banks.
0 0 technologies that human capital is expert in but are not state of the art. In the long run I think it will cost the country if the 2nd step is followed.So,I think their is a dire need for workshops and training students in the university rather than at company once they are hired.This will also help Students learn about technologies if they want to be entrepreneurs. #SmartIndiaHackathon2017 #MyGov
0 0 Sir, This is a great initiative by the government.But,I think Government should conduct some workshops to go hand in hand with this.This should be on technologies that are being used by industries today.I think we are creating some great engineers in our country but the technologies that they are being trained in are not state of the art.So,Now companies have 2 choices 1)Train them in new technologies and employ them in technologies that they are not experts in. 2)Build their projects with

0 0 as i have posted land rent money problem. my suggestion is that land rent any type of rent should be legalize,land owner/coaching center should be registered under government scheme.without registration he is consider as illegal getting money so that government can get tax and can apply to good purpose .this is not a problem but an issue why they are not giving tax whil enjoying every thing that country provide us. money should not be in limited hand specially those who is doing nothing work.
0 0 sir, i am student. i am preparing for job. sir in metro cities shop/ROOM/FLATE RENT is a source of income without doing any hardwork,just get 2 to 3 lakh income/month, for big builders it may be around 15 to 20 lakh per month, even they are not giving any tax. during demonetization, there is no effect on these type of people, they just order us, give monthly room rent otherwise leave it.therefor they get handsome money when no budy have,this source of income is not come under goverment area.

1 0 Hello, Hope all is well. First of all i wish best of luck Modiji for success of Demonetization.

If Govt. can do this so automatically India will grow as fast as china. For ege, In surat we are selling diamond processing machine which before mostly importing from Israel.
0 0 My Idea to promote greenery and plantation is simple and easy to implement. Whenever there is any plantation drive at any city/town/village etc, local government authority must ask to nearby shop/home/industry/field owner to take care of the plant near to them, and Government will rebate/recognize them in taxation or other manner.Traditionally the guy/department was taking care of that task would now have to maintain a record and help the person facing any difficulty.

Like rations, unprocessed clothing, books, newspaper, travel with in the country etc. Coz those things are already taxed and mostly belongs to grass roots level of india economy, due to this not only people will be encouraged to demand for bills for the above but also will be encouraged to file tax returns to take the benefits of the schemes instead of raising the tax slab so instead the economy can boost

Also would like to mention that India Post, which is covered widely all over India (including the remotest areas) is to be made online and digital, wherein all the transactions which are to be made by cash is to be completely converted to digital/netbanking/cashless. Also doing this way we can completely reduce the risk of theft or damage to the post office accounts and its transactions as these will be in Digital Post Office A/c

0 0 Online transaction and digital India The following attached PDF presents the reality and unwillingness of rural and some urban people to use online mode of transaction and the advantage of demonetization. I have presented some solution for this, which may be useful for the implementation and may change the mindset of people also attract the people to go online
0 0 Respected Modiji , Special focus on our railways is that former government gave more trains but they were not serious railway safety. Especially rail accidents, disasters are day by day increasing . we need more trains but it should be more safer. Most of the rails are not effective and give focus to remove the technical problems relating rails and main focus given to this issue in 2017 budget presentation.
0 0 Demonetization is on the success path.As a citizen I have an opinion that This is a brave action taken by Modiji. most of the other political parties attack the PM on this issue . Government can resist and fight with this issues on February national budget by good presentation by considering our farmers, Middle class people, Health programs -special focus to Cancer,HIV, Communicable diseases,low interest rate policy, women development etc.
0 0 Digital India is a good idea . I have some suggestions relating with this Digital railway service that means each citizen can understand policies of government in railway centers by visual screens and share their ideas there. most of us are mobile users that is why people are very effective to use it. so all central government department must ensure their services by means of digital communication.
0 0 Sir now if we are making India digital India then we must also start talking about E-hygiene in digital means.. Cyber security is need of the hour and we must start thinking about cyber security with digital India as without E-hygiene digital data is vulnerable.

1 0 Try to solve already persisting crisis in Railways:1) Transgenders are common threat to passengers in Bangalore trains, forcibly collecting money.2) Workers employed by railways keep on shouting nonstop to sell goods inside trains, makes journey uncomfortable.3)Local goons making living, by alloting empty seat for money, bribing from innocent passengers.
0 1 Try to solve existing crisis: 1) Trains making unnecessary halts in between railway stations, more than 10 times before reaching destination. 2) Train toilets are horrible, waste disposed then n there in railway station itself. 3)Train seats are uncomfortable, no flexible seats for long journey.

We want to participate in the hackathon, as we are allowed to moonlight (work on any idea, which is not directly competing with company products). Currently hackathon seems to be only allowed for college students. Kindly allow salaried software engineers also. We can provide a professional solution quicly. Note : you can keep such teams out of the cash reward system.
0 0 Respected Sir, Please make a plan to install the ATM machines in all the villages. All the villages have post offices (Currently very less work load) so we can utilize the post offices and we can install the ATM machines. so that the village peoples can withdraw the money as per their requirement. The withdrawal limit can be reduced as compare to city ATMs to avoid the money consume.
0 0 Comment 2 (Continued):These ATVM cards are issued by indian railway and should have all india validity. At the ticket booking counters they don't accept credit/debit cards as of now but if you can accept your own ATVM card as mode of payment it will be easier for us to book ticket and not to fight for change. Currently, ATVM cards cards can only be recharged at the railway counters but if you allow us to recharge it via plastic currency then it will be easier for us to book. Thanks.
0 0 Sir, Now a days we are talking very much about cashless economy as there is shortage of cash in the market. But there are some existing facilities are available with Indian Railways that should be modified so that we can go cashless always. Here are the points: 1. Note that in today's scenario at all major stations ATVM machines are available. But, these machines work only in the respective railway zones only. I.e. my ATVM card issued at ECoR, Bhubaneswar is not accepted at the Mumbai ATVMs.
0 0 Respected Sir The internet should be strengthened for a good cashless transaction. In the last ten days I could not do cashless transaction twice. Both instances the, once in a petro bunk and the other in a hotel , reply was failure of the internet. In some places the internet was very slow.

0 0 I want to ask #SmartIndiaHackathon2017 #MyGov #IR1 why we not introduce a new system in which there is no ticket booking counter for reservation of ticket and it is totally online from e-ticket this will also increase the digital payments or we can introduce a system in which each coach have 2 TT on both side of gates of coach for booking ticket and avoiding non tickets ones from entering the coach this can also create huge job opportunities for the youths and avoid non ticket one from entering.
1 0 If anyone like my idea like my post.i think it is best idea for cashless transactions.Every one having adhar card.change that as a adhar+smart card. That card can use only that person.

He can recharge adhar.he can receive money through adhar.

0 0 Sir I have attached few suggestions for IT changes which can promote digital transactions.
2 0 Dear Sir, let's create our own India's email and social network system like China has. Recently zindagi millions like us lost the entire email ID data due to theft as acknowledged by Yahoo. But there has been no action on Yahoo from Indian Govt, they discounted our security. PFA acknowledgement from Yahoo received by me. The similar thing will keep on happening and India will keep loosing it's peoples data. We need to come up with our own IT infrastructure for safeguarding people.
1 0 Sir my idea is transportation infrastructure as Indian government is sending lot of money on roads maintenance. I read this some where Mix metal chips in Bitumen while constructing road. After few years when roads are damaged because Bitumen losses it binding property. So to regain it's adhesive property we can heat road by microwave, microwave will heat up iron along with Bitumen . After this use roller for compaction. This can increase the life of roads up to 2 -3 folds. Thank you sir

2 0 Honourable PM sir, Please ordered that all the Private schools and higher education institutions should collect their fees through digital mode.If they are collect the fees as cashless then they can't make BLACK MONEY.
2 0 Respected PM SIR I would like to suggest on the topic of digital currency. My suggestions are as follows There should be facility in ATM’s/post office/Railway / Payments/fund transfer etc using  AePS in a single Machine. So that card  fraud, transaction charges and manual mistakes may not occur. Please make Aadhar enable payment system(AePS)more versatile .There should be be cheaper devices which can be connected to phone and can read finger prints and iris.(like e-kyc of jio ).
1 0 Digital India...Make the Petrol Pumps digital. Introduce a cap on cash deposit. For urban areas, only 30% of total sale can be in cash and rest has to be cashless. For rural areas, the cap can be 50%. Everyone visits petrol pumps and people will learn to go cashless soon.

0 1 Centre should not in the business of railway transportation, national railway should be in semi-government. The state government should not need approval of central government for linking state districts by railroads. State can develop its own rail road without seeking center's approval. There should be department called DoT department of Transportation for land, air and sea. Get rid of railway ministry, civil aviation ministry. Consolidate these to one Department of Transportation (DoT).
4 0 I want to present my idea to govt of India,finance ministry to introduce biometric process in ATM machines.Sir,I think it will make easier and safer for every class people if one uses ATM machine with the help of his/her all five fingers or both eyes scaned by database in RBI instead of ATM cards.This process contains two steps login first one is biometric recognistion and second one is alphanumeric login through touch screen.kindly read my idea attched here.thanks Abhishek Mishra Engineer
0 0 Sir, We the people really looking for corruption free india where each and every people trying to make money in illegal way if they have power or option to do so. We need to change mind set of every people. People who put there property for rent many cases either they are not providing PAN or asking to pay by cash. Even they are bluntly saying if not able to pay by cash just vacate the place. We have to engage civic bodies to make that payment through legal channel with accountable way.
0 0 There are difficulties for the people reaching KSR Metro, as the counter made for this purpose will normally have some or other issues. Hence I recommend to provide facility to get platform ticket through any non-cash payment using IRCTC or other Railway portals. SMS received itself can be treated as Platform ticket. This will facilitate public in general.

0 0 To create a digital world what we need first is the energy and there are lots of villages where people don't have electricity even today. In order to use the full capacity of the people residing there, we must promote the source of energy which do not require much investments and can be created from locally available resources like wind/water/sun/waste/Biogas. While promoting the industries we must focus on small scale skill development programs to train people to create tools for better economy
0 0 We need to put in place a robust & permanent mechanism for cyber security -ensuring safety of digital data,financial or otherwise.Setting up of effective &  foolproof cybersecurity framework will make adoption of e transactions that much more acceptable for the masses.ITexperts,cyberlaw experts,cyberpolice,Ministry for Cyber Security??,should be set up to this end.Also intntnl agency on lines of Interpol should be created for cyber security.

0 0 Sir, on focus to Digital India Project. I would like to give ashort suggestion about cleanliness that should be the focused topic. As we all know that there are a lot of topics to focus. As i observed according to a student vision, there is no toilet, no dustbins found around us when we see our surroundings,so if a person wants heartly not to dispose waste on roads, etc.But forcefully have to do soo.

0 0 I have one plan to improve digital literacy of India. In today's India, most of people are aware of electronic gadgets at least of mobile which means that they have fulfilled the initial prerequisite. But when the matter comes related to money, people becomes extra conscious and think about the negative impacts. It happens because either they haven’t tried the digital payment or they have heard of some cases that occurred many years back.

Please push he banks to upgrade the ATM's at the earliest help the fixing correction at banking Thanks Viswa

My humble suggestion is that Govt should via its National Informatics Centre, MoFinance etc should launch a Govt owned e-wallet app similar to paytm which will not only restore faith&acceptance in digital payment but will also boost up govt credibilty on demonetisation
1 0 Good evening respected PM JI! see the attached file on demonetization.

0 0 To make India digitally strong . we have to first create an atmosphere to avoid talent going out of the country.U.S has encashed talents from all over the world. The success is because of insecurity for immigrants. They are always kept on toes to perform. No reservations,no politics,importance to work ethics,forced to update knowledge year to year, access to programs to update capability, no room for the word 'not possible'. You take any software company in US Indians share is max in success.
0 0 Sir, Recently you mentioned that highest number of court cases in India is of payment related like cheque bounce, I have a solution to this. Most of these cases happen with current account holders and no current account can be opened by bank without PAN CARD, what merchant do is that they open number of current account with different bank and issues cheque and  keep funds. In this case bank should inform  RBI about acc no. and PAN CARD and RBI should freeze bank acc opened with that pan card
0 0 Proving with data how Rs. 3000 per week cash withdrawal limit would make demonetisation smooth. Three of my suggestions among RBI/gov's new measures.
1 0 the biggest deterrent in adoption of digital payments is that all the new schemes(like AEPS etc which provide cheaper transaction costs and faster settlement)have been given exclusively to banks.While europe is moving to an open banking architecture, India although ahead in its backbone payments infrastructure is limiting competition and  innovation because it is banks who have exclusive right to provide these services.Suggest you open up APIs of AEPS to registered 3rd party players

1 1 A good number of seizures of hoarded new currency have been made.  While this process is to be continued we have to ensure that the seized currencies are again put to circulation with out keeping the same in the vaults of seizing agency as seized property for legal proceedings to follow which is time consuming.  This will ease the currency shortage to that extend which is the need of the hour.This can be done by depositing the amount in the Treasury/RBI/Bank etc.with valid acknowledgement.

0 0 Hon’ble PM Sir, Why dishonesty has taken roots in our social life is because our education system doesn't speak about the power of honesty & also parents are not interested in making their children honest & upright citizen of this country. So some technology or medicine is required to be supplied to each household in our country to make India of your dreams.
4 0 Respected PM Sir, Hats off for your action against black money. I would like to share my thoughts to stop corruption happening in Banks. like if RBI fits display in every bank for customers where customers will know exactly how much amount the bank getting form RBI, and how the bank distributing to the customers. Then the common people and RBI can keep track on that bank.
0 0 Hon’ble PM Sir, The scheme of demonetisation of currency is nothing but weeding out of corruption which has taken roots in all institutions & also in all spheres of life. The scheme is being derailed by banks let them be PSB's are private sector banks & this is the reason that  corrupt and influential people have been able to hoard  the bundles of new currencies at the cost of poor peoples life. Co-operative sector banks almost in all states are busy in converting old currencies of politicians.
0 0 I think the New currency should have come with expiry date and QR code. The Mobile application can be used to easily identify the fake currency by scanning the QR code. And the currency which is going to expire will surely come back to banking system. Modi G has to take a strong action who betrayed the nation (who has black money and those who are helping the black money holders to exchange their money) on demonetization move. Otherwise the people who are supporting this move will be disappointe
1 0 corruption is not so easy to remove ,till date what income -tax has do regarding attached news
0 0 demonetisation is a good move once implemented mercilessly without loopholes blocking effectively all hoarders/hackers Hoarders are always shrewder; as much as possible they exchanged specified bank notes thro vulnearable public across counter/ PMJDY account; illegal exchange goes unabated; hoarding in new currency in crores seized is only tip of iceberg; much more is hoarded in new note; unscrupulous bank staff from top to bottom and cash hamdling agencies for ATM are the cause; plug;punish.
0 0 I would suggest the concept of STD kiosks. These Kiosks became redundant after Mobile revolution. Now the same concept can be revived for making digital payments to help those not literate with digital environment. A small fee may be charged for every transaction made through these kiosks.
0 0 System should be developed so that, broker can deduct TDS for short term capital gain (as done by banks for interest on savings account and FDs) in transaction of equity, debt, mutual fund etc and submit the information to tax department. The adjustment can be made during the ITR filing.
0 0 The PAN card can be issued along with birth certificate as a mandatory document. For all accounts in Banks(including Jan dhan and co-operative bank Accounts), PAN Card should be made mandatory document. The PAN card for all family members shall be linked. Once system is established, all the information for all bank accounts for one PAN card can be traced easily.
0 0 6, impose tax for everyone but as low as possible. 7. Give open permission to start any business. If any fault found , give 2 opportunities to change so, else cancel the  permission till it satisfies the necessities. 8, Make some credit services to get the machines or fixed assets , to the new entrants in the business. If we could able to do all these things without any discrimination or partiality, it will give up a  high impact towards the Indian economy!!
1 0 Respected Hon'ble Prime Minister, 1. Demonetisation effects only if it done after ensure sufficient exchange. 2. Why can't we collect national debt from the citizens of India like small amounts with different payment methods? What if national debt decrease? 3, It is better to make sufficient and effective code of laws and ban politics from the country? Actually why we need politics? 4,We need equity not equality! 5, Ensure Good laws for effective and speedy decisions from the Court.
0 0 For effective implementation of cashless and corruption-less economy two pills are required: 1. Limiting cash transaction to Rs.20,000 per transaction and 2. Limiting the maximum cash one can hold in their household/business premise to Rs.50,000 Above this ceiling, an enterprise may apply for higher cash holding limiting by applying for the same with a fee say Rs.10/lakh. This will not only reduce cash requirements but also helps income tax officials to settle cases of illgotten money easily
2 0 Respected Sir PM, I have a great solution to end the corruption of these 2000 notes also. Many rich men and tycoons have stashed money by changing old notes with new notes of 2000. My recommendation is demonetize 2000 notes also just like 500-1000. Those who have withdrawn 2000 rs notes can deposit their money into bank. The amount person has withdrawn or exchanged can be deposited in bank but not more than that. I hope such solution can aid to destroying black money. #EndBlackMoney
0 0 Everyday we saw that crore of New money with old currency found as black money and this black money exchanged by the bank.it means govt do good effort but the bank employees or others don't govt have to take step for them because atlast the only the govt will responsible for this. Here is the suggestion that The new currency issued by the RBI to the bank RBI have the record that how much amount they send to a specific centre so atlast the govt just want to take the accounts of that rupeest t

You are doing well sir but time is less hence think about population control and cast free environment just humanity is only one cast. Please adapt ahinsa dharm like Mahatma Gandhi for Pakistan issue
0 1 Another most important thing in the conversion of rural areas into cash less areas is, WE MUST ENSURE THAT THEY RECEIVE ALL THEIR EARNINGS/PAYMENTS BY DIGITAL MODE ONLY, all Govt and Pvt sector bodies should make all payments to the villager by Digital mode only, beginning with, making all APMC markets, mandis and any trader who buys agri products, must to go 100 % Cash les, this will lead to immediately conversion of a huge transaction amount into DIGITAL Currency, details in pdf attached ..
3 0 "Suggestion Regarding Black Money Seizures". Present time is very crucial for taking measures to seize Black Money, and this process can be speeded up instantly and rapidly, by introduction and mass advertising of a scheme - "Desh Ka Sipaahi" With a slogan saying - "Inform about black money, and get 10 percent of seized black money as A Reward" for becoming 'Desh Ka Sipaahi', "And the name of the informer must be kept secret". More details in the pdf attached....

Also they will reduce fuel consumption and thus promote a clean environment. Every solar panel can also charge reusable batteries that can support electrical and electronic equipment. Jai Hind.

2 0 Respected PM Sir, I want to submit my suggestion regarding the Vehicle Registration in India. The State code in Vehicle Registration No. should be abolished as it reflects diversity or a sort of division of a single nation into multiple entities rather all the vehicles across India should start with a single code to reflect a feeling of single nation. Secondly, the road tax, which is once in a lifetime tax, should be valid across whole nation rather than a particular state.

1 0 Dear PM, Regarding Demonetization, few ideas to share: 1.In the Banks who are given more loans to politicians or officers they might be more closer in relation and might be involved in taking commission and converting black money to white.They must be tracked and punished. 2.Kindly do the audits of the banks in district level,hobli level for every two weeks by IT, RBI officers only. 3.Kindly start the HELPLINE,TUTORS..etc for villagers,farmers,poor people to make use of cashless trasnsaction
0 0 Dear Sir, Regarding Demonetization, few ideas to share :- 1.I am from South India, daily one or the other person is caught in transporting more than 5 lacs of 2000Rs notes from one region to another by Polices.If they are involved such activities, kindly punish them and ask the IT or RBI to take all these cash immediately give to the bank.This can be utilized by common man in the ATMs or from Banks . 2.Most of the Bank managers who are especially in Metro cities should be tracked.

0 1 Mr.PM,I see the struggle of peopl wihdrawing cash from ATM&Bank. With deep of sense of interest I would like to say one of my ideas, Once you filled the ATM's of all bank branches everyday then people would not go to bank and stand for one day. Even standing in queue for 3 hours they just go off because of the in sufficient money. I will be so grateful when you look into this issue. Thank you in advance.

1 0 Modi sir Regarding cashless country, in Japan there are lot of credit companies where NEW users get cash back award, n that cash back can be used for only online transactions only, to lure new customers to go cashless.

1 1 Sir, one suggestion to control black money-   Cash money  should not be allowed for above ₹50000 transactions. all transactions above ₹50000 must be done by online fund only and bill must contain transaction id/number on it. Service charge for online transaction should be zero or minimal.
2 0 Govt should start taking money by card swiping machine in various depts i.e Railway ticket counter, various tax depts, etc. apart from online facilities. First Govt should set example by making all dept cashless to promote cashless.

1 0 Honorable P.M. I have a suggestion regarding Cashless India movement. Common people who work in service sector have no problem going cashless, but real problem is most of the shop owners across India are still not ready to adopt change. They still don't provide any digital gateway. My suggestion is if you make it compulsory rule for shop owners who have shop act license to provide at least one digital gateway for transaction, then it will definitely give boost towards cashless India
0 0 Sir,after demonetization  it is observed that poor and middle class people are suffering and new currency notes are easily circulated to rich people it is a cause of concern,so kindly stop printing of new currency and fix accountability about delivery of new currency notes in wrong hand or print plastic currency only for 500/2000 notes.
0 1 *99# mode can really help India go cashless. Rural people, auto, cab, maid, milkman, sweet shop, kirana, elderly are not comfortable with wallets or credit cards. In 'Mann ki Baat' emphasis can be given to this mode of payment; requesting people to open bank a/cs and get mmid pins. Also make bank a/c vital for citizenship. Or give incentives of insurance etc to make these people open bank a/cs. Regards
0 0 Jai Hind I was going through different payment modes. Most of us have credit or debit cards to pay in malls. Netbanking for online bill payments. But how to pay auto, cab, maid, milkman, sweet shop, kirana etc? Most of them are not educated. They do not have bank accounts. There are so many ewallets. We cannot download all. I found the *99# mode the easiest to pay these people. All it requires in a phone, bank account, MMID number & pin. It does not require internet.

So many countries are doing this vedic method & the whole project will help the atmosphere
1 0 We have a concept of PUC. However, this is the most corrupted department. I have often observed, the issuers of PUC do not check the pollution level of the vehicle and provide them the PUC certificate. I observed many diesel cars, trucks and buses throwing BLACK smoke and making hard to take breath. People do not understand, that the vehicle and petrol/diesel is theirs, but not the AIR. They do not have right to pollute it. Strict action required on this.
2 0 Dear Sir,initiative by Mr Nilekani will take time.In the meantime bank may be tasked to ensure 1. 100% debit card distribution. 2. At least 80% credit card distribution. 3. Distribution of Card swiping machines and scanner codes to vendors within the branch area. This may be made timebound. 4. Setting up of kiosks on information on digital payments where volunteers can assist poor,illiterate and the less tech savy. This is the make or break movement for the country. Deep Regards

And who ever uses technology in wrong way and makes frauds are to be punished quickly and strongly. As like as gas bookings , cash withdrawals should happen, SMS booking for cash with drawl & allotment of slot, or else delivery of cash to home with paid service charge.
0 1 this is a very good decision for india becoming a cashless country.now we will use card instead of cash, but this is possible when bank give credit/debit cards to customer. just i want to give one example of myself, i.e- i am working in tata steel as a permanent employee since 2008,my gross salary is rs:36000/- , net salary is more than rs:25000/-, but state bank is refused to give me a credit card where my salary account in SBI since 2008. so plz take necessary action for cashless success

I believe your one word request can really change India.

0 1 Dear Sir, govts drive towards cashless economy is welcome. However, one is dismayed to notice that since the last few days, the laptops of Doordarshan newsreaders carry a logo of PayTM. Advertisements on DD TV is ok, but has it to be on the newsreaders laptops, which gives a misleading  impression of govt favouring one company ? The logo should be changed, may be with a govt or PSU advertisement.
0 1 Dear PM Sir, Even if I am the billionth person to do so, let me congratulate and thank you for the most decisive step to demonetise some currency notes. You have again very correctly taken the opportunity to encourage cashless transactions in the country. However, it is seen that stress is almost entirely on various digital modes of payment. Why ignore good old cheques ? Suitable measures to counter act cheque bounce should be taken to encourage cheque payments.
0 0 Modi Sir My Suggestion may not be relevant, but still i want to make it. This is regarding controlling black money. May not be much interesting, I request you to please check the attachment for more information. Jai Hind
0 1 Dear Sir, All Gov. Subsidies and Benefits should be made available in respective citizens bank Account Only .We should move towards abolishing the PDS system currently much of the benefits gets siphoned off.Make available gov Coupons of various denominations to pay gov. appointed third party contractors so that revenue generated is not siphoned off by them.Economically marginalized section could be encouraged to move towards digital transactions by offering cheap Life Insurance.
0 1 no need to tax sale of house again and again. it add cost to basic necessities. transfer cost of expensive car( crores) attract only 100/- while one lac house attract a duty of 6000/- plus other charges.....this is injustice
1 0 sir my suggestion are : Deposite all the money seized/confiscate back in banks for circulation. as of now money kept throughout India kept in  mal khanas of investigative agencies and lying idle and extra liability and staff to look after.(2nd idea)let the vehicle manufacture kept the sale/ownership data regarding each vehicle sold by them such as mobile phone sale/purchase is company/individual responsibility(3rd idea)incentivise the digital payment(4th idea) reduced the stamp duty to lowest.
0 1 Dear sir, I am a small businessman having small factory in Jamnagar. Let us form such a rule that richer person (with income of 15 thousand per month) can not transect in case except a few limit of cash, other below from that criteria have few more limit. In this regard we can bend in to cashless transaction.
0 0 dear sir, i am working in saudi arabia for the last 8 years....here in kingdom last year they made a declaration that all the mobile numbers are to be linked with finger print so that it will be more authentic and can be easily tracable.this can be done only through government certified agencies only.. why can't we make one such move in india sir? only people like you can do this...now it is very easy to get the sim cards in india for any one...appreciate your understanding in this regard..
0 1 Hello sir I write this because every office don't worry about the human life and human rights because office timing is above 10 hour or 11 hour a day...  Do something for human rights and that boy who want to study and job both in a day.  But however offices don't give holidays for exams and they give works 11 hour a day to us....

0 1 When we deposit any cheque to bank, we have to fill and attach respective bank's slip/challan along with the cheque. If we change the design of the cheque to include MICR of the bank (where the cheque will be deposited) and account number of the depositor, then there will be no need to attach anything else to the cheque. These newly added two fields will be filled up by depositor while depositing the cheque to his/her bank account. This will help reduce administrative efforts and save paper.

0 1 dear sir, it would be a great idea if you could provide JAN ANDROID MOBILE PHONE at very low cost for poor people of India and it should be linked to their JAN DHAN account. facility of emi from their account should be given to purchase these mobiles. Some good, gov app and user freindly for easily transaction should be installed. if these mobile can be issued from nationalised bank directly against the JAN DHAN addount no. then it would be better option. It will be a step for cashless India.

0 0 I have been tracelling from Mysore Border (Bavali) to Calicut, Kerala via Mananthavadi, Kalpetta, Narikkuni and then Calcut.  I approached many petrol pumps on way to fill fuel, using my debit card.  To my surprise, none was accepting debit card and want to do transaction in cash only.  In the interest of the people,  in the present situation,  all petrol pumps must accept plastic currency and not insist for cash.  Please look into this.  Last week, I talked to HP authorities too about it.
0 0 There is enough cash in country.As has been revealed in last couple of days where cores has been foind with criminals in new currency notes.As the cash is directly coming to banks so it is obvious banks are are helping thwm get there black money white.The best option is to stop supply of momey to banks.They can only deposit money but no withdrawals.Remove restriction from ATM withdrawal and ensure sufficient cash in all ATMs across the cointry.The problem will be resolved.
0 0 2-3 repeats of demonetization of high currency notes after every 5-7 years and cash currency tax on cash withdrawals will reduce tendency to hold cash in high currency notes. Young teachers of cashless transactions will get cash incentives. If their students ID one of them and use the technology for next 3.5 years & avail (subsidy/gift of 5%) stipulated benefits, the teacher will get that (10%of students benefit) incentive.
0 0 People require small denomination cash rather than discounts for usage of Cards. What is todays basic requirement is some small cash. Hence, please enable shop owners to offer some small cash (whatever small amount, it may be) with every card transaction. Please give choice/ freedom to shop owners to enable them to issue some cash in percentage of their choice for every Transaction made on card as if they are purchasing some cash. don't put tax on cash. with this DEMONETISATION will successfull

0 0 Respected Friends, Name : e-vehicle Licence plate (eVLP). what is it : As the name suggests, it is electronic number plate for each vehicle. Technically it is a "passive RF tag" meaning does not require battery or power supply. It has all the information of registration in its memory. Applications : Payment of tolls, eVLP readers at toll booth, can auto debit the account. eVLP readers can track a vehicle. etc. More details in attached file.
0 0 Transactions in cash above Rs 500 will have triple tax, & will not get any protection under consumer or any relevant Acts. Every cash withdrawal will attract 1% cash currency tax on amount (in Rs 10 & 20 notes), 3% cash currency tax on amount (in Rs 50 & 100 notes) & 5% cash currency tax on amount (in Rs 500 & 2000 notes). It will reduce cash transactions Even in higher denominations.
0 0 Govt should encourage cashless transactions by providing transactions tax free & without any bank charges for next 6 months and additionally with subsidy/gift of 5%(on spent amount in 6 months, caped by 100 to 200 transactions pm & subsidy amount Rs 400 to 800 pm) credited to his account after 3.5 years if the user continues to remain cashless for his 95% amount transacted in those 3.5 years. It will monetarily encourage people to go cashless & habituate them to be cashless for next 4 years.
0 0 To encourage cashless transactions there is nothing better than incentives like discount and money-back into Aadhar accounts. Deposit a small amount of money in BPL Aadhar accounts. The measures announced by FM are good but not sufficient to create a buzz or enthusiasm.

1 0 It seems that some people in banks and ATM refilling companies have enjoyed a lot by exchanging huge currency rather than filling in ATMs. Audit is required, for cash provided for ATMs and public, how much was distributed to whom. This is how people got success in exchanging almost all the black money. Strong actions against such persons can help in maintaining trust of common man that this action was for good and it is not a failure.
0 0 Pranam, This is regarding stopping black money in economy. This is possible by only 2 ways 1) make universal card and all payments digital and remove all coins and cash from the country 2) have cash. But make pan or Adhar mandatory for every transaction for more than 10k like to buy car fridge bike etc anything more than 10k and for more than 6 transactions under 10k and more than 1k per month this way every huge fish is caught.
0 0 Respected Honourable Prime Minister of India Sir, Sub.: Open jail concept for normal punished prisoners – Reg. It is for your kind notice that, the normal punished prisoners may kept in the Open Jails(i.e. in the normal society)  to reduce financial load on the Government / the public and increase the productivity. The punishment is possible at outside jail also. Cutting subsides, ban on travelling by train / flight / bus , Driving licence ban and many more also possible through UID and / Chip
0 0 Banks should be instructed to ensure all ATM are supplied with cash on a daily basis. Whatever cash is made available to different branches of the banks, first priority to be given to fill cash in all ATMs daily. This will ensure even distribution of csh to real needy and improve general perception. Will obviate bad media publicity. Ensure all ATMs get daily quota of cash. This is not happening. Bigger amount can be transacted electronically.
1 0 Media, both electronic and print should also spread awareness of the benefits of going digital both for the individual and also for the nation like eradication or reduction in corruption, the transparency that can be achieved in financial transactions that will help in reducing black money to a large extent and in the long run, it will help in stopping or reducing circulation of counterfeit currency to a large extent.
2 0 Sir, create a website which gives complete information about outlets having e-payment facility. Which will be great help for public to move towards cashless environment.

1 0 This is for reservation system. All the ST SC student whose parents are first grade Govt employee, should be out from reservation system. Because now thay are not backward. Now poor ST SC student are still live on footpath even they have no money to buy books and rich St SC are taking coaching class for competitive exam. So these poor students have more opportunities for Govt.job and as soon as they get job their reservation criteria removed. And one day there is no need for reservation.
0 0 Continuing from where i had left, i also would like to suggest that electronic media and print media should participate and play a great role in spreading awareness in the public about the need to make India a digital and less cash economy. Media should play a very important role in creating a positive response and active participation by citizens to achieve this goal. Electronic media should advertise the availability of products that are available which are safe, secure and easy to use.

0 0 the views which are in nation interest attached with this post.
1 0 The role it plays on eradicating or reducing corruption must also be highlighted to them. The importance of the need to make India a digital economy needs to be spread among the masses,specially the daily wage sections of people, traders, businessmen,etc. Citizens need to be educated on how to use mobile and other applications to make digital transactions.
0 0 I believe that it is a great idea and it is very much possible to make India a digital economy. To begin with, the poorer and the uneducated must be made digital literate by creating awareness about the need to make India a digital economy. The benefits of going digital should be first highlighted to them and convince them that it is safe, secure and easy. The positive impact it has on economy and their lives must be conveyed to them.
0 1 Dear Sir , We should use all excess money to All India BAN on alchol , tobacoo ,products for next four years and state revenue loss can be taken by central Gov for next 4 years in between they can find alternative resource for income ,  this will give a lots of good wishes to our Prime minister sir and team at least from all poor people.
0 0 Digital literacy and using digital platform are the best tools/method to fight against corruption. In this way I feel that farmers, poor people, rural population, small business men, small entrepreneurs are more victim of corruption since long time. They suffer for a small loan from banking system to avail small loan like KCC, CC for business etc. and ultimately take help of middle man. ............ see the attachment.
1 0 Dear Sir, Demonetisation of old Rs.500 and Rs.1000 notes is very good decision to make our country without corruption. My suggestion is about that is want to implement all transactions should be digital payment (Debit and Credit Card / Net banking) in all private agencies like schools and colleges, etc.,
1 0 Dear Sir, It's a very good decision to make our society cashless, but this should be implemented first then it should be followed by Demonetisation. Even it's not too late, the big merchants and organisations in each and every sector should be directed to accept only Digital Transactions. Also, Gov. Organisation and banks should not impose any transaction charges for digital payment including IRCTC. Only waving of transaction charges would be enough to promote digital transaction.
1 0 if we want to India be a cashless India, we have to take strict steps towards all shopkeepers/businessmen & anyone who is selling or giving services to public should have. first of all we have  to digitized all govt distribution center i.e Seeds distribution center, Rashan Shops, all departments where the public dealing is happening.

All think that it would droop down our GDP but it forn a less time.The idea made some what difficult for the money to get in liquid but for the growth it is necessary. At point to frmrs its the major problem for having money in hand. Making it online makes the growth in every aspect.It develops the financial inclusion through opening bank accounts
0 0 Dear Sir, we are working with villagers to move to plastic currency.

The rest of the villages in the Taluk can also move provided there are enough banks spread.   Please help

0 1 Dear  PM My suggestion is to start m-wallet SIM(mobile wallet SIM) where SIM is linked with  new bank account no .These SIMs are available at retail shop/at banks.Debit cards are to be given with these SIMs.When money is transferred to another person SIM,instead of account no,his name is displayed so shopkeeper is to be easy who has given him money.Company give sms to the person for day to day transaction so shopkeeper are easy to track income and expenditure for the day.
2 0 Hello sir, On the topic of cashless transaction. I would like to suggest finger print system for payment. Right now jio sim are issued based on finger print scanner which collect our data from adhaar card. By using the same technology one could pay the daily expense as adhaar card is already link to his bank account. So by introducing this we don't have go for card payment. Of course this idea need to some enhancement like adding an additional authentication like request pin no as well.
2 0 Respected Sir, On the way of Cashless Society the main difficulty is cyber crime and charges levied by POS machine on each swipe, which is not acceptable by a shopkeeper. In my view, e-wallet can become a good way for keeping foundation for cashless society. Now a day each bank is having its e-wallet which is being used by its customer only. Imagine if register user of one bank e-wallet will be allowed to pay other banks e-wallet, the difficulty will move away. Plz make it possible with NPCI
1 0 I dream of a country where I can leave without touching the things used in performing crime. We always try to avoid criminal and never touch the things suspected as criminal's things. I Then why we are forced to touch the paper notes used by the criminal in performing dangerous crime as kidnappings, murders, militant activities,,,. So I request my Govt to gift me a society where I can spend my days without touching the things used by the criminal. So gift me a cashless society.
2 0 Sir , I request you to start railway counter to have debit card/ credit card swapping machines for reservation and for oncounter transactions. It will reduce a huge cash transaction. Sir u also do it for payments of all govt taxes. Plastic rupia... Devloping India
1 0 Dear PMO It would be beneficial if the public could pay court fee and police spot fines through electronic transfer such as credit or debit card and payment services like freecharge and paytm. This will help them in times like this. If the honorable PM could make an announcement on this regard it will be helpful for the public and allow police forces to purchase the technology requirements as soon as possible. Thank you
1 0 Sir we are proud of you please make leader's  like you in other states aso that we will thankful for this.
0 0 Standardized-APP is must and may solve the queue problems within 1 or 2 days, APP software should be given to the respective Banks and they may validate the A/C nos. and on first validations sum of cashless credits 2000 should be given to each customer now we may promote it like hotcake e.g Paytm or any govt. APP, after registration on the APP (standardized) it was very easy to handle the transactions for the 60% of the people and other 40% people may queue for the cash in Bank.
0 0 Main problem Regarding cashless online Transactions- sir, online payment systems are not standardized like our currency notes this is the main problem as we use the same currency note all over the world without any fear of validation/invalidation but online payment modules are not like this Paytm is neccessary for Paytm and same is the scenario for all the transactions. so some intermediate gateway of payment is necessary to make payment independent of the application used for the trransaction
0 0 Dear PM, One of the major problem associated with Debit card, credit card or online payment is about its security. Govt can ask the banks to issue prepaid card system, which can be used as wallet. The cost and speed of internet is major problem associated with e-wallet like paytm. Sir, I only suggest that people should use technology with adequate security.
0 0 Dear PM Can you please make minimum rent amount for all commercial property rent, either it is new tenant or old. Because old rented property have less rent compare to new rental property. Because of this old rent, business owner does not show an actual business. And it makes big loss of tax for government of India. Is it possible to decide minimum rental price as per Jantri rates.
0 0 Sh.Modi Ji, To teach and encourage the people who stay in villages, We can introduce cashless transaction methods in ration stores.

2 0 Dear Sir, One of the major impediments in national development is our dependency on foreign companies for hardware components. Can the government invest resources and materialise the indigenous development and manufacturing of chips, processors for computers and mobiles? Increase in indigenous production of many small value electronic items for diverse applications will be a direct side-effect of this development and will help reduce the digital divide in our country. Regards, Apurba.

3 0 Dear PM Move towards cashless is a great move towards eradicating black money. Now to give shape to this mission, we need a solid action plan. Encouraging through radio and TV for going digital may not yield enough confidence unless we physically demonstrate, how simple it is to digital illiterate or semi-literate.  Suggest to show in TV a demo, how to create a digital wallet and then how to do the transaction through this wallet. Will help in generating confidence among the common mass.
2 0 Respected PM, There are many house-owners across different locations in the country who do the one or more of the following malpractices:They give their house(s) on rent, but do not share their PAN with the tenant. They force the tenant to pay the rent only in cash. Even if they file IT returns, they under-report / do not report this rental income and hence do not pay any income tax on that. What can we do to stop these malpractices ? Make stricter laws and enforce them. Thanks !

0 0 Dear Sir, Happy with push to"less Cash" society. Trying to pay small vendors and housemaids without success. The issue is they haven't enabled mobile banking. So can not receive funds through UPI apps like TruePay, PhonePe etc. Suggestion (1) Provide single UPI app across all banks. It is confusing with many UPI apps (2) Auto-enable all accounts seeded with mobile number for fund receipt through mobile banking (3)Provide default bank option if multiple bank accounts exist
0 0 Dear PM, as there are mobile rechaging centers, there should be "e walate " recharging centers (under direct control of various banks)So that there is no need to go to bank web site.people can deposit 2000 rs note and payfor PAYTM Mobile number be the unique identity of transact The centers can be opened in bank for the account holders, which can provide recharge of e walate up to rs 20000 per mth by taking cheques. This will avoid apprehension in public mind about hacking of bank account.

0 0 Dear Sir, You are the one person who made all the world to see India.  I am as an Bank Officer supporting people and leading my people towards serving Nation.  I want to give small idea which will help towards cashless.  First of all, we need to change Govt organisations which are transacting through cash only.  Eg.Registrations, Electricity Bills (more than Rs.500/-) and Municipal Taxes and Govt.Taxes more than Rs.500/-.  These all can be happened just through one app (E collect account).
0 0 I have a generic query not related to this forum. As news channels are highlighting as critical issue of cash crunch, where as actually there is no cash crunch. You can find all new Rs2000.00 notes are seized from either builders, relatives of ministers, businessman, doctors that to 2000 crores or 3000 crores. My query is - Why there is no rigorous punishment for such people ? How long this liberal process will continue ? No one is feeling shame for his/her deeds because of so much liberal !!!
2 0 There should be an app which will send alert to nearby police stations as well as respective minister. Example: Engg. college management is approaching for donation (in cash) then student should fill few details like college name, few names from management, college location etc in the app then app should alert one message to near by police station, another message to district head quarter and final message to education minister. Few other examples:bribe in govt offices, violence by local goons.
0 0 Demonetization is indeed excellent step to curb black money. I stay in Gurgaon and did not face any difficulty. But news channels are showing very difficult situation (although as I know, it would be true for 10-20%) only, but need to handle the situation to normalise at earliest. Actually, whatever currency being printed is getting stuck and not returning to banks causing the blockage. there is sensible authorities being appointed in every village to tell about cashless transaction
0 0 Dear Modi ji Namaskar.i want to draw your attention  that Govt  Promoting cashless  transfer but lot of people still having fear of cyber frauds. When  I argued with  them they were  giving  me example  of USA and how govt bear all the losses  because of cyber fraud. My request  to my Govt.is that please give assurance to the people  how safe is online  fund transfer. The other thing is ensure net avalibilty at affordable  price for poor people  and abolish transaction charges to encourage
0 0 The depleting forest cover is a matter of great concern. This has led to significant change in the weather pattern, habitat destruction, and pollution. The quality of life is being affected. It is a bare fact that increasing population is a big drain on the resources and directly hits the environment. Development and environment, however, are complementary to each other and must go hand in hand. Development at the cost of forests and environment must be a big NO.
1 0 R/PM Modiji,I am proud of you for clearing India by demonetization.I am a BSF soldier.It is constrained to inform that more than 35% of BSF trained soldiers r deployed in the residences of GO's despite drawing Security Aid allwcs which cannot be resisted by anyone for many years.IB can be strengthen if restoration of these trained soldiers from their residences so that India would be more secured from LOC.Thank u for not disclosing my identity and giving opportunity to submit man ki bath.
2 0 I SUGGEST THE GOVERNMENT TO REMOVE PENSION SCHEME FOR MPs/MLAs AND SPECIFICALLY CUT THE SALARY OF THE MPs/MLAs FOR THE DAY WHENEVER THEY did not let the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha work
2 0 Sir one more thing I need to say. Major field that can convert black money to white money is film industry. they can show fake collection reports with the help of theatre owners. by that way black money can convert to white. please view those areas also.  Black money is every where
2 2 Respected Modiji demonetisation was good step.Black money cant eliminate completely with this step.Many guilty people are invested black money in gold and land and by using benami. U should do surgical strikes on them also. And after that we should seize black money abroad.  keep going step by step. Hoping good results
2 0 Respected Modiji as per report within December all old notes will be returned.Its clear that Black money are deposited through some ways. In this circumstance its clear that corrupted bank officers played role in that. Sir if this step has to be successful all accounts should be checked and should punish bank officers who are guilty.dont suspend them just dismiss them.if black money is not seized through this step,opposition will raise this as their correct assumptions.
0 0 I request to Hon. Prime minister to take strict actions against the members of parliament who are creating obstacle for discussion by creating chaos. I request to terminate each and every person who is trying to slow down the growth of progress of India by not ‘working’ in parliament.
0 0 Looking forward for mangalore to be smart city than bangalore
0 0 Thank you sir for cleaning India by Demonetization. We all trust you - take your time, hit hard and make it worth of everything. no hurry. even if takes next 2 years. sir make sure that cashless economy at least starts from these move. PROUD OF YOU.
0 0 HI, I was going through an article and strongly feel about implementation of this idea- We need a law to Streamline the Rules. I think this is really need of the hour. http://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/we-need-a-law-to-streamline-the-ru...
0 0 Over 40000 SHAKHAS OF RSS spread out over India, SWAYAM SEVAKS should initiate process of teaching people use of phones for digital transactions. Bharat mata ki Jai!
0 0 Banks not supporting Citizens with Pradhan mantri schemes of Rs12 and Rs 330. They are not giving application forms and not giving certificates. They are saying these schemes have failed and hence discontinued by government. Indeed many people did not get certificates. Intervention is requested please as banks seem to be misleading people. Also please start toll free customer care for such schemes.
0 0 dear sir, as you had  taken wonderful steps toward black money by demonetization of big currency. yet there are various side effect of this step. one issue is the paying in the hospital, they ask for cash ,and bank doesn't give the enough cash. many banks give 2000 or 4000, which is not sufficient. so there should be a debit card  swipe machine in each hospitals even in rural areas, for payment . as we all need cashless economy. thank you
1 0 House Rentals - Dear Sir, your actions towards eliminating black money or unaccounted money is commendable. Now we see all consumers are going towards digital payments. This sector is one where most of the owners won’t share their details like Bank A/C, PAN details and they accept only cash (with No Receipt) and now they even demanding smaller (100/-) denominations as they don’t want to reach the bank for their needs. Please regularize this RENTAL sector and make owners are accountable.
0 0 Dear sir I would like to suggest that all societies bungalow  building commercial any should have a (DUSTBIN)  outside their gates for common public  on the road maintained by them selves, should  be  made  compulsory  along  with camera security all  over  India.. this  certainly  will  help  Swach Bharat program  also all  traffic signal  should  be  provided  with  dustbin  which can  be  either  sponsored  by  multinational or  municipality for advertisement.#SmartIndiaHackathon2017, #MyGov
0 0 All educational institutions and hospitals (where 99% tax evasions are going on) should be made cashless. All shops especially all medical shops should give us any mode of cashless facility soon. All self employed, businessman should provide any mode of cashless payment system to his/her customers including rickshawas and grocery shops..
0 0 A good step to start with but it will be good if such ideas are worked upon and students are provided with all kind of help so that these ideas can become a reality...
0 0 Dear Sir Very soon we are going to be in a great need of very strong employment policies. Make in India is one out of many of your indeginious steps. That step can be modified to curb the upcoming problem of unemployment. Demonetisation your bold step will search and attack many black businesses Thus(employers and employees will have to find another jobs) If they can be part of make in India or similar policy they can contribute their dirty brain in the progress of country. JAI HIND
0 0 Dear Hon'ble Modi Sir, I like to provide my suggestion regarding Electricity generation. Can't in India we produce Electricity from Sea Water as like Middle East Countries, also we can use more soloar systems,atleast in metropolitan area, which will save our cost. India is surrounded by sea & rivers so it will be best option & also it will provide electricity in many parts. India is blessed with all nature & we should make its proper use. I hope I able to put my views properly. Thank You.
0 0 In almost all shops (except supermarkets) there is a board hanging which says " 1000/- and old 500/- rupees are not accepted) from Nov 9th onwards.... actually there should be other boards lik "we accept cashless payment here" Common man cant go to supermarkets always to use pos machines. Recently i went to supermarket as i can use card there instead of cash, but there,the same quality of rice that i used to pusrcase at rs. 33/- is 60/-per kg. A vast difference is many products lik this.
1 0 namaskar..i request the honourable prime minister to consider my suggestion to implement the system of smart money or say plastic money to the following trade fields exclusively..no cash transactions to be carried out in the following trade fields..petrol pumps, shopping malls, railway stations and transport means, mobile recharges and other essential daily life trade fields..this will help people to get used to plastic money..please put a deadline after which cash would not be accepted in above
1 0 Please make lpg gas agency, all railway station ticket counter and such places cashless. People can arrange cash for vegetables but where more money is required where to bring cash. Keeping aside shopping places, atleast make gas agency like places cashless.
0 0 Dear sir, i am seeing that you are promoting cashless economy. People doubt about it still. I dont have doubt. Nothing is impossible , only proper planning is needed. My point of view is that please make govt / semi govt transaction cashless. Infuse more cash in villages. Promote more cashless options in cities like encouraging banks to provide swipe machines, also lowering charges on swipe machine.. I m still cash not avialable in almost all atm. Why gas agency are still asking for cash.
1 0 Today after many days I went to the Sadar Bazar and found more than 50% of shopkeepers have installed facilities for cashless transaction. Even the revedi / mudngfalliwala shops have paytm facilities for cashless transaction.It is good to have cashless transactions but won't it be better to reduce transaction charges as they were levied when cards were luxury , but now if we are proceeding towards cashless economy this barrier should end and people should be encouraged with some incentives.
0 0 without enforcing civic sense we can't think better place to live even in the world.SMART INDIA App can control the field problems/ corruption in Transport, cleanliness,hospitals,offices etc. I have a Blue print which can create lot of employment and transparency so that corrupt employees / citizens can be punished and the fear of punishment with proof can correct the system. Input by volunteers through camera/phone can be monitored by the control room officer and corrective measure can be done
1 0 Dear Sir Pl make card swiping is compulsory for all trade license holders...thanks
0 0 Dear Prime Minister, After announcing demonetization, for some days position of cash availability in banks to the public was not good. Now the situation has improved to some extent. Banks are loading ATMs with cash daily once and same gets exhausted within 2 to 3 hours. After that banks display 'NO CASH' boards in ATMs. If the banks can load ATMs with cash two or three times a day, probably all people will get cash at any time without waiting in long ques.Kindly instruct the banks suitably.
0 0 Dear Sir, We want you to order a CBI inquiry about the "Apollo game" in chennai in Jayalalitha's case.From whom apollo hospital was taking orders? All top leaders went to meet Jayalalitha in apollo must reveal what exactly they saw. All of them came back without even seeing her.Are we living in a democratic country? CM of a state was hidden from public in a hospital for 70+ days and not even a single pic/video about her condition was released till her death and central didn't take it serious?
0 0 Dear PM, I would like to request for a change in the way the current ATM machines are operating. Currently, the ATMs from different banks are working different process flow such that it makes difficult and time consuming for an individual to withdraw the money. Adding to this, some banks are using this as an opportunity to advertise about loans and similar. I would like to request on the possibility of making the screen messages standard such that it will be easy for all the individuals.
0 0 Sir,I think demonetisation has given upper hand to certain business and businessmen,after demonetisation, we as public are bound to use methods like e-wallet but companies like paytm are taking advantages of people and doing fraud, they are doing their monopoly and despite of every attempt reach their customer care it's all in vain.....they did fraud to.me  for 1000/- rs, please keep a check on paytm sir there are many who suffered by paytm...it's all mentioned in consumer forums
0 0 Sir, Iam watching since many days the local sweepers are burning the collected waste which includes plastics, paper, etc which leads to toxic gases, damaging our respiratory system.

2 0 Dear Mr.Narendra Modi Gi, I like to share the idea regarding the LPG domestic cylinder, the delivery boys are collecting extra money from us and sometimes they are selling our cylinder in black by not delivering us. Therefore, I request you to collect the money from our bank account directly or implement a swiping machine. Secondly, also issue a card instead of gas book, that should be linked to delivery. ..

I want to say that sarpanch of the village take a huge money from govt grants but spend only 10 to 20 percent on village development. what he do with all money? Pls stop that money and give this to a private developers for actual development. we see nothing development even after long time.
1 0 Dear PM Sir, The biggest concern is about the online fraud....we don't have the strong ..Cyber Security and Anti Hacking Policy ... if we want to show the world that we are the first country of cashless.. Government must think to make a strong policy on anti hacking and online fraud .If we are going for cashless economy.currently it is so sad that no one discussing on it... PM need to think.. that why i had put the direct question to you sir. Your view point please think over it.
0 1 Respected Sir, JaiHind Subject: Some suggestions to reduce increasing rape cases Sir, Due to words limit.  I m presenting my views in short. Internet porn sites shud be banned.  No jail no death punishment.   Just cutting pf hands and feet in front of public.  So victim shid suffer with same mental and physical torture which they had given to an innocent.  Especially girl rapists n gang rapists.   A bit freedom shud also be given so there shud not arise any need
0 0 Dear Hon'ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji, Sir, Good Morning ,In 2017, let's hope positive that all the villages, will be  digitally connected...may our talented youth come forward to make this Dream true...particularly the panchayaths, municipality, corporations all have to be connected digitally.. so the corporation taxes, water tax, electricity... may be paid on line... people should not become tired...

1 0 Dear sir to decrese the high floatinng at tollgates and fecilitate easy wending of tickets....i have small suggestion 1. as we know that each vehicle's registration number is unique so better use barcode should be sticked on the number plate and with help of high lense camera barcode will be scanned instead of capturing the photo of number plate. 2. barcode of vehicle number also help to find out the missed vehicle information and also to catch the radicles/thieves/ anti social elements.
0 0 Black money holders are exchanging 1000 rupee notes to 500 notes from the banks and they are getting running currency from railway station,bus station and from toll plaza etc and so they are dumping the running currency as black money in the banks.500 rupee notes are being deposited in bank and their is no flow of running currency.In bus, railway station and toll plaza etc they are not accepting 500 rupee notes from the public,so stop use of 500 rupee notes and running currency will come to bank
0 0 Being a banker of with knowledge of digital banking, I would like to share my experiences and educate people on digital banking for smoother functioning of their day to day expenses without cash. Specially rural population where this becomes very important due unawareness of digital banking and cashless modes.. Would request concerned to gives us an opportunity to serve nation at my best and support digital campaign..
0 0 For speedy shifting of cash to cashless society it is advisable to provide POS at micro level i.e. Subji Wala, Taxi Wala, Auto Rickshaw wala, small food vendors, consulting doctors etc at free/ concessional rates. Right now they are not eligible for POS. Instruct RBI to pass order to banks for an immediate implementation
0 0 Good Evening PM Modi , Digital India , is one process under all indians will come under one shelter .we believe in our people , so we have to help them . Like all small shopkippers , or those who sale their product on street also  didnt have swipe card machines or they not use to smart phone . So through help of no. Banks we can start to give knowledge as well as distrubution of swipe machine in large no.becaz this way of payment is more faithful rather than any one .
0 0 Make online payment less costly in RAILWAY  than offline (counter ticket).....because large no of public is attached to it ......or to permote cashless transaction ......
0 0 ntrospection is important for all Indians.India is going to the dogs because most of our countrymen do not have community feeling.They discriminate eachother on the basis of their caste and religion.Promotion of nationalism and unity is the most important and above all other things.Exceptions are also there.
0 0 India would be smart only when it is 100% digital and cashless.When there are no ques,no corruption,no undue profiteering,no discrimination on the basis of caste,creed or religion.When there are only two or three political parties like US and UK.When politics become a medium of public service not money spinning business.When there is retirement age for all politicians.India would become smart when no dowry system.,no discrimination on the basis of male, female, India is a welfare state.
0 0 To make cashless India government should make zero transaction charge via paytm ewallet MasterCard debit card etc.#mygovt #narendramodi
0 0 What are the future implications when India adopt total technological aspects? Is its dangers for employability for others? Mostly Job in technological feild?
0 0 Dear PM ,Demonatisation is one of the greatest bold step taken by anyone in India. We are with you whole heartly. But some of the bugers who are mostly affected by this move are creating unnecessary rucks and distrubing the sessions of Parliament. Why not like labours laws if there is no work there is no pay applicable to parliament session also. After all they are paid bcoz we pay tax and we don't want some jokers creating hurdles in countries progressive path.
0 0 Cashless atmosphere: Pls tell all banks to enable mobilebanking/ netbanking feature for all category of accounts in India. Banks keeps this control for lower category accounts. Banks expects very minor service charge for this ! It is It is first and mandatory step to make cashless atmosphere..If u not did by your uniform policy/ order to banks. Banks will initiate complicated procedure for public. In this situation public will started to run away from being cashless. Movement.
0 0 For Hackathon 2017 only college students can participate.  Experienced Persons & Professionals who are justifiably better placed to Identify Potential Needs, Limitations and Security Concerns can be included in a sub competition for HACKATHON IDEAS. The topics of the main competion could either own or from subjects from the subcompetion. The IDEAs behind the program are more important than the actual programming itself. Also issues of Securty, Emergency Issues and Data Backup on Indian soil.
0 0 The tax on alcohol and the drugs would be done the double so that the people cannot afford it
0 0 Honourable prime minister I wanted to say that you should take some steps to impose the same rate of tax in every field which will be better for the poor and middle class as if 5% so that your dream of cashless India can come true.or may be the product is sold at the Indian market at mrp inclusive of all taxes
0 0 Nice steps to curve black money. Give salary in cash to government employees to circulate new currency notes easily.
0 0 Dear PM Ji!.   Congratulations for your bold step on demonitisation.   Further about monies deposited in Jan Dan SB a/cs to the tune of R. 75000/- crores, my suggestion will be please make it compulsory to get IT clearance for withdrawals from all suspicious accounts.   This will solve and reduce the work burden of IT dept.   Wish the scheme to become all success.
0 0 Sir, To digitiza india it is necessary to educate people about it. Bur now a days due to demonitization, it is necessary to provide some easy platform for cashless india. There should be some app/Waller which is connected directly to our mobile number. This wallet can be recharged from credit/debit card/internet banking/E mitra. Then a code is provided for every person/ merchant. Then only by SMS in specific form payment can be done to merchant who r connected through it.
0 0 To add to my comment earlier, Aforestation of the complete stretch of the highways can be a part of the contract with the companies developing the stretch of the highway. Suggestion would be to include this clause as part of the contract with the companies for all new projects coming up. The existing highways can be either given to the companies maintaining it currently or reputed / interested NGOs in a particular state
0 0 Dear Hon'ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji, Sir, Good Morning and have a nice beginning of the day ! and have a good day to all with Thanks !! Smart India Hackathon 2017 is a good innovative and a part of intellectual thinking   this will give a good result to our nation  India ! With this hope lets begin the day !
0 0 Namaste P.M. , I know this is not relevant to the title, but still like 2 share,there should be only three types of reservations 1. Economical Backward Class 2. Adiwasi Kalyan 3. State Level Rest all to be open , This black money exposure can help us to restructuring reservation system point by point, if we will be able to track the family income somehow , we will be able to find the economic condition of that family to literate their kids , so where we can stop giving them reservation.
0 0 Can only college goers participate in this innovate.mygov and hackathons and not the general public and professionals?
0 0 Today a large number of youth despite being well qualified/skilled, are running from pillar to post for the JOBS/EMPLOYMENT. Unemployed youth take to gossiping and become an obstacle in nation's social/political/economic progress. An App that actually registers the number of Employment opportunities created vis a vis number of Unemployed Youths growing in the country; An App to invite ideas as to how to employ men and women on a mass scale industries in this regard, like China Model.
2 0 Dear Sir, Considering the lack of rains and pollution, there is an urgent need to have more trees. The road divider on the thousands of KMs or highways, can be used to plant crores of trees helping the environment plus adding beauty and shade to the roads along with water retention capacity and significant reduction of carbon foot print in the air. The situation is getting out of control and has to be addressed on SOS basis.
0 0 I feel to put governance in everybody's reach,the way must be easy and accessible.And Internet is a such big source to connect everybody.But problem is more than 60% of population don't use internet and those using of them many are not educated.So they don't recognize the benefits of internet. We need to educate people before making India digital.Since much of our population still lives in rural areas.Some Effective government centres need to be opened there which might help.
1 1 I know a tea vendor, who is selling T worth Rs 10000 daily, but he says he cannot go digital, because he has to pay rent of the space which is approx Rs 80000/- in cash only. His owner is a big shot who does not accept check and thus make this black money. How is govt going to tackle such situation?
0 0 This can even be taken upto united nations whereF Fundamental Rights of Children can be included in the UN charter so that the policies made by different nations include them. For eg. Africa is going through a demographic change and its population is increasing at a very faster rate and slowly they will come to a situation where the mouths increase the resources, a sort of irreversible situation. The first casualty of poverty are the children.
1 0 Fundamental Rights of Children: All Children till the age of 16 shall be the responsibility of the Govt.. If any child cannot take care of himself due to poverty, abusive parents etc shall be given care in the form of food, education and other things important for the growth of a child. By defining the fundamental rights of a children for 1 generation of 36 years we can eliminate plenty of future criminals and other abusers. The fundamental right of children is very very important.
0 0 Any person who claims himself to be god loving can find his god begging on the streets, working in tea shops, not having proper care to be taken off. This crime and great sin is being committed right in front of our eyes in great daylight and we are as considering ourselves civilized people do nothing. The child exploitation & torture goes a long way in shaping his or her personality and they most of them become the future criminals and themselves the perpetrators of heinous crimes.
0 0 The children who do not get affection, education basic resources and are leading an impoverished life is the greatest sin we are collectively doing against the humanity. See the children on the traffic signals begging for 2 rs or 4 rs. is the live example of this great sin. They are brought to this world by their irresponsible poor parents in hope that they will see their conditions improvising but what happens is the opposite, the more the children they have the more the resources gets divided
1 0 Inhuman Condition of poor childrens is a crime against humanity The population of India has risen above the explosive stage. Any steps taken to curb poverty will result in failure if the population which is  Resources/ Population doesn’t gets controlled. The main victims and suferers of this population growth are the children of India, Children are considered as the face of God in the earth and bringing them to this world without having enough resources is a deep rooted sin against humanity.
0 0 Respected Prime Minister, there is a huge problem....STRAY ANIMALS. Please help us both.
2 0 SIR AS A YOUNG STUDENT I GIVE YOU A SUGGESTION THAT ,MOST OF THE PEOPLE OF OUR NATION HAVENT HAD A) FINANCIAL LITERACY,B)AGRICULTURE  LITERACY. 1)I BEEING A STUDENT NGO,I REQUEST YOU START A HEALTHY COMPETITION AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS BY TELLING THEM TO ADOPT A VILLAGE & PROVIDE KNOWLEDGE ON NATURAL FARMING & FINANCIAL LITERACY AMONG VILLAGERS BY COLLEGE STUDENTS. 2)YOU AWARD THOSE COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO CHANGED TO DIGITAL,NATURAL&FARMING VILLAGE100%. 3)SO THAT IT USEFUL TO STUDENTS ALROUND DOV.
0 0 Lot of workers in organized and unorganized sector work under various departments, PSUs institutions of government. Government may ask all these organizations to depute one or more suitable persons on voluntary basis as technology coordinators who apart from their regular duties are willing to teach every one in their area how to use e-wallet or UPI for cash less transactions. This shall be particularly useful for people who are near the bottom of hierarchy and contractual workers.
0 0 We can promote digitization in India only when it provides an integrated approach to the various initiatives taken by the government, so that they work in tandem to provide benefit to the people of this country. For example, we can integrate the current banking network with the UIDAI linked Aadhar Card and use the demonetization initiative currently taken up by the government to plan, implement and fund a social insurance scheme for each and every Indian. One such plan has been sent to PMO.
0 0 Sir, This is for "ministry of power" Our india producing lakhs of engineers but at the same time lakhs of unemployemet I have small idea for that unemployement Please getrid of these power distribution from the governament Make it as disrtibutive allow private companies same as genereation Then no need of pays lakhs of rupees to AEs same cost you can provide min 3 posts and save the public money...
0 0 Dear Prime Minister, You are giving a great service to the nation. Small suggestion. Please distribute tokens to the people who are standing in Queues outside ATMs and in Banks. Simple token is to put a date stamp on small piece of paper and write number. Many people lost their lives because of standing in queues. This small measure will make a positive difference. Regards, Shrirang

0 0 Now is the right time to launch JAN ANDOLAN(like Swatchh Bharat) to educate the masses the technique of using smart phones to create cashless society as under; -E cash transfers, downloading apps,booking tickets,also WhatsApp, Twitter & Skype. Venue could be schools/classrooms. A small fee could be charged for the purpose.
0 0 as per the required licences the documents required portal will open. The licensee have to just upload the documents and a date is given for verification of documents .A deadline of issuing of licences will be given like passport registration and if the required licences are not given by the licencing authority will be answerable for this.Sir my 90% of starting capital,1.5ys (time) was wasted under table. kindly look into this mater seriously the pain of Indian  youth    .
0 0 Happy Morning Dear Mr Modiji .Now the core topic of my is "making a digital green environment for business".I don't have any idea about GST. Now i would like to tell the problem arising to start a business.If anybody want to start a business he have to take a several type of licences from different departments of state and central government and the 90% of the documents are almost same. kindle make one portal and have a choice to the business men to select the required licennces .
2 0 Hello Modi Sir I am extremely happy that you are our prime minister.  I want to see you as my lifetime prime minister. Sur,  i have a few suggestions. 1-  All government offices should be made mandatory to collect cash through PoS. 2. I see that in practical life,  government is not promoting solar energy.  Solar panels are too costly.  Solar loans should be promoted. 3. Pls introduce PoS reduction offer so that even very small shop keepers or even taxi drivers can afford it.
1 0 Why isn't India going Solar? If the Govt supports Solar energy the cost solar panels will automatically reduce. Solar panels should be installed on rooftops of 100%buildings of India,be it govt or Pvt. Mass production will bring down costs.
