1 0 Shri Narendrabhai, Diwali has lost its charm due to many cultural invasions. A festival where Hindu Calendar year ends. Many formalities were attached with these days as it was year ending for markets and New year for all. March ending system brought chopda pujan to a mockery and tight school vacation holidays forced many parents to fly away from families for leisure trips rather than being with the family members and relatives to really celebrate the festival. some strategic approach can mak

How will you deal with Pakistan for final time
0 0 Respected Modi Sir,I feel that today we need smart villages if we want to improve lifestyle of 70 percent people.I feel that some of gov industries or private industries should be mobilised or erected in rural areas.also technical edu institutions should be made in rural areas to improve employment rates.

1 0 I have a suggestion towards my Prime Minister and other concerned authorities. This suggestion is regarding our Republic Day. At the first look, it may seem to be a bit absurd and a change to big to be introduced, but I am sure a little introspection will reveal the true power of this suggestion. Please see the attachment for the full suggestion.
1 0 Dear PM, of all the initiatives that you and your team has taken, I appreciate the initiative of making all public transport and facilities handicap friendly. Great thought, but I don't see any great movement in that direction. While I understand and also acknowledge that it is difficult as our country is wide, but it can be made as csr activity for giant corporates, so that the thought can be materialised faster. Once again sirji it's a great thought. Let's join hands to make thier lives easier
0 0 Something need to be changed in our Education system, nowadays all universities are focusing on how to get more marks or how to topped in exam rather than practical experience,so there are so much to discuss.
0 0 Our Khadi bhandar in Mumbai Churchgate is quite big but the products available are slightly boring and monotonous in nature. Can we make use of space properly and have counters of each state Khadi products available under one roof year round. It would be nice to have products available under one roof. Ever since you started promoting khadi more and more people are showing interest. This will help generate higher revenues too. Also if you could send personal letters to all designers to use khadi
2 0 Dear Prime Minister Ji Failure to Cleanliness, One of the reason there is no Place to put garbage even if there is no body is responsible for removing on daily basis. I have a idea that under Manrega if we provide dust bins - half cut plastic drums & through RWA & other association make drive to tell people to put garbage there only & display the name of contractor who is responsible to clear. Authorities are not taking responsibility make cleaning as their objective in ACR.

0 0 So many countries developed but still all are saying India is developing country, how much time it takes to become developed country  ? Small countries providing employment to other country's students, but in country so much unemployment, reason  ?
0 0 Respected Sir, till now in our country so many villages without roads and electricity what the representatives doing  ?
0 0 Sir, on DIWALI most of the employes get some gift from employer. But some employee like rickshaw wala, sabji wala, Kisan , and many such people don't get  gift from their employer (which is normal public). It would be great if people who went to buy sabji , use rickshaw etc. Give some good wishes or gift to those people also because most of us not recognise that actually we are the employer for such people. So we can bring some happiness to their face. Jai Hind

0 0 water Washing also does not ensure cleanliness of big areas but results in considerable inconvenience to users and leads to wastage of water. Such practice of sweeping and large scale washing is not seen in any other country. They do only picking up of garbage and vacuum clean dust to the extent needed. It is my suggestion that same should be resorted to by an order to all the agencies employed in cleanliness of public premises.Also mopping of large ares should be done instead of water washing.

0 0 Why is govt. not planning to setup IT hubs in small places like Jharkhand and Lucknow .Why we have all the IT companies concentrated in South Indian cities like Bangalore and Chennai.

Narendra Modiji promised that there were be development all over but why is Eastern states of India lagging behind.What steps are govt. taking to enhance IT in Eastern States like Bihar, Jharkhand  Assam
0 0 Sir Happy Diwali & Saal Mubaarak. કેમ છો? I think sir We have to work hard on our education system. I can say every well settled person should take minimum 3 children responsibility to guide them or explain abt importance of education or financial help. It helps  India to educate more people. You share this with every Indian on #mannkibaat Regards, Rajdeepsinh Jadeja
0 0 Keeping the roads and public premises clean remainsa a challenge despite various methods being tried. One of the problems being faced in our style of keeping the public premises and road sides clean is that we resort to sweeping instead of picking up the garbage. Such large scale dry sweeping leads to shifting of part or entire garbage from one location to another location and also leads to considerable air pollution during sweeping. Washing is another practice which does not ensure cleanliness

0 0 Our Soldier's of great India are great who are securing our life from the terrorists. At present it is also very alarming is to protect daughters of our country who are facing criminals and did not getting any help from any place and local judicial systems and local police helping goons to behave wild and inhuman. Hence, humans having real wish to do good for others are need to be build up in the society. So help us. Thanking you with most humbly.

0 0 Respected PM, I think each and every person and home should be aware of the country in which they live. For that, a fund should be raised by Indians in which every person will contribute rs 1 every day and the fund should be given to the family martyred soldier. This will lead to awareness about sacrifice of solfiers and increase respect towards nation every day. And every small and big person can contribute to this national movement.

0 0 Deer PM, while watching your Diwali message to our soldiers, one idea came to my mind which I thought was worth sharing. The idea is can we not donate one rupee each to the family of our soldiers who have sacrificed their life in protecting the honor of our nation. I am sure people wont have any problem in contributing such a small amount (50p or 1re) for such a great cause.
1 0 Very Important Note for our PM & FM. Home Loan benefit in Income tax  should be given for only one Flat per individual. Its is like everyone keeps on buying the property for getting the income tax benefits & unnecessarily increase the cost of properties & it becomes very difficult for the lay man who cant afford the small home due to high prices.
0 0 On poor quality roads.. Why cannot municipality award the contracts for roads for 5 yrs period to various contractors like we do for housing society building painting ? Upkeeping those roads from all aspects like fining for parking in no-park zone, fining for littering, digging approval and repair, lighting maintenance, etc. Display the map of contractor of each road on website. Display contractor's name on poorly maintained roads to make his / her name shame while citizens pass that road.
0 0 Sir, Currently there is lack of respect for traffic rules which is leading to congestion on the roads,  a number of accidents and unfortunate loss of lives. Please mention in your "Mann Ki Baat" about the importance of following traffic rules which will hopefully bring about the much needed change in mindset among the people towards following traffic rules at all times and all situations.
1 0 Sir, There is urgent need for revamp in education system in India. In my opinion, there should be one courses of study all over India starting from Standard-VIII to Plus2 level with one Board conducting the examinations. No State Boards or separate courses of study for different states. It will help the students all over India to have a standard education at par. There should not be ICSE, CBSE etc. Only one i.e. NCERT to conduct the whole process.
0 0 Respected sir,I request you to say something about opening some platform for speakers or the students who have the passion of becoming professor at higher level.

0 0 Sir, I request you to please say something about making a pollution free diwali, green diwali, eco- friendly diwali. People shouldn't buy unnecessary things, instead they can donate necessary things to the needy people. Also people should not waste electricity in fancy lighting. I suggest instead of burning crackers on Diwali, each person should plant a tree and take care of it. Happly Diwali Sirji #MannKiBaat, #MyGov, #AIR, #PMOnRadio #Diwali

0 0 Namaskar. I have been perturbed by seeing the situation at most of the primary and higher secondary schools where either we do not have good and dedicated teachers (which we used to see when we were kids) or lack of interest on the students itself. I have a suggestion which may improve the situation and bring interests among teachers and students. I propose that it should be made mandatory to Millions of researchers like me to teach at the schools and that must be linked with their ACRs.Thank u.

0 0 sir, Now days, nobody is talking about dowry. perhaps they are thinking that dowry has ended to a great extent. i want to point out (in my opinion), dowry increases day to day. it is very disappointing that educated people escalate it.

1 0 Dear Modi Ji, I want to point out a big problem due to 100 days employment to rural people. * People who works in this scheme says, "We are getting Rs.140 or something without working properly per day. In that situation why we should work properly and get money" * As a result of this, not only the public money is wasted, it creates a wrong mentality to people. * people lacks the worth of money and leads to severe in disciplinary activities. Please consider my message ASAP. #AIR, #PMOnRadio
0 0 People should recognise as an Indian not by which state they are belong to.For example if someone is from Bihar then call him Bhartiya instead of Bihari and so on.This will create uniteness as well as Constitution also said to not discriminate on basis of region. Specially this will give respect for our N-E states brother and sister
1 0 If many Indian villages had main stream courses set up like mbbs ,bcomm ,or the courses which inspire them to build or invent and export and such which can lead them to be the person they want to be . Electricity , water available . And funds for these courses by government based on the salary of the parents . Our culture is rich , basically we need development of villages to develop India. Make all villages self sufficient. It will save major cities from burden of overpopulation also .

0 0 Sir, I want to draw your attention towards a disability which is not disability according to Indian laws. Lots of Candidates preparing for civil services exam & army get rejected due to colour blindness.while it is not defined as a disability in India ,so people don't get any protection from govt. And on the other hand they are being rejected for being colour blind.it is also to be mentioned that colour blinds can see those colors which are difficult for normal persons to identify.

0 0 Dear Modi Ji, I am supporter of Swachha Bharat Mission. Need to encourage private sector for waste collection and power generation from waste. Nexus of municipalities are not allowing to make this happen. Need to formulate a policy at center level to motivate the private company.

0 0 Dear Sir,I have a suggestion to reduce the pollution. Use of bicycle should be encouraged among all employees in all sectors. Now a days a good bicycle is coming in Rs. 15-20 thousand. This can be funded by 0% interest loan with easy EMI. In spite of your best effort, corruption is still the greatest concern of this country.  There is no mechanism to check foreign visits, gifts, illegal money, awards and many more such incentives. An expiry date can be placed on currency.

In IT sector we as a nation is recognized as a service nation and not as a product based nation. Most of the IT products are developed by western countries, though they use our brains to create. Wouldn't be a great idea if the government provides subsidies and tax discounts to companies who invest money for product related activities. This step will encourage companies
0 0 Sir, incidences of animal cruelty are increasing in India. Madam Maneka Gandhi is doing a wonderful job helping animals, I congratulate her. Your opinion matters to innumerable Indians. Please include this in Mann ki Baat. Target the youth and children, many people shall follow your advice. Animals are used for food, clothes, accessories but denied the right to pain- and hunger-free existence. Are they not a part of India? Fear promotes cruelty. Ask parents to teach children to love animals.

0 0 Dogs are human being's best friend.  Diwali is the festival of light and happiness which is often a nightmare for our best friend. Children often find it amusing to tie crackers or more specifically 'ladi' which depresses and harasses dogs and cats. This Diwali lets pledge to altleast reduce the bursting of heavy noice creating crackers so to bring happiness everywhere. I request Honourable prime minister Narendra Modi to address this issue and request fellow citizens to stop abuse of animals.
0 0 IAS, Police & other government positions have entrance exam. But there are many critical positions which do not have entrance exam which can test candidates capabilities to handle the position in best way with complete ethics & values.

This way governance quality can be improved.

2 0 Dear Modi sir Congratulations for Good Government, you are doing wonderful Job. Sir you have already taken measures to curb black money that's great but my suggestion to encourage more people to pay tax is to start some incentive policy for existing taxpayers from last 5-7 years. This will not only encourage newer people for paying more taxes but also boost existing taxpayers. Modi Sir as we are talking of young India, and let me tell you 1 thing that Young India is not poor India. Jai Hind🙏🙏
1 0 Respected Sir As our country is becoming more and more populous day by day. Unless we control our population our all plan and schemes are utilized efficiently.

0 0 We must look into our education system deeply. The school system does not encourage students to ask - it's about teachers to tell. It kills the curiousity and also does not make them self-responsible. So Indian work force doesn't have a great reputation abroad. Indians are known to shirk work, and this comes from years of working only for marks and not foryourself. In the end our students are quite different from students in US and other advanced nations. #MannKiBaat, #MyGov, #AIR, #PMOnRadio
0 0 I wish a happy& prosperous Diwali to you and your Govt.which has worked very well inspite of all odds&opposition.Certain unique works had been done in the interest of the people like Divyang welfare,Ujjawala yojna,reformsin Railway& telecom sector etc.but more gaps are to be filled in Swacchata mission so that taxpayers money does'nt go waste and the killer diseases like Dengue,chickengunia viral fever,Malaria etc.

Unless the PAN Card copy is submitted the tenant cannot claim the HRA while the owner enjoys the rent and cheats the Govt. Earlier we could claim the HRA by giving an undertaking from the Owner. The Govt should provide an alternative on how the HRA can be claimed in this situation and also provide a forum where such owners can be reported. Regards Yogesh

0 0 1. The Haryana growth is limited and against your "make in India" mission due to the "Khirki Daula toll" in Gurugram, Haryana. The toll should be removed cos due to this the investers are reluctant to cross the toll and invest in Manesar, Pachgaon, Dharuhera, Rewari, Bawal belt. Why cant Haryana govt pay 350 Cr, remove KD toll and open the gates for huge investment on GGn-Bawal (DMIC) belt. I think PMO needs to lead KD Toll removal and guide the state govt, help them.

2 0 Sir, I am impressed with your initiatives. Development is good but rather than commenting on development I would give emphasis on women's safety. This has become extremely important. Its hard to give safety to each and individual girl / women of India,but we will should come up with mandatory self-safety training for girls and harsher and faster punishment for criminals.Crime against women are rising everyday. India is our motherland and let us all commit to protect our mothers and sisters.

0 0 Respected Prime Minister, I heartly feel that Government should fix a criteria for fighting the elections. I think that a politician must be graduated, no police case in past. And a written test and finally interview. And after all that he can be eligible for fighting the elections. Written test and interviews should be conducted by IAS officers and JUDGES of high court. if you are graduated then you have knowledge and may be less corrupt. But I know that it is not possible.

I would feel highly obliged if you kindly address them directly in your next Man ki baat speech. I request you to include action plans to include Kashmiris into main stream India.

1 0 Namaskar to Sri. Narendara Modi sir, My suggestion to the government of India should start a project which will "Nuclear Sheild the enitre India".  I suggest the name of this project would be called "RAKSHA" (A telugu word which means PROTECTION). If this project completes successfully it will safeguard 1.3 billion people of India from nuclear threat. Now a days we see tensions all over the world especially some countries who are not more responsible in handling their nuclear tests and weapons.
2 0 Respected Prime Minister Sir, I am a student of class 12th and this being my arra of interest urge you to pay forward some attention to it, I wanted to say that, Why only businessman and entrepreneurs are only chased by the income tax raids? Why not the bureaucrats and officials, who have multiple times more money than what businessmen have! And also that even being the highest taxpayers and the one who develops are chased! Rather than people with political background, who only gift backdrops.

0 0 Dear Respected PM, Wishing you a HAPPY DIWALI. I am sure your positive mindset will take this nation to greater heights. This positive mindset is what I want you to focus for the nation to achieve transformation. Negativism kills benefits. Many tasks need to be accomplished and resolve is required. Similarly people should inculcate 'nek vichaar', spirit of sacrifice and concern for humans which is sadly missing.
0 0 Namaste Modi Ji, I am a native of Bhagalpur, Bihar and I would like to draw your attention towards the extremely lethargic judiciary in our country. A court case has been going on my ancestral home for last 26 yrs. I belong to the 3rd generation who might get sucked into this seemingly never ending court case. My house is in extremely bad shape and needs repairs but due to the on going case we cannot do that. We have suffered too much, I request to do something to speed up the judiciary.

0 0 please share your views about the stray dog menace in the country in next #MannKiBaat, #PMOnRadio. Even though ultimate blame for this problem is the citizens them self, who pollute their surroundings and public space with there solid wastes, especially food leftovers; immediate solution lies in culling of the rabies affected stray dogs. ABC program works as a mid-term or long term solution, but by then many a lives would have been bitten to death by the mauling jaws of the kennel.

But we also need to consider the World Bank ranking and my little advice is kindly make separate committee of all state minister and central ministers(industry wise) which can communicate with world bank or other international authorities, and take necessary step and implement it on national and state level like GST council. It will help to accelerate decision making and making uniform law all over India.

0 0 Dear Modiji, Our Home guards are a potent force that are not given due recognition as their experti is not fully utilized. Kindly consider including them in the NDRF. Also request you to instruct state governments to use the services of Home guards during festivities and religious gatherings, instead of using our over-stretched (and hence over-stressed) police force. It will ensure better utilization of home guards and will allow the police force to focus on law enforcement.

0 0 Dear Sir, recently Neelam Katara (mother of honour killing victim Nitish Katara) said on a popular news show, that she would like to see a Safe In India campaign first, because one cannot Make In India unless we are safe and free to live a dignified life. The macabre murders of young women in metropolitan cities like Delhi and Chennai only further drive home this point. A nationwide,long term campaign to address the pressing issue of Safety, esp. of Women, must be initiated. #AIR #MannKiBaat

0 0 Modiji, when things are improving on all fronts, can we let our national broadcaster Doordarshan lag behind ? I stay in Singapore and we have access to every major national channel in the world be it US, China, Japan or other countries and we seee how they use their channel to showcase their countries. Can Doordarshan also pull up its socks and present the India story to the world in a much more compelling and convincing way ? Hope the IB ministry will take note of this suggestion.Happy Diwali!
0 0 Dear Modiji, When we speak of valour and selfless service, we miss out on appreciating services of our Fire personnel. Kindly consider bringing the Fire Force/ brigade under NDRF. That will not only give them the due national recognition, it will also help scale up their current skills and morale. Additionally, they will be a force multiplier in disaster situations as their skills/ expertise/ experience can be used at a national level. They will also have a better career progression.

0 0 Dear Modiji, 1) Under Swachh Bharat, there should be guidelines issued with respect to disposing of electronic waste, plastic/ polythene products, any other kind of waste that can adversely impact the environment. These guidelines should be included in school & college curriculum. Volunteer groups should be created to bring about awareness in societies, slums, offices, communities & other groups, sanitary workers, etc.
0 0 Dear Modiji, While hoisting our national flag during Independence and Republic day at schools, housing societies, offices, parks, etc, we should "honour" our security personnel/ soldiers by inviting them to hoist the flag instead of local politicians/ school principals/ housing society members. The young impressionable minds of our society will also get to see first-hand the "honour" in selfless service to the nation given by our security personnel/ soldiers.
0 0 Dear Modiji, We pray "Annah data sukhi bhava" before meals, for the wellbeing of our farmer community. We should have a similar prayer for well being of our security personnel/ soldiers. "Raksha Karta sukhi bhava" (or something better), before we retire to bed every night. This is for the well being of our security personnel, irrespective of which uniform they wear i.e. whether from Indian Military/ Indian Police/ NIA/ NDRF/ CBI/ Intelligence agencies or any other security agency).

The Central government should look in to this matter of misuse of Aadhaar cards, as its stakes are pretty high, with supreme Court yet to give its consent to make it mandatory document.
0 0 The NDA Government has identified Aadhaar as the single most effective tool to deliver food grins, fertilizers, kerosene and LPG subsidies to target the beneficiaries with minimum leakage.  Most of the Aadhaar card are linked to the ration card across the country.  The State Governments should conduct the investigations on the possible misuses of Aadhaar numbers.

Most of the women workerers were yet to marry and they have to earn to save for their marriage as they cannot depend on their parents due to the poverty.
0 0 The government should focus on the garment workers and also who works in private company and establishments, getting low salaries and job insecurity of lakhs of workers.  These workers are paid poorly and they also risk in losing their jobs as factories, private companies and establishment often shut down operations without no reasons.  An average worker earn just Rs. 5000/- to 6000/- PM with no benefits other than PF and ESI and gratuity.
0 0 The film maker was made to pay Rs. 5 Cr to an army fund as penance for engaging a Pakistani artist is a worst part of deal.  This amount to a extortion or bribe which criminals take to ensure the running of normal business.  Bringing the army in to this political deal is bad. The claim that the payment was voluntary cannot be believed at all.  It is like the police telling the trader to pay the protection money to the street thug.

0 0 I believe you are aware of objections made by Indian Armed Forces in 7th pay commission reports.But I don't understand why there is so much disparity in Soldiers and their civilian counterparts,why they have to fight for what they deserve?The disability pension for an Additional Secretary is Rs70,000 and that of a three-star General only Rs 27,000,it should be SAME ATLEAST.The odds of a man in uniform getting injured is several times more likely than that of the civilian counterpart.

But when it comes to national Interest they divided into different parties and don't run the parliament so why should government not take a stand on "NO WORK NO PAY"#MannKibaat

1 0 Respected sir, My idea is that every college should have a Paper recycling unit of its own, since paper is the main form of waste created by colleges. 1. This will educate students about the importance of recycling thus providing a path to greener future. 2. It help to improve the environment & in dealing with waste. 3. It will give job to the needy people. 4. It is estimated that recycling half the world’s paper would avoid the harvesting of 20 million acres of forestland.

Cant we tighten the recognition criteria for private schools. they compromise a lot in all respect to have huge profits.

0 0 continuation ..35000+ ppl are visiting tirupati temple but many of them dont know that there is a science musuem in tirupati. Then how will the country progress? In the temple premesis/ busstand/ railway station, this should be painted so that ppl get awareness. Similarly in Vijayawada temple/ railway station also. Liquor/ tobacco production/ sale should be banned fully. Otherwise there is no point in saying on stages about 'honouring women and women upliftment schemes'

But the size of ICE CUBE gradually goes decreasing so sir please take care
0 0 I am working as a banker. My suggestion is regarding education system. Most of the children in country goes to private school, but i did not understand the salary of a private school teacher is very less in compare to government school teacher.

They got bonus in Diwali approx Rs.6000, but private school teachers are doing job on 5000-15000. kindly treat this as a suggestion it is my own view.

0 0 Sir, the people of our country need to realise what a democracy is. People should realise that a democracy is a not only a government where we can elect our leaders, but is also a system where everyone participates to make our country a better place to live. We need people to participate in making Bharat a world power. If people have "fundamental rights", they have equally important "Fundamental Duties". Once all of us realise this, Bharat will be an unstoppable development machine.
0 0 The pension received by employees under the Employees' Pension Scheme 1995 remains unchanged no matter the cost of living index rises to any level in future. This is unlike the case of pension received by an employee retired from the Government service which increases to many folds in a short period after their retirement. I would humbly request you respected sir, to kindly arrange the needful such that all retired employees get  their pension based on the cost of living index from time to time.

0 0 Last night I was reading about Mahatma Gandhi's assassination and suddenly something struck my mind it was the efforts Indians made in that freedom struggle. We respect and talk about our soldiers, dalits, casts, etc. on every platform but this is a part which we basically forget to mention. There were not just a few 10-15 leaders in that struggle whom we know but there were 100s of others who were left behind in our thoughts I believe this time they deserve our gratitude. #MyGov

2 0 Sir I am working in Govt Health department for last 20 years and have observed that most of the young people contracting TB have a common habit of leaving for job or college without having breakfast.

I think Mann ki bat is a very effective way to spread this very important message for our young people.Regards

1 0 Dear prime minister sir I just want to draw your attention towards a scarce source,water. At villages in indian households people are using submersible pumps,which can fetch so much quantity of water in minutes but all this water is not going to store anywhere but to be drained into nalah or sewers. Once they start the pump for any work it is not going to stop until the electricity is gone. a large amount of drinkikable water is wasted due to which water table is degrading day by day Thanks
0 0 Respected PM Modiji, it would be nice if you explain to the younger generation ie tomorrow's citizens who are instant noodle kids, the invaluable very precious lives of our soldiers, their bravery, determination, will-power that helps them live in extreme climates and the huge sacrifice of their lives for us and the sacrifices their families make to keep us safe. These kids have got everything easy & don't understand the value of struggles, failure, hard-work, sacrifice in making a person great.

As we all know that these are very hazardous to our health and environment. It also very deadly to cows. Polythene being non biodegradable very hard to safely dumping or recycling.

Since solar energy is plenty, distillation is the best and we can develope our own purification system. It will not be expensive.
0 0 Respected Sir, Please increase more Research budget in Solar Technology and Electrical vehicle Production, Because best way to reduce Pollution is only increase in use of Electrical  Cars. Also encourage people for use of Electrical Car and scooters.
0 0 Water problem is a major problem. We are having both drought and flood. The immediate need is we have to crate water grid through out our country very similar to power grid. Instead of joining rivers which requires lot of money and land acquisition, ecological clearance etc. But formation of grid is easy as we have to bury big pipes throughout the country. This can be done by creating a corpus fund from the public. In my town I have palar but there is no water. Only during flood water will come.
0 0 Sir I have uploaded a grievance on your webpage but till I don't get a soln. of that and this problem is common for all students of Rajasthan , So I request you to give a immediate result as mentioned in attached Image.
1 0 Respected Modiji, I wish to present before you that in your forth coming speech on "Mann Ki bath" programme , please advise  the people to stop burning crackers during diwali. It burns their  health as well as wealth. Let them donate that money to the nation as a contribution to soldier welfare fund or feed the poor by donating it to orphange.We can start a new culture which will give more shine to our diwali. Simutaneously let them light small clay lamps.Dr.C.Dileep,Asst Professor,Kerala

0 0 Respected Prime Minister, Happy Diwali! A united India is a better and stronger India. Ours is a country of more than a billion people differing in language, culture and religion. The only thing that can bind us together is mutual respect for each other and acceptance of our differences; let us agree to disagree and still hold hands. I am disturbed by the intolerance and acts of violence around us. Please use the media programs like serials to promote tolerance and harmony among people.
0 0 Dear sir , i just have suggestion regarding the prevention of overcharging of meals in trains.Just provide an option for meal booking while booking a train ticket like the one used to provide bedrolls in garib rath .It would help in reducing practice of overcharging in trains .Moreover it would be good enough to replace the old cooking methods used in pantry cars with hitech ovens which would reheat the precooked meals .It would remove problems concerning food in trains and would boost railways.

1 0 Mr. PM. We are already working on betterment of our infrastructure. Meanwhile we can also make use of our existing ones in a more efficient manner. Like schools can be turned into career counselling centers/training/computer centers during the night. Also there must be a consolidated effort towards finding the aptitude of our students in their early teens, so they have a clear direction from an early age and we are able to produce graduates with a high level of specialization. #MannKiBaat #MyGov
0 0 Respected Prime Minister Sir, Jai Hind and Happy Diwali to you. First of all I would like to congratulate to you for all successful programmes launched by Our Government under your leadership. You are inspiration for us. Really our nation is changing and developing. The mission of Swacch Bharat has now become a vast program and we can see cleanliness at many places in our country. Gently request you to please initiate one more mission "Save Food, Produce Food" i.e, "Annam Raksham".
0 0 Food adulteration is a serious crime however, authorities do not have any concrete plan to deal with this. Food adulterators must be booked for attempt to murder or murder as the case may be. Swatch bharat campaign must be followed with swasth (healthy)bharat.

0 0 Adarniye PM ji. While wishing everyone a happy and prosperous Deepavali,please mention how 'andhakar' is being removed from the lives of our kisans in 10000 villages because electricty has been brought to their homes. Request that you suggest to those villagers and our farmer brothers and sisters that they can now increase their incomes by installing  solar modules on their houses and feed back electricity to the grid. They can get loans from Mudra and subsidies from the government to do that.
0 0 Honorable PM of India, please kindly do favour for our drought area in Dharmapuri District, Kadathur New Union at Tamilnadu.

0 0 Honorable Sir, since last few days there is a news regarding some new bank account opened for Army welfare and it asks people to deposit at least 1 Rs in it. No beneficiary name has been provided and account name is also doubtful. I and a lot of people believe this is fake account due to this as we already have defence fund. If this news is true please refrain the doubt in people minds . If not,order for inquiry of such types of frauds.
1 0 Sir,Can we teach students about value based education and build confidence in them so that they will become an employment generator rather than seeker. Teaching should be based on providing education for solving the challenges that they will face in their life from different dimensions not just securing marks by rote. Student vision should be for India first rather than seeking himself only. And this kind education will be provided by giving them responsibility(as per their age).
0 0 Honorable P. M. Sir, This is to request you to please develop a fair system for evaluation of TOLL being paid at STATE & NATIONAL highways and it's proper utilization since unlimited number of private & commercial vehicles pass through it every day fetching toll Authorities a huge some of money.Most of these tolls have made it an endless business with the help of certain corrupt officials
0 0 Dear Honorable PM Shri. Narendra Modijee, This month, A 13-year-old girl in Hyderabad died after fasting for 68 days as per Jain rituals during the holy period of 'Chaumasa'. This is sheer cruelty on the part of her family. Please talk on this issue. On one hand we are loosing our kids in tribal region due to malnutrition and here in a well to do family, a young girl died due to fasting in front of the whole family. Such religious practices should be banned by law.
0 0 Sir, It will be much helpful if biomatric system for the municipality pension holders of odisha can also be made as it is done for government pension holders so that the aged persons above 80/85 years of age can also receive their pension easily wherever they stay with their children within India. Thanking you.
0 0 Sir if slums in big cities are transformed in such a way that they look clean and tidy then you can rename the area to "Aadarsh Nagar", just a thought.

0 0 Dear Honourable Prime Minister, Initially, many thanks for giving us such platform where we can share with you our ideas. I personally feel, we need to think of making Election Commission and its process digital especially the Elections where many citizens like me face difficulties due to mobilisation/ migration to different states during the elections.
0 0 Honorable PM, Sir, recently you came to Vadodara for a public gathering, and we the citizens witnessed the best administrative personnel at their honest work, to make sure that our Beloved PM feels welcome to Home.But But But as you left the city, the life of common man was as usual, city was unclean as usual, no rules followed, nobody bothered...My question "Why the administrative wings can't think every individual as their beloved PM"...won't it make a BIG DIFFERENCE.. Thanks, Stalin
0 0 First of all I want to thank you Mr. Prime Minister for your sincere efforts towards Swacch Bharat Mission. Even I was careless earlier but after listening to your thoughts I got inspired. I have even seen in public  the feeling to throw the garbages in dustbin. We all Indians would always b grateful for having such a prime minister.
0 0 Hon;ble PM Please go through the file.
0 0 Dear Mr. Prime Minister, I think there should be an effective evaluation of government employees. Often we see/ face that the customers are standing at the desk and they keep on doing their own work. Because it is a myth that once you get a government job no one can sack you. Yesterday I saw a video on youtube showing a railway employee doing her personal work and people are waiting. As soon as someone protested she closed the counter.
0 0 honebled prime minister i want you to aware people about decreasing environment quality in our country,i think growing vegetation on vacant spaces of terrace would be good initiative to meet the demands of population for food and also this would prevent people from getting adulterated food as many countries are using such techniques everyone can't grow on large scale so if few plants would be grown then it will also make people involved in increasing greenary and clean environment

0 0 Dear Sir, citing disabled friendly work place as the reason for transfer. They need to deal with buying of groceries to attending functions in personal. Disabled persons also have personal life. Just saying you will be provided with Quarters and reachable work place will not help. They need their family and friends to help them. Their needs are special. Native/home cadre posting helps them and the nation.

In TN some village people make bio gas,food items,roads with plastic and had given jobs to many. But other states even developed state Maharashtra and Delhi are neglecting this matter.Wastes will be the reason for next dispute. Some states treat the adjoining states as dustbin.
0 0 Hon'ble Prime Minister, Lot of appreciable efforts has been done by the Govt to equip persons with disabilities with aids and appliances.However much efforts are needed to explore new livelihood opportunities for them as per the present market demand and design and develop skill training programme accordingly to bring them to main stream. Even National institutes are lacking this vision.

0 0 #MannKiBaat: Modi jee I feel that in India our behavior varies markedly depending on the other person's social & financial status, gender,age, caste and creed..we are not polite to everyone, we may look down on people we feel are lower than us. Why is our behavior not dependent on our own 'sabhyata' . Don't all Indians have the right to dignity ? We can start with being polite to the people who come to work in our homes. They should not be shouted at..Right to dignity is every Indian's right..
0 0 Dear Sir, I want to draw your attention towards unnecessary usage of air conditioner in premises of govt as well as private, even in winter , where there is no external air & sound pollution.

Thanking you prasanta

1 0 Respected P. M. Sir, Recently came across Grippen fighter plane deal along with transfer of technology.But does it really holds a cutting edge over it's competitors like SU 30/35vF16 & others.plane is 4th generation and is also under upgradation to 5th generation. Plane costs about 45mill $ while SU30 costs 65mill $.In terms of combat it holds 3/10 while SU 30 holds 7/10. It's only fuel efficient & low maintenance plane but can't be taken in 1st line in modern warfare

1 0 Respected Prime Minister, Season's Greetings. Sir, There is huge consumption of fire wood for performing the last rites. The government should take immediate steps to have atleast one electric crematorium in every town with a population of 2 lakhs and in cities having population of more than 5 lakhs, there should be an electric crematorium in every cremation ground. Many towns and cities still do not have electric crematorium facilities inspite of people ready to make use of it. Thank you.

0 0 #MannKiBaat I was very delighted when i visited your website and saw an initiative Mascot which is supposed to reduce the number of road safety by 50% in next five years. I don't disagree that campaigns are a great way to reach people, but don't you think that it must be the hazards of road accidents that must be showcased in front of public instead of a campaign for eg. People wear helmet to protect them from police, but it never comes to their mind that they are actually protecting their head.

0 0 Diwali,Eid and Christmas are 3 biggest festivals in our country. IT companies avoid festival season holidays even on such festivals.

If the companies really have imp. work and business loss they will pay fine to government. This would earn revenue for govt. else company would shut the company. Jai Hind!

0 0 I would like to suggest idea for Swaach Bharat Abhiyan. My suggestion is to register all the street beggars in metros as swaachta karyakartas and they should be provided with camera phones to click pictures of people littering on streets.

The program should also be incentivized for more participation. This would help us to make a better India.

0 0 My inspiration, Modi sir a  very good evening to u.!Sir can we increase the imprisonment of the criminals of human trafficking(especially sexual exploitation)?It is 7 years. In my opinion it should be min of 20 years and max of 30 years.Criminals of  this specific case feel free and do whatever they want to do, moreover the know they will get release after 7 years and in some cases theytry to attempt murder of victim,because girls unki baat nahi sunti.Understand the plight of girls.Thank u

0 0 Hello sir,can we Provide smart Education to Rural Area...
0 0 As a kid, I was always told that India is bound to be a super power since we will have the largest working population by 2020. But today, the world is changing so rapidly that adaptation is the only mode of survival and in this case, I feel, that our education is lagging behind. A gun without bullets or bullets without a gun are of no use, similarly, youth without knowledge or skills will not lead us anywhere. Let's not create jobs, let's create people who can create their own jobs!
0 0 The joy of riding a cycle is magical, and these cyclists are the true torchbearers of the Save the Earth Campaign. In todays fast paced technological world, we often tend to neglect the implications of our actions on our well being and on our environment. Cycling on the other hand is environment friendly. If it isn't already a part of your everyday routine, there's no time to start like the present. We ride back on these two wheels to a better future. A drive to a better Earth....

If this project is made in every village then we will never Face availability of milk products and gobar Gas can be utilised for cooking in cities also. We can save foreign currency and export outside.
1 0 Sir just a simple request on a controversial topic. i.e. Reservation. The main aim of reservation was to attain right to equality. Nowadays there are people from reserved category who have used the reservation in good use and developed themselves.

And provide it to all other students with poor background based on their merit and not caste

0 0 Dear Prime Minister, I am very glad to write you. First of all i want to thank you for doing a lot for our country. Yes all of your steps are going into right direction but i think that all your ideas like 'SWATCH BHARAT ABHIYAN' or others become successful only when there is a control of population in our country. I have listen all your speech and lectures but never found that you talk about population control. So please take any action on population growth.

0 0 Hon'ble Prime Minister I have lot in my mind to talk about.Many of us have posted here that each one want to help the gov in the welfare activities of our brave hearted soldiers and development of the defence forces.I really appreciate their thoughts.What I think is what if we deduct a very negligible amount from every citizens bank account every year with their concent.Think of the whole population or even half of it contributing.We can safeguard our borders and even the soldiers families.
0 0 Sir, Our farmers are experiencing very tough time. they keep on waiting of monsoon and they are growing crops hardly one or two times in a year, which is not good for nation.we should set some independent commission which will decide the sale price of their crops and their training, soil testing, every basics needs required for crops growing. we should also provide some system like Fire department water pipe line so that they can utilise the water at any time in the year in their land.

Why don't we have one government IT company or infrastructure, govt is paying high amount to the private companies, then why don't we think on government IT sector. It may also improve the quality of governance & might be a helpful jump to reduced the corruption. Youth is eagerly waiting to work for the government in IT sector.#MannKibaat

1 0 Dear PM Sir, You had started a very worthy scheme: Startup India, Standup India. Sir, if practically viewed it seems for just the reserved sector of India. What's the value of scheme then? If a poor individual belongs to General category, has a great business initiative, but can't apply to get any benefits under the scheme because the government only allows reserved category applicants as the eligible candidate for the scheme. Sir, is this really justice and can this benefit all equally?
0 0 Sir our govt. is doing efforts on Swach Bharat Abhiyan. My view is there should be emergency no. like police, fire, women discrimination etc. like this a a emergency no. and a team should be launch to take responsibility and quick action on that so that to take a control over irresponse people.

Less cost on education more India grow.

0 0 Policing instead of being proactive has become a post-op. Lethargy or attitude of avoidance has made Policing an object of ridicule and mockery.If only PM and HM can take effective steps to educate and motivate local Police to be on constant vigil, whether in or out of Uniform, and offer protection for genuine action India would be accidents free and incidents free
0 0 Sir  Your Government has made all efforts to make  GST a reality in India.  Regarding the rate we need to be very careful.  Same item should not find place in two different tariffs. Eg a machined component may be used in a machine and also as a automobile component.  If the rates for the part used in machine and part used in automobile are different it will create confusion. Anti profiteering provisions should be made in some form or the other for a minimum period of one year

By this, the outcome would be marvellous as we can inculcate the feeling of commitment in them! Also politicians should unite for this cause!

0 0 Dear PM, If you could send 50 thousand Indian students for post graduation to countries of their choice with condition that they return and work or teach in India, It could improve our academic culture.

Also please allow schools to run in rented premises at least in the small villages and towns as part of NEP

0 0 Respected Mr. Prime Minister, The inclusion of cellular technology has given us the needed connectivity but has widened the gap within the society. To increase the social bond there is a suggestion. Students enrolled in NCC/NSS in various institutions can be alerted when someone is in distress based upon the location. A gazetted officer can approve the student based upon the severity of emergency. MHRD can give some incentive (waiver of fees) based upon effective accomplishment.

The pin should able to be changed by Phone Banking or Internet Banking

1 0 As every industries are present in Metro cities, so people from villages have to come for work in metro and leave their parents and villages alone and they have to stay far from home. So cant we start initiative as "One Village One Industry" so people staying in villages get jobs within their village itself and they don't have to go far from their parents. If it succeed then metro will not get over populated and villages should not became empty. Due to this villages will also become smarter
0 0 Dear Respectable Prime Minister, This is regarding the recent frauds on Credit cards. One should be able to Disable/Enable international feature by phone banking or Internet banking, so that the international usage feature is allowed for the moment it is required. By default it should be disabled, unless the customer wants. Further when the card is detected by the system as being used/swiped outside India, it should ask for another pin. I feel these can be implemented easily. Regards

0 0 All our ministers (including PM)are Top Most Government person. In their public address they must speak as Government Representives and not as member of any political party. They must also resist from making statements indicating poor performance of previous Governments, they are representing the Government of India, they must continue talking on actions, results, future plans, advisories, let all of us be positive, constructive; then only we shall grow sustainably.

1 0 Sir,I am totally impressed your successfully concluded IDS and I suggest you to take a 'Surgical Strike' on all Indian filmy personalities for hiding the black money without any fear and partiality.Openly the common men are knowing how much they earning and how much they disclosing.
0 0 Militancy anywhere in the world is a matter of serious concern even if it is in Pakistan. We are suffering from various forms of militancies for a long time whether it is Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orrissa, J&K, or Northeast. We must understand the reasons of people turning militants and tackle.
0 0 Skills are not born only in school, college, institution and at any special place and religion or title. School, College and institutions have all ready recognized for skill person.

0 0 Sir, I appreciate Swachha Bharat movement, I would like to give one suggestion which I think can make this movement more effective. Sir we don't have sufficient DUSTBIN on roads. Dustbins should be available at walking distance, so that we will be able to throw things in dustbin. For this we can encourage people to keep small dustbin outside of there Shop or Home.
0 0 I saw many people comments and complaints after surgical strike by India on Pakistan and many of those shows lots of disrespect to our army, some even made by politician just to get publicity. The reason behind it is they don't know how army works and perform to give their best to save ourselves and nations. My suggestion to PMO is to mandate and make it compulsory for all citizens of India to perform in army for two years as soon they turn 18 years old so that they know how & what army does.
0 0 Dear Sir 1. Ban access of accessories from those countries who support Pak led terrorism. 2. There are huge vacant land by the side of railway track miles after miles. Plant Fruit-Trees there. 3.

Some days before I came to know through media, As per Global Hunger Index Report UN released total list of 118 countries and India stand as 97 out of 118.In India 39% children are undeveloped due to lack of adequate nutrition. Total 15.2% population of India is suffering from Malnutrition. The GHI (UN) given 28.5 score to India. As per report our neighboring country Nepal,Bangladesh,Mayanmar and Srilanka is better than India.
1 0 #MaanKiBaat Dear PM Sahib...Jai Bharat. It is humbly requested that the wages of Army/security personnel etc should be enhanced and those who sacrifies their lives for the sake of the Nation should be declared as "BHARAT-PUTR" officially and his family is rewarded with at least Rs:One Crore irrespective of the state he belongs too. We as an united society and nation can easily do this. With best wishes and warm regards. Kishore Kumar Sharma alis Vidhrohi...Zirakpur(Mohali).
0 0 Hi Sir, Kindly explain the uniform civil code in very layman language as to what does it contain and clear the myths that people debate about the same? I guess, even going forward, it is always beneficial to explain the new laws or benefits to people in the language they understand through this. Since it comes from the PM, people will not doubt further. Jai Hind.
0 0 HONORABLE ,Prim Minister GOVT. OF INDIA NEW DELHI
0 0 Kindly encourage small local labors and farmers so that we can improve our market and if we boycott foreign goods for continuous 90 days strictly like emergency period, definitely US dollar will come down to five rupees. Also, kindly take action to get cauvery water supply to Tamilnadu as we are really shortage of water. Our main task is Agriculture, Bringing Black Money, Good Education, Improving Local market, reducing petrol and diesel rates, etc.
0 0 Dear Modiji, Namaskar. Jai Hind. Vande Mataram. Jai Shree Ram. Happy and Prosperous Diwali to you. I pray sincerely to God and my spiritual Master Sri Gnanananda Giri Maharaj to shower more strength and blessings upon you for more tenures as PM. Kindly take severe and strict action on Pakistan as we are facing more and more lives of jawans almost everyday. Kindly insist to develop agriculture immediately as we are in need of the hour. Strictly boycott Chinese products even electronics also.
0 0 take pledge that all indians are our brothers and sisters.Let us act in this direction and make the pledge meaningful by taking care of our dalit brothers and sisters..
0 0 I had few friends who belong to dalit community.They are very affectionate and innocent people and we have to treat them with affection.  The dalit colonies represent the most lopsided face of our development policies.Ward members,MLAs to visit such colonies make and assessment of the situation and use their funds to improve the situation.Even individual citizens and civil society can interact with them ,understand their problems ,bring them to the notice of authorities for further action.we
0 0 him but have we ever thought of how many days he had been without food?? The food that we eat today are the effort of their labour and our streerts are clean due to their efforts.The society has given them torture ,discrimination,ill treatment,poverty..etc.They are not even aware of their rights as a citizen  as they are toiling from dawn to dusk for a livelihood and rarely get time to fight for their rights.So we have to reach out ot them.
0 0 Dear Sir, With regard to Swatch Bharat though people have become conscious of keep their locality clean there need to be Swatch Toilets at prominent locations in all cities and towns and help citizens to be good citizens. No one intends to urinate or defecate but the urgency and non availability of swatch public toilets make them do such shameful act. Request you to involve local authorities and plan for a scheme to bring cleanliness and maintenance of public toilets
0 0 Here are some helpful info about bio-degradable plastics downloaded in PDF.
0 0 Sir, I requested to you, we need to focus on our farmer and give him new technology and loan for improve his/her production, because Farmers trend now seems to be working slowly, so the government will have to take some good steps, and the government must stop using agricultural land misuse. And should not be built on farm land.All these facilities/technology give the best rate/discount. Jai Javan Jai Kisan Jai Hind Jai Bharat
0 0 Sir Dalits are attacked for various reasons in our  country.A major issue in this regard is that they are mostly attaced on the issue of killing of cows.How long can a person survive without food?? The abject condition of poverty that compel them to kill cows for food as dead cows are the only food available to them without facing objection from others.They have a no intention to offend religious sentiments of our society.If ever a dalit have been caught attacking a cow the society has punished
0 0 Respected Modiji, Kindly have a talk about bio-degradable plastics @ your upcoming MANN KI BAAT, so that we can reduce the environmental pollution whether it is water or land or air polluition. Have a complete ban of plastics and to engage the people of our country in using and producing bio-degradable plastics which can be easily degraded by burying and by the action of micro-organisms. http://www.biostockspro.com/7-advantages-of-biodegradable-plastics/

0 0 Aadharaniya Prime minister I would like to invite your attention regarding road traffic rules violation.you can assess the fact that accidents are causing loss of life ,money,energy etc. In this occasion I would like you to invite our techies to develop a soft ware in the form of sensors that,shouldnt allow a person while driving to use mobile phone.I think it can reduce the accident rate.Thus we can save money for our country. Respectfully Raji Kerala
0 0 Respected Sir, I can feel positive vibrations under your government, which were missing earlier. Sir, Air Pollution is getting worst day by day in delhi and other metro cities. We may encourage peoples to use environment friendly options like cycling to office(if possible),use of public transport etc. Some sort of encouragement to the peoples who use cycle for their daily activities and we need to change the common thought that cycle is for poor and it is not as per our status. Thanks Jai Hind.
0 0 Respected PM, I would like to draw your attention towards an issue we are failing to heed — INCREASING CRUELTY TOWARDS ANIMALS. In the recent times a number of incidents involving sadistic and insensitive approach towards animals have surfaced. If this issue is not addressed, innocent animals would continue to suffer at the hands of human recklessness. I request you to urge the people of this country to treat animals with respect and care and enforce stricter punishments against miscreants
0 0 Sir, Please read my point on farmers. i have attached a file. Jai Shree Ram
0 0 Dear Sir I would say government is doing good in every field .but there is need of action of every plan which are in existence ,and to get any results action is highly important which is slow need to be fast,further highly quality education is missing in rural area specially attention required there,another most important thing population pressure need to take some plans to balance rural & urban ratio,
0 0 Defining 'Rights of residents' and protecting them will go a long way in ensuring security and social harmony in Indian society.  Parking vehicles in front of residences, playing and assembly of people, loud-speaker or vehicular or other noise, creating pollution or dumping garbage near residences: all these are to be considered as violation of 'Rights of residents'.  Legal and government support should be provided to prevent citizen rights. Then, dominance of bad over good could be prevented.
0 0 Govt should allow artist to paint railway stations boogies, public buses / transport, roads etc and put their name and signature + artist photo if they want. This is win win situation for both. Artist will get publicity + govt will save money in painting their assets + city will be beautified. Eg. - Public get bored of seeing same color boogie of local trains in Mumbai for ages. If this is implemented, then public can expect different artistic colors in all trains etc.
0 0 Success of Swachha Bharat will be dependent on the working of local governments (Panchayat, Municipality, city corporations).  Corporators and other local representatives are to be inspired to keep the city clean. Initiatives of Central and state governments can reach citizens only through the local government and elected representatives. High levels of compliance with principles of urban planning, not violating building plans, providing adequate parking space in new constructions are required
2 0 Sir, Please implement reservation system only on basis of income, but not on caste system. I see my friends who are open category students, but poor, they can't get any assistance from government. IN future if it continuous then people forms groups on basis of caste.  This may collapse unity of this great country
1 0 I feel current generation is loosing importance of Army men mainly children. To make children realize the value of army, schools should invite Army men / Ex-Army men from their locality or near by and honor them during Republic day &/ Independence day. This will give dual benefit, 1st Army veterans or current serving Army men will get their honor form locals + children from childhood will be related to this issue. This will also help army to get aspirants candidates in future.
0 0 Dear Sir, First of all I Salute to our military soldiers who have lost their lives for the sake of our conuntry. I am proud to be indian. I belong to Powerlinks Transmission Company Limited , It is a joint venture of Tata Power and Powergrid. Now winter season has to be start and there will be a problem of Electricity Transmission Lines due to dense fog and other problem is that some of the villagers used to fly kites near the transmission lines due to infringement of Kite thread made by china ,
1 0 Dear PM, There should be a phone number on which for each missed call Rs 10-15 should be charged which should directly go to 'Army Battle Casualty Fund'. Advantage: 1. Rs 10-15 is very small amount so a person with minimum income can contribute. 2. Everyone has mobile these days, so its very easy to contribute (no internet banking/no visit a bank/any other payment mode). This will give common people a sense of direct connect with our Security Forces by directly helping their families.
0 0 Just an thought for getting info on domestic black money - Govt should give the whistle-blower / informer 10% of the amount black money recovered + 90% of the amount should be put in the village (of his choice) to make it smart village + to give his name to one of the street in an honor. If the informer lives in city, then his building / ward / area - roads, waste mgt, sewerage etc should be repaired or developed or develop public transport in his area etc
0 0 Subject: MUNNA solution for a BIGGER problem There remains a shortage of coins in Indian market all the time. A big cause for the shortage is the innocent ‘good’ habit of coin collection by young kids, but they store (‘stash’) the  coins for several months/years in their money boxes. Our beloved PM may call upon the children to frequently take out coins and hand over to their parents in exchange for currency notes while they leave for shopping (and gradually exchange for big currency notes)
0 0 Sir I agree many toilets have been built and more are under construction, but people don't use them as they are dirty and smell badly. Waterless urinals are installed in many public toilets abroad, the urine passes through a trap which contains a chemical gel and which neutralises the smell. The urine just passes on to the waste pipe, and there is no need to waste precious water on flushing.

0 0 respected Sir, On this platform I want to ask that you are believing that air-connectivity is very important for progress and development of any city. Then why the 9th largest city of the country didn't given the international airport till date? The diamond city which produces 8 diamond out of 10 at the world level and which produces high amount of fabric each day is lacking in the air connectivity issue. So what you are going to do for this issue before state election of Gujarat?
0 0 (1) Now a days on-line shopping like Amzon, Snapdeal, Flipcart etc are attracting customers and manufactures are also selling their good in very less price than MRP to these on-line service providers, is it possible government to intervene and get on-line shopping away by regulating manufactures to direct sale their products to customers without giving brokerage ( to on-line companies (2) Best affordable (rate)daily need items for common man (3)Revie on MP & MLA funds and its proper utilisation
0 0 Sir instead of unsafe and polluting crackers let us have huge and beautiful public displays of fireworks as they do in advanced countries. The whole country stops to watch the fireworks on Bastille Day in France or the King's birthday in Thailand. Let us light up our homes and cities but we can have safe fireworks carried out by professionals which would be truly spectacular.
1 0 All dependants of defence personnel who lost their lives for our country should be given at least amt of Rs. 51 lakhs with jobs to their kins, free education with financial assistance to their children.

Accounts details should be published in newspapers/TV/govt bills etc.
0 0 Dear PM,India belongs to a way long traditions and cultures but always said to be land of extremes.Many people here are always following blind faith ex.Devdaasis(small girls) dedicated to goddess Yelamma who later join the occupation of prostitution.We have to raise a voice for controlling this types of extremes.And also at least show some respect towards third genders and child labours.

0 0 Dear Sir, One suggestion please . I am working in L&T Oman from last 6 year and I have seen in whole GGC countries they have very good system for renewal of car insurance and registration , In India : Car insurance and Registration are not linked up therefore you can renew your car registration without renewing of car insurance. However in GGC , car insurance and registration are linkup with each other,person cannot renew his car registration unless his car is insured Abul Kalam Sohar,Oman
0 0 Dear Prime Minister Beti Bachao Beti Padhao is very close to my heart. I do not have the good luck of having a daughter of my own but my heart cries for every girl child who is not given an opportunity to live her life. I have a lot of desire to work in this direction but I'm directionless. I hope you can shed some light on how many women like me can contribute to this noble cause. The initiative is excellent but it needs foot soldiers to become successful
0 0 The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao movement is a revolutionary one. However it has to reach the grass root levels. The idea that a girl child is a burden needs to me removed for which public education is a must. If the government can film a series of short stories which cover the life story of successful women ( sports, business, academics, etc) and relay this as episodes on DD or any other private channel it will make a huge impact on the minds of people. stories of women from rural background.

0 0 We are still imbibed in the principle of tax the tax payer. A new thinking needs to be brought in. Incentive the tax payer. He is the gold medalist. Help more people win medals. If not we are only making sure that the hardworking honest citizen stops his hard work or migrates outside of India. An example, is why is loans not given easily to an individual who has a high growth in his taxes. There is no evaluation for this and no incentive to pay higher tax.

1 0 Sir, i would like to say that e governance will be a tremendous idea to remove corruption from the root level. So i would like to propose that even PANCHAYATS and Nagar Nigam should also be under e governance and there should be a provision to complaint about these structures.

0 0 Respected Sir, thanks 4 opportunity! I would really appreciate if you call upon the Indian to develop their emotional intelligence and rational critical thinking. There are many issues that can easily be solved if we have these attributes under our cap. I STRONGLY believe that if you hail us on this issue, it will become a national movement since people will try to understand what our Prime Minister is talking about and how it will impact our life. Thanks for hearing from us, Bhupendra IITD
0 0 Dear Sir, no one understands common man problems without to be a common man. Take an shared auto from kapashera border to Gurgaon bus adda, then you can understand. It's my request to hire some civilian and take there true feedback's of doing whole day struggle of a common man, from going office to taking bus metro, in market, at railways station during festival and all other things happen in a common man life.
0 0 Respected Sir, caste based Reservations system have become a big challenge india's progress. To overcome this system, we should do the following : 1. Provide educational,social and monetary incentives and facilities to economically backward caste/community at the education level (upto graduation level). 2. after that they will become more competitive when they come out fro college. 3. Remove asking caste/Religion in all types of forms. 4. remove article 370 for better development of J&K.
0 0 Respected PM ,first I convey my Deepavali vazhalthukal. As my suggestion would, like all nations is watching us, as we grow as a signature policy of this Government , 1.Nationalise all the water bodies combine the water resources, to set right, scarcity, drought, flood etc,  2. Many cases pending in various court in our country, though the judiciary gives  timebound judgements to various Dept's, to execute the orders in time why cannot the judiciary may be fixed a timelimit to dispose a case
0 0 Respected sir, With all due respect i would like to draw your attention on liquor ban in Gujarat. Though it's enforced in the Gujarat almost 50 years back, still it's easily available and even a 14 year old kid can easily access it.I have grownup in a small town in the Gujarat and well aware of the situation there.If a 14 years kid knows the place where he can get the liquor i am sure the enforcement responsible must be aware of that. #MannKiBaat, #MyGov, #AIR, #PMOnRadio Thanks Milap
0 0 Dear PM Kindly making inclusive new educational policy why not establish Govt entrance coaching (GATE, IEE ,NEET...........) centers in rural area? your skill development programme is good scheme but do you know it executed properly? no it does not executed properly all is doing for monetary benefits please reform it.
1 0 Dear sir JAY HIND I want to talk about our country's growing population. Now we are near about 130 Cr and it increases galloping way.

0 0 Dear Prime Minister, the medical treatment provided to the poor is not adequate in Kerala, leaving ample opportunity for the private hospitals to loot them. The doctors are promoting private labs and hospitals. Equipping the hospitals with sufficient facilities and staff on reasonable charges to APL people and free for BPL people may kindly be considered.
0 0 Respected Sir, Wishing you a Happy Diwali in advance.  Sir, in the honour/respect of our Great Soldiers and to motivate other citizens of our country towards nationalism, it would be better if appeal be made to sung any Our National Patriotic  song in the begining/end of each musical / social function organized by the our fellow citizen. Without which no permission be granted to organize function in public place. With kind regards Jai Hind J.S. Pandey
0 0 Sir happy Diwali, I just wants to know what is your take on education policy as we know what in our country is facing unemployment problem which child extensive privatization of education.in our own Maharashtra near about 60 thousand
0 0 Respected Modi Ji, I wish this Diwali you need to talk to the Educators of our country who represent the light in the true sense in Mann ki Baat. Bharat was a knowledge society in the past and it still is though we are not able to actualize our potential. Without bringing out a shift in our primary education we won't be able to transform the country into an inspired Nation. All the best and wish you Shubh Deepawali.
0 0 Sir, Please make government officials responsible for infrastructure projects more accountable. For all the roads that are laid - within 6 months craters start developing. This is the tax payer's money at work. Why shouldn't the government officials be made accountable for such poor quality roads? Why should contractors not be deducted of their fees if they cant provide a minimum of 2 year's warranty/ guarantee on the roads that they lay? Please have a comprehensive policy for this. Regards
0 0 Dear PM Sir, Reservations to SC/ST/OBC have become a big challenge to General category people.Govt. should provide ample educational,social and monetary incentives and facilities to such categories instead of caste,community based reservations.I agree that it is most onerous task but then who else but you can set things right.
0 0 Dear Prime Minister Modi ji, I have a concern about reservation system in our country. The reservation system is quite complicated and cannot be removed easily. Because of this lot of communal clashes are taking place between reserved and non-reserved communities. I have a solution for this. Why don't you promote and implement the way of giving up reservation as you did in the case of gas subsidy? It will also benefit people in reserved community who are below poverty line. Thank you. Jai hind
0 0 I want to talk about our Soldiers.You always say that you respect and value lives of our Soldiers but I think in reality they are not getting what they deserve.Why they have to fight for their Rights?they risk their lives,they spend atleast 20hrs in work,hardly sleep and can't give their time to their Families..Infact 7th pay commission was just an insult to them and Now this..?? http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/new-govt-order-reduces-military-st...

They have transformed their country by focusing on giving high quality education and now we can see them. Please sir I want to see INDIA in top countries but for that education and health system needs to be in order.🙏

0 0 We just returned from Kashi.We were shocked to see cows at every corner of Varanasi. As it is traffic is horrible and on top of that no one follows any rules. These cows can be hurt any moment by vehicles. The roads leading to the Dashashwamedh ghat should be made totally vehicle free, only for the aged and handicapped electric vehicles should ply. The hawkers will never move so people should at least be able to walk without being knocked down by bikes.People still take bath with soaps as no o

0 0 Sir, Happy Diwali to you. celebrating diwali is the good wins over bad the time are changing celebrating diwali pose has changed we are using crackers which is very harm to our nature. Our India pleads to conservation of environment & nature so that we signed on COP Paris agreement on Oct 2 China crackers are available in the market which is very dangerous for our mother earth please convey this message to our fellow Indians #MannkiBaat #AIR #PMOnRadio
0 0 sir, I dont know if this thing is to be shared on this forum or not, but I tried all the ways to reach you yet failed. Can you do something for our judiciary system ? My family will not have a Diwali this year as the only son of my parents is behind the bars from last 6 months in some fake case..we are not able to bring him out, all because of lack of investigation and lack of judicials in system. (the concern is on leaves, and the application can not be listed at any other bench). Please Help
0 0 I would suggest to convince people to leave behind one bad habit on the occasion of Diwali and opt a new habit. e. g Bad habit could be smoking, not respecting fellow passengers, Not giving seats to fellow needy travelers. Good habits could be opting for Surrounding cleanliness mission, respecting women, children's, elderly people, Having sound proof and pollution free Diwali etc. If Mr. PM says convey this kind of message, am sure people will follow it and it will root some moral values
0 0 Dear Prime Minister, kindly talk about our own education system... The one which focussed on hard work.... Not the present one which thinks child needs to be cuddled only... The children today do not even know tables of 2 and 3.they cannot even read,Specially in govt skuls. Private skul k bacche sab pdh lete hai.. Kyu ki wahan school aaj bhi waise hi pdha rhe hai... Homework abi bhi utna hi diya jata hai.. Not like our govt. Sir i resigned from kvs bcoz of this. Shubham pathak
0 0 Dear Sir, Thank you for bringing issues concerning the servicemen to the fore. After grant of OROP, inauguration of Shaurya Smarak, the initiative of sandesh2soldier is laudable. However, a lot needs to be done on issues concerning service condition of soldiers. Anomalies of CPC, grant of NFU, Equivalence with other Services are some of the issues which need to be addressed at the earliest as these are effecting the morale of soldiers. I suggest forming of a permanent Military Commission
0 1 As I have seen to the best of my knowledge that Sir you are working day and night but your co Woking staff are lazy and corrupt so please wok a bet on that other wise you won't be in the next election because of them...
0 0 Dear Modi Ji Lets take some serious step towards digital currency with digital literacy. If currency is a number why need a note for that.We can store it in our cellphone/cards etc. Physical currency free India is corruption free India. Jai Hind #MannkiBaat #MyGov #AIR #PMOnRadia
0 0 Exsisting complicated processes in every sector are the biggest obstacle in our country. I think we should simply the processes in every sector by removing paper work with help of IT. Also there should be a way where the youth can participate in government not just on forums but people with knowledge should be given a chance to improve the processes in Government, I am ready to do it if given an opportunity.  #MannKiBaat, #MyGov, #AIR, #PMOnRadio
0 0 Hi Dear Modi Sir! I have only one suggestion. We need to add meditation classes in schools, colleges and universities as well. We all know the benefits of meditation or Yoga. It develops the sensitivity and consciousness. If we have higher consciousness then rest works may be done very easily without any effort. If everyone in the country is taught meditation, we will eliminate violence within one generation.So please please do something for this. Thank you Regards, Dinesh

0 0 Dear Sir, you have taken so many crucial decision in national interest. You have curbed so many sources of corruption at national level. I want to bring one more corruption into your notice which is becoming a huge pain for people. That is in the name of ICUs in Hospitals. Family members become really helpless, if any patient goes into ICU/OT. What happens inside ICUs nobody can know. They are doing any operation or not, even patient is alive or not no body knows. If any death happens, people do
0 0 Hello sir,this time while addressing the nation please do mention about not only armed force but also all those security forces who keep us safe from within the borders. please try to mention the sacrifice made by their families,who most of the time celebrate their festivals without them. When a soldier returns home that is itself a festival like scene at home. hope you would consider my suggestion worth mentioning,. Jai Hindi!!!
0 0 happy diwali to indian army who risks their lives and died proudly for this country i salute them jai hind
0 0 Saying "Happy Diwali"to army is a welcome initiative.I did it.But my mind says to do more.In fact after Uri Attack some spurious websites were asking for donations and I was about to fall in trap.From then, I began to think, Why not an Authentic Prime Minister's Fund fully dedicated to the Indian Soldiers where people can donate as per capability - May be a Rupee?Let the donation be like crowd funding with online credit facility.Its good if data analysis possible for finding donors category.
0 0 Dear Sir, Now a days everyone is talking about GST Bill, that if it will come then India's GDP will increase. I am not a economist person but as a common citizen i know one thing taking Bill for every purchase will surely help India.

0 0 Respected Sir i would like to add my views on swatch  Bharat abhiyan. Sir, i am seeing and feeling that awareness about cleanliness has increased very significantly across the country by the steps taken by you and people are contributing as much as they could. but just want to highlight one point that is still a part of our municipal corporations are not able to provide proper collection, segregation and disposal of wastes and garbage. if it is improved surely India will be cleaner & greener.
0 0 Greetings Sir, Diwali is round the clock and as usual poor potters who make make Diya and other items of decorations for Diwali are gonna return empty handed because people tendency to buy OTHER products. So it will be really good if people start considering buying these goods too. And second is the amount of pollution caused by crackers. If everyone would just try to reduce the crackers they burn then it would definitely bring change.
0 0 Through Community Policing for the Swatch Bharat Abhiyan, People will be made responsible for ensuring cleanliness at public places. This will also give them sense of ownership for public places/property. If public develop sense of ownership for the public property then they will definetely start keeping it clean and will start monitoring that it is not uncleaned by anyone. Community Policing could serve the purpose for the success of Swatch Bharat Abhiyan. Thanks
0 0 Resppected Sir, I like to Congratulate u for the kind of hard work u r doing for us. We are actually very proud to have u as our Prime Minister. My suggestion is regarding the Swach Bharat Abhiyan. People throw waste on roads and public places.There is need to sensitize public that public property is for public therefore it is their duty to protect & make the it clean and if someone make it dirty,people should monitor it through Community policing.This willcreate sense ofOwnership among ppl
0 0 Everyone should understand their responsibility to words social works doctor should give at least 1 hours to poor people on daily basis and school should also. Business man should organize training programs in their areas so it will be good for nations. Government officers should also come on ground reality and support to the people of India. Government hospital staff should only need to shoft spoken. The innocent people wants this only.
0 0 Respected PM I have an idea for those people of India who they have saficent income, they should use 10% of their incomes in social activities in their area only. Like their village, Mohallah,city from himself do not give money to anyone if no lights on social places they can put street lights and also they can use that money to make mobile toilets and many more thing to do. And this will helps in nation building.

0 0 Sir, 11 November marked as Remembrance Day around the world to remember the members of their armed forces who have died in the line of duty is sadly not marked in India despite many Indians showing great valour in both world wars. I request you to make the use of this opportunity and call upon fellow Indians to mark a moment of silence on 11 November at 11:00 a.m. I would also request you to carry out commemoration programmes on 11 November across India.
0 0 Dear Reader My concern is for farmers of India who struggle a lot due to the continuous hard work they do,to decrease that we can take the following steps- 1.Out of all the farmers very few have tractors and other machines. 2.The districts of India,where most of the people are farmers should have a department/office where we can have all the important machines. 3.Farmer who wants any kind of work to be done in his field can approach to the office. There are more steps but word limit is less

1 0 Dear Sir, Nowdays mobile usage is everywhere. It has become a part our daily work. And our mobile number is connected/linked to various financial transactions. Ex: ATM withdrawals, Bank OTP confirmation...etc. So it is very important to secure these transactions. Recent incident many bank debit card details has been hacked. So my suggestion is to make strict policies towards financial transactions, implementing bio metric system while ATM withdrawal, instead of Mobile OTP is the best option.

0 0 Road accidents is a major cause of deaths and disabilities in India. Our youth are the most affected and we lose hunderds of lives in their prime. I would like to suggest that we introduce 3-4 hours of annual mandatory road safety curriculum right from high school to graduation. 4-6 years of regular exposure to road safety will go a long way in changing the road safety culture among youth. I am ready to help with such an initiative.

0 0 Respected PM ji, jai jawan kosh is once again reverberating  in air by your call. But you have to give attention to Jai kishan kosh also. Farmers issues are  to be  resolved and the MSP of their produce must be fixed to an amount of half of the retail selling price to consumers.  Govt vision and mission should move from cities to villages. Inequality existing between farming community and salaried group should be minimised.

1 0 Respected Sir, There are various meetings that have concluded regarding climate change, which is accompanied by  the ratification of Paris Agreement by the Government of India on Gandhi Jayanti, and recent meeting in Rwanda regarding the HFCs. There is very little awareness among people regarding these climate change talks and the position of India regarding this.

0 0 Sir, Saffron is among the most expensive spice and also considered as "Red Gold".Kashmir is the only state where This "gold" can be grown. It is of strategic importance. Saffron is a labor-intensive crop which needs the flimsy crimson red strands to be plucked laboriously by hand. I would like to ask my government to motivate the production which will on one hand increase the income and on other hand give mass employment in our beloved Kashmir. Thanks.

0 0 Sir, My point is that Seventh Pay Commission recommendations have been worst in the last 17 years.  The people are unhappy with the increase in salaries and pension recommended by the commission because the government has failed to rein in inflation.People are unhappy and dissatisfied, especially those working in lower levels in the government because inflation has gone up. The price rise has kept the benefits of pay commission from reaching people. We will wait for next 10 years. Thankyou sir.
0 0 Sir You are the true leader of this country Shri Narendra Modi Ji we(youth) of this country inspire alot from your speeches which addresses nation as one .Media should be controlled by government if any one shows false news they should be punished seriously .All government sectors should be digitalized to save time and to avoid corruption

I ve gr8 ideas to strengthen our economy will tell later

0 0 Dear Sir, health upset and Hospital expense have become common terms that are being used today. When any person has health upset immediately he thinks about hospital expense.

0 0 Dear Sir, Lots of people have joined the campaign "Give It Up" & given up the LPG subsidy In Maharashtra, C M Devendraji Phadanvis has announced the same scheme for Ration Card holders But, in many, almost all cases related to the Govt, Ration card is the compulsory requirement as one of the document Most of the people are holding the Ration Card for the sake of this only, & not using for the subsidy. For such card holders, the subsidized material is being used in black market
