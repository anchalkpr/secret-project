The Open Forums invites you to talk about the menace of drugs. Share how you feel this menace can be mitigated, what steps can be taken to get youngsters out of this. You can share anecdotes – how you saved children from this menace of drugs or if you have had a personal experience. NGOs working in this sphere should contribute. Your contribution would be a major step in freeing India from the menace of drugs.
